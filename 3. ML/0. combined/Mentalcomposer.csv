nta,Mentalcomposer
haha your brother and his wife  arent very self aware are they,Mentalcomposer
i hope you let him know all the years he and his wife tormented you about your weight is the absolute reason you can be rude to her,Mentalcomposer
good for you,Mentalcomposer
to all saying e s h,Mentalcomposer
she was a teenager being made fun of by grown adults that in itself warrants her clapping back,Mentalcomposer
gross,Mentalcomposer
does she know this,Mentalcomposer
time for an honest convo about where you two are,Mentalcomposer
she may think you are going to be a cute little family and youre over here thinking youll take care of the baby because youre going to do that right  but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple,Mentalcomposer
its not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant and you both comparent but not have a relationship,Mentalcomposer
id have to ask him about it,Mentalcomposer
if he was that drunk its possible he doesnt even remember it and continues  to hang out with these people who are clearly not his friends,Mentalcomposer
youve known him for 4 years does he look 20 or 16  do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past look for little clues as to a timeline,Mentalcomposer
or he knows it happened and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk way way too far but idk these ppl,Mentalcomposer
either way it warrants a conversation,Mentalcomposer
he may be embarrassed but if he cant discuss it with you after 4 years together i wont say its a problem per say but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now,Mentalcomposer
right now im kinda obsessed with married at first sight,Mentalcomposer
its a train wreck but i cant help myself,Mentalcomposer
does it not seem odd to anyone that,Mentalcomposer
you live outside of the country your godfather gets diagnosed decides to rewrite his will and,Mentalcomposer
the only person gf told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother,Mentalcomposer
the one who got everything,Mentalcomposer
im calling shenanigans on your brother hes gross taking advantage of a sick old man,Mentalcomposer
youre broken up  stop obsessing over did she or didnt she cheat,Mentalcomposer
what diff would it make to know at this point anyway,Mentalcomposer
will you be more angry and what purpose will that serve,Mentalcomposer
being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet cause thats a sure fire way to stay single nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the past,Mentalcomposer
block her and her friend move on,Mentalcomposer
but theyre not that young if he gave them cars and expensive trips,Mentalcomposer
and they all still have their college fund they lose nothing while hes still alive,Mentalcomposer
he didnt say how many nieces and nephews he has but his wealth seems to be enough that even if they dont get the whole thing they will all still be getting a nice chunk of change  its his million dollar insurance investments and his home and a summer home,Mentalcomposer
its sad really that these young adults are so selfish to think he shouldnt leave his daughter the bulk of his estate,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if anyone from his family has ever expressed any happiness that this man is becoming a father they all know how they felt when they had their kids,Mentalcomposer
this is your first relationship and it has moved way way way too fast,Mentalcomposer
the find my iphone thing would have been an instant break up,Mentalcomposer
if you break up her mental state is not your concern what did she do before you were around,Mentalcomposer
anyway what you need is some time to yourself,Mentalcomposer
stop picking her up every single day,Mentalcomposer
go back to your 3 dates a week,Mentalcomposer
you will have time for yourselves and will also have things to talk about when you get together,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people you need other things in your life besides her,Mentalcomposer
and tell her that you will not  note will not  entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day she can either stop sending them or be prepared for them to be ignored,Mentalcomposer
you are an adult you have a job you cant be watching tik toks all damn day,Mentalcomposer
you have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a talk with his mother is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what hes doing if she is worried then you two need to decide what to do next,Mentalcomposer
if he has a therapist maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what hes been saying,Mentalcomposer
maybe he needs in house mental health care,Mentalcomposer
im sorry youre going thru this its painful when your kids are struggling,Mentalcomposer
you are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be,Mentalcomposer
good job school dad,Mentalcomposer
if he had a draw id just throw them in but it feels odd to just throw them  on a shelf all willy nilly idk,Mentalcomposer
now i feel like a weirdo,Mentalcomposer
im a woman and i do like your gf and it goes in a draw,Mentalcomposer
but i do the laundry and i fold my husbands underwear boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them,Mentalcomposer
his dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom,Mentalcomposer
so he stacks his undies so in  order to stack they need to be folded,Mentalcomposer
makes perfect sense to me,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
the idea that shes more worried about talking to him is a problem,Mentalcomposer
she might find that after spending however long24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time,Mentalcomposer
and she gets to hang with her gfs for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
i realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday maybe shes one of them,Mentalcomposer
me ill celebrate whenever just wish me hb  on the day and were good i dont even want a gift just take me to dinner,Mentalcomposer
i tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia,Mentalcomposer
i sprain my ankles pretty easily so i,Mentalcomposer
thought it was just that,Mentalcomposer
hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day,Mentalcomposer
i was on vacation at the time,Mentalcomposer
had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all,Mentalcomposer
got home a week later went to ortho and the break was stable so i got a walking boot and had to go for physical therapy,Mentalcomposer
its been a little more than 4 months and the swelling is gone but i still feel little twinges in the ankle or leg at times,Mentalcomposer
age doesnt really have anything to do with it,Mentalcomposer
i started with just store bought readers probably around 40,Mentalcomposer
when they stopped working i needed rx glasses but at that time my doc did say that i probably would need distance glasses as i got  not so young he never said the word old,Mentalcomposer
now i wear progressive lenses all the time cause i cant see near or far,Mentalcomposer
ill admit i still hate wearing glasses i never feel like they look good on my face ive also never wore sunglasses for the same reason,Mentalcomposer
i asked about contacts but that was a no go too,Mentalcomposer
its been a month if she cant compromise so you both can schedule your daily call earlier at this point she never will,Mentalcomposer
schedule a 15 min call at 8 pm then she can both go do whatever and you can go to sleep when you need to,Mentalcomposer
also texting is ok too you dont have to have marathon calls every night,Mentalcomposer
of course they did,Mentalcomposer
have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their compromises and their thats what we were proposing all alongs,Mentalcomposer
this whole routine is getting old,Mentalcomposer
i think it doesnt matter that its  a you feel as opposed to her feeling that way,Mentalcomposer
shes not going to admit shes just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her so it doesnt  even make sense to ask add in that its difficult to talk to her about money why is that,Mentalcomposer
you think this relationship isnt an equal financial partnership in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore,Mentalcomposer
shes a gf not a wife there is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school she supported her d before you came along and she can go back to doing just that,Mentalcomposer
youre going to work part time to basically help support her and her d why would you do that youll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week,Mentalcomposer
its time you decide what you want not what you think is the right thing to do as far as gf is concerned,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i dont think theres anything wrong with that,Mentalcomposer
we do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away,Mentalcomposer
we just had a childs bday the day before mothers day and we all gave the moms their gifts then,Mentalcomposer
no sense driving on sat seeing everyone and then driving again on sunday,Mentalcomposer
just give your dad a heads up that since youre making the drive for the graduation its silly to do it again just a week later he shouldnt have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
hes afraid youll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf,Mentalcomposer
i might accidentally on purpose run into gf at daycare one day if at least ask the daycare people about her does she seem like shes nice enough to your d,Mentalcomposer
doesnt the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up d and using her dads pin to do it,Mentalcomposer
you would think they would want to know who she is give her her own pin and have a contact number,Mentalcomposer
stop trying to find your one and only that will lead you to settling just so you have someone which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long,Mentalcomposer
take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with,Mentalcomposer
this is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships you dont want to get back in the same routine just because its what you know  does that make sense wasnt sure how to put it,Mentalcomposer
when you feel you are at your strongest then you can put yourself out there and start dating again,Mentalcomposer
and maybe you can be the one to go after the person you want to be with iow ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking how many guys do we not date because they didnt ask,Mentalcomposer
itll happen maybe when you least expect it,Mentalcomposer
but is he in therapy,Mentalcomposer
its great that your bro adopted an older kid but he had to know this child would come with some issues  its been years what are they doing to help him,Mentalcomposer
then thats what you should do,Mentalcomposer
move out to the country,Mentalcomposer
you two are never going to agree on lifestyle and be assured where you live will dictate your lifestyle,Mentalcomposer
youll stay in london and be unhappy and years from now youll realize you should have left years ago,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
as long as when applying for this job your wife knew there would be travel,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine you went thru the application interview process and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it,Mentalcomposer
but also its only 4 days with one almost 4 yo why cant she handle that,Mentalcomposer
i would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks hes still open to the idea she needs to just ask him,Mentalcomposer
its a simple do you want kids  that is either a yes or a no question not a discussion,Mentalcomposer
although we all know he doesnt she needs to hear it point blank,Mentalcomposer
why in the world would you volunteer that info,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and its kind of gross that you even told her,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing a gentleman never tells,Mentalcomposer
reditt has a mix of everything,Mentalcomposer
i like seeing how diff generations deal with issues,Mentalcomposer
theres funny sad stupid weird crazy posts its amazing to see glimpses into how people live,Mentalcomposer
and sometimes i feel i can give sound advice you know from being soooo old,Mentalcomposer
buy bitcoin,Mentalcomposer
this was said in the very beginning by my 20 something son,Mentalcomposer
but at the time i knew nothing except i thought bc was being used for things on the dark web,Mentalcomposer
and since i dont even know how to get on the dark web thought there was no reason to buy,Mentalcomposer
yeah missed out on that big time,Mentalcomposer
now i listen when he suggests something especially when i dont know anything about it dont always do it but i listen,Mentalcomposer
does your state have aca insurance,Mentalcomposer
id look into that first the subsidies really can make it affordable,Mentalcomposer
but id start with just a regular doctor visit  it may be something simple as an infection try to find a clinic in your area,Mentalcomposer
so hes okay with you feeding him but has a problem when you offer to feed his gf who just happens to be in the house its not like you only cook when shes there,Mentalcomposer
why is he afraid youre gonna steal her with food is he afraid shes only hanging out with him because you feed her,Mentalcomposer
ask roomie what the problem is and then stop doing what he doesnt like,Mentalcomposer
if that means not feeding her then stop feeding him too,Mentalcomposer
you sound like a great roomie you mow and offered to wash their cars,Mentalcomposer
who does that youre like southern hospitality on steroids,Mentalcomposer
so i saw that there are 175 or so winners of this award,Mentalcomposer
surely they all cant make an acceptance speech,Mentalcomposer
so my q is is tw slated to say something,Mentalcomposer
and if she is supposed to talk why her shes hardly the most esteemed of the list of winners,Mentalcomposer
i can understand others going to meet and make connections but no one wants to meet or connect with her shes hardly the it person at this point,Mentalcomposer
on the other hand might be nice if she went and was shunned but wed never know that anyway,Mentalcomposer
dont feel bad i think the same thing,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how did a bunch of 14 yos get to a cabin 2 hours away,Mentalcomposer
someone had to drive them,Mentalcomposer
and who leaves a bunch of 14 yos on their own,Mentalcomposer
the girl whose cabin it is had to have known there were no beds in the cabin,Mentalcomposer
everything about this was a mess from the get go,Mentalcomposer
you did nothing wrong you had company who were taking up sleeping space in your home,Mentalcomposer
and if you had a bunch of young girls sleep in the house with you and your friends i guarantee someone would have had a problem with that too and that optic is worse,Mentalcomposer
what kind of work do you do,Mentalcomposer
if it is mentally taxing that could be why youre exhausted dont discount the amount of energy you expend by literally thinking and problem solving,Mentalcomposer
if thats not it then you have the classic  a body at rest tends to stay at rest get up and walk around every hour or so,Mentalcomposer
you also work 6 days a week,Mentalcomposer
and dont go home and just sit  do something anything even for 15 min at first  walk around the block do 10 push ups,Mentalcomposer
i have been down the alf and nh  road with my sister the diff is she is disabled and had zero assets,Mentalcomposer
can you clarify something please,Mentalcomposer
assisted living costs 6500 month,Mentalcomposer
but you said your dad has an income of 6800mo does this money include his 401,Mentalcomposer
he has enough income to pay for this,Mentalcomposer
why do you think he cant afford this,Mentalcomposer
he of course is not ever going to be able to give your brother any money ever ever ever again,Mentalcomposer
hell have 300 extra every month you can bring him what he needs from this money deodorant clothes etc,Mentalcomposer
when his money runs out he can apply for medicare and i know they cover nursing home not sure about alf  i think only if disabled but even then we had to private pay for 2 yrs before my sister qualified,Mentalcomposer
your dad may well be ready for a nh by the time hes 86,Mentalcomposer
i think this will work,Mentalcomposer
if he can pay cash for 6 or more years he can transfer the house now then it wont be in the look back period make double sure what the look back period is  i think it may be longer but im going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments,Mentalcomposer
also when you move him in go see the social services office they should have one,Mentalcomposer
explain to them that your dad is private pay his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it at all,Mentalcomposer
have them put it in his admission record watch them do it explain that linda is pushing this and its not going to happen,Mentalcomposer
you might want to get a poa for your dad that way he cant be held if he signs anything,Mentalcomposer
i love a sweeter breading on pork it just seems to go together,Mentalcomposer
i havent done frosted flakes just because i dont normally buy that cereal,Mentalcomposer
try adding some crushed almonds to it too,Mentalcomposer
nta because ops fianc bro to the sil was in agreement with how everything was planned did his sister go complain to him i wonder,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt really matter that sil blocked this couple,Mentalcomposer
in a couple of months they wont ever be seeing each other because this couple is banned from bringing their baby to any family functions anyway,Mentalcomposer
lets see how long that lasts no one can tell me that grandma isnt going to want to see that baby at christmas,Mentalcomposer
and op if your in laws want to do separate holidays so sil doesnt have to see your baby id advise against it we are either a family or we are not,Mentalcomposer
at this point send 1 group message to anyone who has your number then block all of them you dont need this crap from anyone,Mentalcomposer
id mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that,Mentalcomposer
then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed,Mentalcomposer
then nicely mention they can all go to hell,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how old is this guy,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt let him in either even if i heard him this is lower than even basic adulting,Mentalcomposer
he remembers to lock the door and that doesnt instantly make him realize he needs a key,Mentalcomposer
you can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did,Mentalcomposer
not going to be popular but oh well,Mentalcomposer
honestly i think your wife is just done with parenting altogether its easy to just say go out and play,Mentalcomposer
you  bathed them took to urgent care went to pharmacy made breakfast and she hadnt even gotten out of bed yet then you still had to go fill the prescription,Mentalcomposer
and then she gives you attitude and decides she isnt talking to you,Mentalcomposer
im all for giving the sahp a day to sleep in and taking over the kids but when my spouse tells me its urgent care time you bet im up and seeing whats going on has she always been so irresponsible,Mentalcomposer
this relationship has run its course,Mentalcomposer
its extremely common when ppl start dating as teens,Mentalcomposer
but you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship thats a cop out,Mentalcomposer
you knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you im shocked you were the one who had to tell her,Mentalcomposer
you havent said much about your gf reaction is she not upset how could she even want to still live with you,Mentalcomposer
are you planning on living together until sept  thats a mistake,Mentalcomposer
doesnt your school break for summer go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there,Mentalcomposer
me too,Mentalcomposer
just never liked her,Mentalcomposer
maybe its time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you to the kids if they dont know,Mentalcomposer
that way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says,Mentalcomposer
they are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and id expect them to decline any invites where she will be,Mentalcomposer
your h can go alone he is the one who didnt put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning,Mentalcomposer
i can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate but what op is asking about has less to do with that,Mentalcomposer
the way i read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple its their personal relationship they are worried about,Mentalcomposer
and in that case the transitioning one is not really reassuring op  why shouldnt both of them be each others support ops life is drastically changing also she is going from having a male partner to having a female partner its a lot to handle and their concerns shouldnt be discounted just because shes not the one going thru the physical transition they need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there,Mentalcomposer
op you need to explain to your partner what youre feeling and thinking your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in,Mentalcomposer
i dont think id want anyone in my home without me being there even if you know half this couple,Mentalcomposer
isnt it kind of understood that youd all be going back to your home together at the end of the night thats what i would expect if i was the friend,Mentalcomposer
maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets you should def acknowledge it,Mentalcomposer
i always wonder tho you spent a few hours with this new person did any of you actually try to talk to him get to know him,Mentalcomposer
its hard being the new one its natural to be the more quiet one in this setting,Mentalcomposer
if you did and he didnt really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going then great but usually its the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in which if youre not an outgoing personality is hard to do,Mentalcomposer
if one wants kids then its not going to work ever,Mentalcomposer
if its a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if thats a dynamic you would be happy with,Mentalcomposer
if you can afford to live on one income and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job and the other will be ok with that then maybe try it out,Mentalcomposer
but if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again its not going to work someone will always be resentful,Mentalcomposer
ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic,Mentalcomposer
she gets out of the car no flashes,Mentalcomposer
she walks to the door no flashes,Mentalcomposer
she walks out at the end no flashes,Mentalcomposer
that would be awesome,Mentalcomposer
conventional wisdom says dont quit until you have another job lined up,Mentalcomposer
so thats what you should be doing use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job,Mentalcomposer
id you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable,Mentalcomposer
you have an education so you should be able to find something else,Mentalcomposer
and dont just take anything find something you think wont make you miserable but also that will allow you to move out even with a roommate or,Mentalcomposer
two,Mentalcomposer
dont just go thru life start taking a pro active stance with your life its the only one you got,Mentalcomposer
thats all well and good if you want to believe that but the second i walked in and saw everyone else i would have had some questions of my sister,Mentalcomposer
and i wouldnt have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship,Mentalcomposer
i believe your hopefully ex gf never mind fianc knew all along theres no way she hasnt been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out,Mentalcomposer
why you are still with this person is beyond me you obviously arent her number one and if im marrying someone thats the spot they should be in,Mentalcomposer
well id like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful,Mentalcomposer
one of mine was reading by then who do i call to get an article about them,Mentalcomposer
it still just blows my mind that any and i mean any publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two,Mentalcomposer
i cant be bothered to check cause i really dont care but did either of these two publications cover the chase non chase or do they just exist to go give platitudes,Mentalcomposer
oh did you think she was actually going to do something,Mentalcomposer
ive figured her out,Mentalcomposer
since shes a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get otherpeople to do something,Mentalcomposer
she just collects awards while others do the work,Mentalcomposer
i can understand her wanting stability you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child,Mentalcomposer
so give her a wedding maybe not the one she wants but one you can afford,Mentalcomposer
stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that youre in a partnership that person is there for the long haul through it all its less about the stuff you have,Mentalcomposer
but stability also comes in another form and keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need for a large amount of cash,Mentalcomposer
a luxury apt is nice if its well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it which it isnt because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it,Mentalcomposer
not to mention one is your childhood home,Mentalcomposer
or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child or if you have another or two or more children kids are expensive,Mentalcomposer
im one who has always believed to live below your means without denying myself certain things that i want and save as much money as possible investments and building wealth will always trump biggerbetter or more expensive every time for me,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding  and not just 1 property but both of them how big of a wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt,Mentalcomposer
i could maybe understand maybe selling the apt if its not a place you or her do not want to live maybe you cant live in the country while working in the city or for whatever reason but  in that case proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live even if you have to finance the rest,Mentalcomposer
the country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city,Mentalcomposer
talk to her it seems theres more to this is she looking at expensive luxury apts when you normally wouldnt be able to afford and wants that as status,Mentalcomposer
you should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors,Mentalcomposer
idk about the secondary stress but if you cant even get off the couch i really hope your sister isnt expecting you to entertain her and the kids,Mentalcomposer
why would she even want to come if you are so sick thats just risking her and or the kids getting sick also,Mentalcomposer
do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also i would never still visit if i knew my sister was so sick your sister is being selfish,Mentalcomposer
thank you for that,Mentalcomposer
it would take a bit of getting used to for sure,Mentalcomposer
nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers or just because they want to try living elsewhere,Mentalcomposer
and i think it really depends on how often you saw them were in the same state as our parents and sibs but they both live an hour away we see them a few times a year each holidays birthdays etc,Mentalcomposer
we def think about that when we talk of moving away like how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back,Mentalcomposer
yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd,Mentalcomposer
were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off,Mentalcomposer
why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos,Mentalcomposer
and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can,Mentalcomposer
yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd,Mentalcomposer
were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off,Mentalcomposer
why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos,Mentalcomposer
and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can,Mentalcomposer
i had heard it was because in coed classes the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle,Mentalcomposer
boys called on more for answers girls questions not being explained to satisfaction those sorts of things,Mentalcomposer
so having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else hes sharing or showing them to,Mentalcomposer
at least when your h shared he was in control im assuming by just showing the friend his phone,Mentalcomposer
and i hate to say it but you shouldnt need any affirmation from other men to make you feel good i understand missing your h but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening,Mentalcomposer
i would let h know and hope hed blast the friend and i would let the friend know what his gf said,Mentalcomposer
then id send a scathing text to gf then block her and the friend,Mentalcomposer
so wait was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them,Mentalcomposer
the article says they didnt want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour overkill much,Mentalcomposer
but was there anyone actually even following them it doesnt actually say that,Mentalcomposer
so then what go to the police station to what wait for another car oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car,Mentalcomposer
these two are only important in their own minds,Mentalcomposer
so much drama for absolutely nothing this chick lives for pictures of her was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room  gmafb,Mentalcomposer
dont be so quick to judge lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height,Mentalcomposer
but when i see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big then i wonder why the parents werent more conscious of the kids at least like they can be however big they want but wouldnt you want better for the kids,Mentalcomposer
sandals are even better than sneakers if you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too roll up the sleeves,Mentalcomposer
the idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me,Mentalcomposer
there will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one the idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to you stop looking,Mentalcomposer
but you two are young have been together since youre teens so basically what youre both saying is,Mentalcomposer
you both want to play the field sleep around and see if theres someone better out there because you havent and you dont want to regret it,Mentalcomposer
and thats fine to want to most people do that in their teens until their mid 20s or longer,Mentalcomposer
just realize this be honest and verbalize this,Mentalcomposer
if you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one you might be surprised with the reality and are you both prepared for that,Mentalcomposer
i think it depends on what youre doing after the grad ceremony,Mentalcomposer
if youre going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant then please dress accordingly,Mentalcomposer
if youre only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward then i think its ok,Mentalcomposer
but actually i hate flip flops in public especially on men so i really think you should put sneakers on,Mentalcomposer
how about nicer shorts a polo and a pair of sneakers  youre still comfy but look like you made an effort,Mentalcomposer
there are a lot of recipes that  hide veggies in regular meals try to look up some of them at least hell be getting some nutrients that way,Mentalcomposer
one i know is shredding carrot into meatloaf so things like that,Mentalcomposer
is it just a case of him not used to these veggies,Mentalcomposer
maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so hes at least eating something healthy,Mentalcomposer
does he eat fruit its not a substitute but its good for him at least,Mentalcomposer
then you can try to introduce new ones,Mentalcomposer
be patient everything is new to him and hes only 10,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
how long are you dating,Mentalcomposer
and is this your first serious relationship,Mentalcomposer
if you care for this woman at all you would let her go,Mentalcomposer
you want to go back to normal but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship,Mentalcomposer
you admit you have verbally abused her for all 4 yrs of this relationship you are not a good partner because of your anger issues,Mentalcomposer
you need to stay single get some help for your anger issues and only then should you try to have another relationship,Mentalcomposer
you cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel,Mentalcomposer
late to this thread but ive heard this is a new thing ccl is doing,Mentalcomposer
its not so much an offer anyone can earn it,Mentalcomposer
i read something about it but i think,Mentalcomposer
it works this way,Mentalcomposer
as you gamble on the ship you accrue points you always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing points do not transfer to another sailing so it didnt make much sense not to convert them you did however earn some perks on the sailing ie at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service but idk how many points you needed for any of them,Mentalcomposer
now however the new plan is that if you do not convert your points you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn,Mentalcomposer
but i believe these certificates are used for a future cruise,Mentalcomposer
so is it worth it idk but i just play whatever i would normally play and whatever i get i get i wouldnt overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points,Mentalcomposer
im harsh because honestly im gonna take care of me first,Mentalcomposer
what he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours,Mentalcomposer
at this point id send a text tell him its over youre done tell him to get some help,Mentalcomposer
then block him everywhere,Mentalcomposer
and all those friends who hate you now once you block him you can give them a heads up that its their turn to take care of him you know since they care so much then block them too you dont need these people in your life id rather have no friends,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its not your parents event idc who is paying for it,Mentalcomposer
your fsil said pants or a dress so you can wear the pantsuit and i dont know you but a pantsuit will look great on you,Mentalcomposer
go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil,Mentalcomposer
i have found that once i really get to know a potential romantic partner their attractiveness or lack of becomes a non issue like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become sort of better looking in my eyes if that makes any sense  i know this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list but that one trait just isnt a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when im with this person,Mentalcomposer
but if youre talking about do i have to find my partner attractive all day every day  no we all go thru periods when were not looking our best did we gain weight happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look did we radically change the clothes we wear cause were in a weird fashion phase,Mentalcomposer
those types of things come and go,Mentalcomposer
take a good look at your partner when theyre all slack and sleeping probably not the best look but that is them in a raw sort of way,Mentalcomposer
im thinking it wasnt malicious more so that the two of you you and sil are the babys main caregivers,Mentalcomposer
not great wording by mil,Mentalcomposer
i love my mil but i would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like  wait im the mom i did the labor and have the body to prove it or said to sil  ok you get her when she wont stop crying since were sharing anyway,Mentalcomposer
i cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together,Mentalcomposer
are you gonna get a fathers day gift too,Mentalcomposer
honestly i usually dont  care if the story itself is a bit disjointed ill see if it evens out or ill even reread a sentence that sounds odd to figure out what theyre trying to say but spelling errors are a non starter for me,Mentalcomposer
a random one here or there ok,Mentalcomposer
constantly nope i just stop reading,Mentalcomposer
you want to be a writer ffs learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors,Mentalcomposer
i want to know why you want to do this,Mentalcomposer
are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed,Mentalcomposer
there is absolutely no good reason for you to do this,Mentalcomposer
are you making up for lost time do you think itll make you a grown up what,Mentalcomposer
this just seems like a weird ritual to start,Mentalcomposer
this is what i would and have told my daughter,Mentalcomposer
he can be frustrated and rant and rave  about that thing but he has absolutely no right to take it out on you,Mentalcomposer
get up and leave,Mentalcomposer
you do not sit there and take it,Mentalcomposer
you need to draw a line with him tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way,Mentalcomposer
this is your first bf know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not and this is not one saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you,Mentalcomposer
there are other guys out there,Mentalcomposer
oh yes i watch a lot of news programs,Mentalcomposer
the one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone usually politicians are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else usually the other party,Mentalcomposer
so ok we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else tell me what you propose as a solution,Mentalcomposer
id rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea,Mentalcomposer
just give her back the money for her ticket and take someone else,Mentalcomposer
wow had no idea about any of that so thank you,Mentalcomposer
id be up for building a bigger building,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to have a high credit line but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency,Mentalcomposer
it might be helpful to call before hand and ask if thats something they could do in the event of an emergency maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay,Mentalcomposer
my policy is a pay now and get reimbursed so if i have to go to the ships doctor i pay and then submit for reimbursement,Mentalcomposer
but for example medical evac i call the insurance and they make the arrangements im not expected to lay out half a million for that,Mentalcomposer
what form of govt do we move towards,Mentalcomposer
correct me if im wrong but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution so in order to change it to something else wed have to effectively dismantle the constitution,Mentalcomposer
keep the good parts and change the bad parts,Mentalcomposer
that will never happen,Mentalcomposer
our system should work there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up,Mentalcomposer
but individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good,Mentalcomposer
im certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong and i suspect its been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today,Mentalcomposer
but it would be an interesting discussion,Mentalcomposer
from what i read and see middletown township has a really great special needs program like people move here just for that,Mentalcomposer
the problem is there arent a lot of rentals around and home prices are high,Mentalcomposer
id suggest getting a list of school districts checking out col see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs  dont know if its published but then join the facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there,Mentalcomposer
ive seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
i think i remember it being this way,Mentalcomposer
hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the nh,Mentalcomposer
but the caveat was that the nh was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others,Mentalcomposer
if youve ever visited a nh youd realize that this is impossible to do,Mentalcomposer
besides there being no empty rooms usually each resident has an assigned room and as is the case with older residents they know where they belong,Mentalcomposer
suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident will not go over well and vice versa  moving sick out of their room,Mentalcomposer
so i think nhs took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work or knowing they couldnt but were getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospitals burden or the nh only gets paid from medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didnt want to forgo that payment,Mentalcomposer
i have a relative in a nh and i will say there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness most of the residents dont even ever leave the home even just to be outside on the patio some more mobile residents can get themselves out there but most need assistance and the staff cant be bothered and there are never any windows opened luckily mine never caught covid during the major surge but we suspect she had it prior,Mentalcomposer
i get that she thinks shell get a payout but it comes up so often that kc will be the one who pays that it just gets on my last nerve,Mentalcomposer
again with kc paying her out,Mentalcomposer
i really dont understand what the rationale for this would be,Mentalcomposer
even if she has an nda shell never stop she will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out to get out another leaked letter to a friend anonymous friend source spilling info cryptic statements,Mentalcomposer
it is not kcs responsibility to get rid of her,Mentalcomposer
what could she really know at this point nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but harry and i have no problem if she drags him thru the mud its just karma coming back to him,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
personally moms attitude is crappy,Mentalcomposer
you are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people,Mentalcomposer
just make her lunch at home and be done with it,Mentalcomposer
shes taking this mothers day thing way too far considering she only has 1 kid who has a job,Mentalcomposer
shes never going to see your side of it she needs to be right more than she needs a relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom he needs to tell her if she has something to say to you she should say it to you not him and hes ending any conversation that goes that way,Mentalcomposer
shell either get in touch with you or not but your h being the go between at this point is ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter,Mentalcomposer
dont analyze someone you are not dating its exhausting,Mentalcomposer
move on,Mentalcomposer
nobody should have any patience for a constant on off relationship we either want to be together and resolve our issues or we go our separate ways,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you have two other kids in that house that you need to protect not that they need to know,Mentalcomposer
i say you have every right to ask,Mentalcomposer
hes living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life he should trust you enough with the information,Mentalcomposer
but dont say that and just accept if he wont share his diagnosis,Mentalcomposer
tablecloths because i hate to see the fold marks when its on the table,Mentalcomposer
nta for keeping the letters i would have also,Mentalcomposer
do you forgive him the problem with lying is that once they lie you dont know what if anything else is true,Mentalcomposer
only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not,Mentalcomposer
what did he say about all of this why lie about having a gf whyd he keep the letters what did she mean to him,Mentalcomposer
i have an idea about why he lied but id like to know what he said,Mentalcomposer
so im a lot behind on this whole story so if someone could explain please,Mentalcomposer
phone hacking i agree would be something to sue over,Mentalcomposer
but paying for a pi to get info any him or anyone else just seems to me like its a normal course of events,Mentalcomposer
so for example if im a tabloid or even just a newspaper how else could i report on a celebs activities if i didnt know where they would be seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course,Mentalcomposer
also the suspicious phone calls what made them suspicious were they hang ups were they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party ceremony etc,Mentalcomposer
sorry but other than the hacking is hiring a pi even if its to follow someone illegal,Mentalcomposer
walk the strip and go into each casino hotel its fun to see the diff theming,Mentalcomposer
nta for trying,Mentalcomposer
but i dont think its going to do any good,Mentalcomposer
you can try to occupy him when its usually  her days but shell just change up her schedule,Mentalcomposer
the fact that he proposed a poly says that he isnt willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue why hasnt he if he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isnt he putting your marriage first,Mentalcomposer
what did he say when you said no to a poly situation,Mentalcomposer
she sounds a bit unhinged youre getting in the way of  true love and  its gods will,Mentalcomposer
does he not think these missives are a problem,Mentalcomposer
he may well be miserable in the gloomy grey cold winter time its a thing,Mentalcomposer
but also some people dont need to see their so every day,Mentalcomposer
you guys see each other at work so theres no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also,Mentalcomposer
when do you see your friends do laundry grocery shop,Mentalcomposer
pick one week night and make that your night wed is good its right in the middle then you can decide if and what youre going to do on the weekend,Mentalcomposer
hes telling you its too much not that he never wants to see you again give him space,Mentalcomposer
so basically you just dont want him to show up on mothers day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like youve always done because you had a fight and are,Mentalcomposer
still not talking,Mentalcomposer
if you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets in touch on monday what are you going to do,Mentalcomposer
it seems like youre trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone,Mentalcomposer
as for the picture chances are his d is putting hers in front of yours find another spot,Mentalcomposer
you dont want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year fine but has that situation been resolved at all if not why would you ever entertain mothers day with his mom,Mentalcomposer
no key did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot of passive aggressive going on here,Mentalcomposer
speak up use your words,Mentalcomposer
look its been 9 years it either works or it doesnt and it seems like it doesnt work maybe it did for a time but realize this both your and his kids are seeing this and im sure its not the first time,Mentalcomposer
this is the way,Mentalcomposer
this is all what he thinks,Mentalcomposer
theres not one iota of what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched or that the non existent party happened or that h tucked anyone into bed that night,Mentalcomposer
so basically this is a non story,Mentalcomposer
its really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt but those  ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel,Mentalcomposer
why even give this guy any interviews have they not caught on that hes not reliable at this point,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
did they actually say that,Mentalcomposer
do they really expect you to never have another partner that you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives,Mentalcomposer
were not talking about children here who are still living home they should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone especially the 29 yo,Mentalcomposer
so if any of their marriages dont work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one,Mentalcomposer
your kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve,Mentalcomposer
and im over here pushing my step dad to move on and its been over 10 years since my mom passed i want him to have someone to share his life with why should he be alone,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your dad sure is,Mentalcomposer
the first person he should have told is his wife,Mentalcomposer
what does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first,Mentalcomposer
is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesnt have to,Mentalcomposer
he makes no sense at all  what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom do we all just pretend all is well,Mentalcomposer
mom might not see it coming  but shes been as unhappy as him she might welcome the divorce,Mentalcomposer
i need to know how this person knows their partner did the partner move to nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing,Mentalcomposer
if its online absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their child to go meet someone they have never met and i dont care which country it is,Mentalcomposer
but doubly if the country could be dangerous,Mentalcomposer
if its a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job then i might go but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country doubly if its a dangerous country,Mentalcomposer
come on this is basic common sense even if i didnt have a child why would i put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country,Mentalcomposer
i have no idea if nigeria is dangerous to travel to i got the sense that you think its dangerous,Mentalcomposer
yeah and we have no idea if thats really what he said ive seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers,Mentalcomposer
i dont trust any of them,Mentalcomposer
i do find it hard to believe that h would talk about either his fam or m in this way so freely with jack unless they have been in regular contact like was jack asking how are you and h went into a litany of complaints,Mentalcomposer
or has jack been privy to any ongoing crap with m or the fam that theyve previously spoke about,Mentalcomposer
i didnt think they had that kind of relationship if they do it would be the only secret either harkle ever kept,Mentalcomposer
does your h understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work  theres clearly a reason for this,Mentalcomposer
explain it to him again in plain english obviously his advanced degree isnt in english,Mentalcomposer
i will never be able to go back to my high paying job that i love that supports this family if i do not get myself mentally healthy in order to get healthy i need to rest and rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me and a responsible dad to our children the answer to this is that you take over being the support of this family as i have been for the past 10 years,Mentalcomposer
if you cannot do that then you are not the man i thought i married that man would be worried that i had an actual mental breakdown at work that man would be doing everything in his power to support me until i am better and able to resume my career if that is not you then tell me now and ill figure out what my next steps should be because i cannot go on like this,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i cannot understand your husbands attitude at all,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand why anyone would change majors just because they arent getting straight as,Mentalcomposer
that was the first mistake your kid made straight bs gets the same diploma as as,Mentalcomposer
so they changed majors to something they didnt even like thats the second mistake,Mentalcomposer
so now theyre miserable,Mentalcomposer
just let the kid quit this job if they keep getting bad reviews they wont have a job and they wont have a god recommendation either,Mentalcomposer
let them come home get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there,Mentalcomposer
this isnt a hard decision,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
first off quit whatever job you have your health is more important,Mentalcomposer
does your h at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child,Mentalcomposer
this is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job,Mentalcomposer
so what exactly does he think the solution should be,Mentalcomposer
too bad if its going to hurt her someone always is going to be upset in a breakup better her than you,Mentalcomposer
break up block her everywhere and move on youll be better for it,Mentalcomposer
no because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to volunteer,Mentalcomposer
you know like an actual act of service,Mentalcomposer
and not get paid for doing it,Mentalcomposer
oh the horror,Mentalcomposer
youre missing the point here,Mentalcomposer
establishing paternity is in your childs best interest,Mentalcomposer
if he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay that benefits your child,Mentalcomposer
but if you just want to keep going back and forth with him he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven,Mentalcomposer
split the cost of the test,Mentalcomposer
massive massive yta,Mentalcomposer
in the event this is actually true which i doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch,Mentalcomposer
what exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids,Mentalcomposer
your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids,Mentalcomposer
between you and your wife you dont even bathe and put the kids to bed,Mentalcomposer
how exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much  seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you dont do anything else,Mentalcomposer
you do realize he has a job and a life that doesnt revolve around your kids,Mentalcomposer
i really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night id love to see how that next morning goes,Mentalcomposer
so he asks if her robe is heavy whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable,Mentalcomposer
maybe it was something like its a small sacrifice for the family crownfamily or service is a huge weight to bare,Mentalcomposer
or she really dug in with something like  youd know if you stuck around,Mentalcomposer
no theres nothing to be embarrassed about,Mentalcomposer
this relationship isnt doing it for you anymore,Mentalcomposer
youre thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone but you can break up with someone for any or no reason,Mentalcomposer
dont stay with her or anyone you are not 100 invested in  its not fair to you or them,Mentalcomposer
found this,Mentalcomposer
he needs to see a dentist and a doctor,Mentalcomposer
its possible that at 18 this ldr satisfied your emotional needs and even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it,Mentalcomposer
it may be tho that at 20 it isnt satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity,Mentalcomposer
or youre just really bored with this girl it happens,Mentalcomposer
have you tried redirecting the conversation or has your wife,Mentalcomposer
do the other men also add to these little anecdotes,Mentalcomposer
sex conversations will and have come up occasionally but they are short lived and not every time were with friends  thats an odd topic to always come up,Mentalcomposer
maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share theyre trying to figure her out,Mentalcomposer
your issue is your frustration with your sex life not that your wife laughs along with the conversation,Mentalcomposer
its been 8 years you must have some idea what is holding your wife back is it something that can even be fixed with therapy if not all the therapy in the world will do no good,Mentalcomposer
maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist,Mentalcomposer
gf is tah for not deleting the pic as soon as asked especially bc they know op doesnt want them to have those type of pics,Mentalcomposer
and op is tah for physically restraining the gf  it should not have had to get to that point but gf did challenge op to come get it and they did,Mentalcomposer
so it seems as if your parents and his know each other  do they speak often,Mentalcomposer
i ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no they back down and you get your way,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip and maybe that would help his parents get on board,Mentalcomposer
i understand its cultural but you both have the same cultural norms yet your parents are being more tolerable,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
just the fact that she didnt delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me especially that youve already had this conversation,Mentalcomposer
today its a picture what is tomorrow boundary break going to be,Mentalcomposer
i,Mentalcomposer
have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things i specifically ask them not to,Mentalcomposer
ywbta if you say anything now,Mentalcomposer
this family is your uncles wifes  no,Mentalcomposer
why would these people even be invited to your wedding,Mentalcomposer
i can understand being close to an uncle and his wife but her family other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has you can absolutely not invite them,Mentalcomposer
plus youre no where close to even getting married so leave it for now,Mentalcomposer
i have no judgement because honestly i am not understanding this,Mentalcomposer
your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations,Mentalcomposer
were you supposed to draw or write one invite and then shed what make photocopies and send them out,Mentalcomposer
were you supposed to hand write all the invites,Mentalcomposer
is there a reason she didnt just order invitations,Mentalcomposer
i would think he would be invited with a plus 1 and that would be you,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt expect to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family,Mentalcomposer
you can always ask at least for his brother  wont you have to make arrangements with work,Mentalcomposer
yes i am in the hopeless phase right now im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase,Mentalcomposer
dont give up just yet,Mentalcomposer
youre doing well with breakfast and lunch its just dinner thats messing,Mentalcomposer
you up,Mentalcomposer
so maybe try telling your wife thats a problem shes going to have to be supportive of what youre trying to do or this wont work,Mentalcomposer
you can go out to eat but watch what you order have a salad before your meal chicken or fish and a veg,Mentalcomposer
then when your meal comes half everything in the plate only eat that and ask for a take away box thats tomorrows dinner box it up and be done have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wifes desert,Mentalcomposer
when youre going to eat at home youre going to have to plan for it,Mentalcomposer
grill up a bunch of chicken on sunday use that for a day or two add a salad or a veg,Mentalcomposer
its ok if you and wife dont eat the same things every night there were plenty of times i cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein,Mentalcomposer
i almost always snack on nuts in the evening if i just need something to nosh on i find they satisfy that need with a small portion,Mentalcomposer
youre doing so well all day long dont let the one evening meal mess it all up,Mentalcomposer
this was your tipping point,Mentalcomposer
not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did  nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked was that part of your plan you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too,Mentalcomposer
im gonna guess that he isnt making the same money you did and thats why you need to have such a tight budget but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings,Mentalcomposer
you had a plan but it had some holes in it im afraid this is going to be a very long year for you,Mentalcomposer
youve been stuck for several years coincidently youve been with the bf for several years,Mentalcomposer
is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and youre wanderlust is creeping back in,Mentalcomposer
you have been working so its not as if,Mentalcomposer
hes been supporting you not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach a lot of people just fall into a career find its pretty ok and stay with it,Mentalcomposer
no one can tell you what you should do with your life but you like traveling and have had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector  or work for an airline to get the travel benefits,Mentalcomposer
theres also online teaching english which might be better than in class,Mentalcomposer
i think theres some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas otherwise just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest you might get lucky and find something,Mentalcomposer
what has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasnt been able to find something he can stick with,Mentalcomposer
we all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings and a lot of us just cant be bothered but when it becomes an actual medical issue thats when it shocks us into action is he not actually scared about this health issue why not,Mentalcomposer
you have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues,Mentalcomposer
at 24 it would be a no from me,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a serious talk with your bf,Mentalcomposer
he wants to move and you dont have you discussed this at all have you told him why you want to stay your job daycare and family support,Mentalcomposer
what could he say to counter that,Mentalcomposer
you live together but are on and off how does that work when youre off does one of you stay somewhere else  or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place,Mentalcomposer
look this relationship doesnt sound very stable its good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all and i could absolutely understand that from his point of view,Mentalcomposer
have the tough conversations now nobody wants to have them but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are all that committed to the other,Mentalcomposer
once you figure that out a plan going forward will quickly emerge youll either both want to stay together and youll buy a house together or youll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support,Mentalcomposer
whichever way it goes at least youre both not in limbo,Mentalcomposer
thats the only way i like them firm and crunchy  or dried is really good too,Mentalcomposer
but i like all my fruit like that theres something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere,Mentalcomposer
we only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue,Mentalcomposer
during the game we just yell out the answers,Mentalcomposer
your art is stunning,Mentalcomposer
you are very talented,Mentalcomposer
so he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things,Mentalcomposer
has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim,Mentalcomposer
do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most,Mentalcomposer
id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day i will be finding a lawyer he needs to find a better way of communicating,Mentalcomposer
the old heshe loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me excuse,Mentalcomposer
no its weird and controlling,Mentalcomposer
5 pm for preschool yikes,Mentalcomposer
i still wouldnt do it its not your job,Mentalcomposer
and frankly you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor,Mentalcomposer
i cant believe the other teachers dont feel the exact same way,Mentalcomposer
this is an assistant problem they can figure it out id remove myself from the situation give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done,Mentalcomposer
if they cant get a sub one day then one of them does it you know because its their job,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
so greeting guests means what after church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them thanked them for coming and they have their congrats but this was both,Mentalcomposer
sets of parents then leading up to us,Mentalcomposer
if this is what youre doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests if greeting guests is a mob thing then id think its a fob thing also are your new inlaws in this receiving line also,Mentalcomposer
and its really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where youre getting ready im assuming your bridesmaids will be there also,Mentalcomposer
this one seems petty to me like theres not really a reason for it other than exclusion,Mentalcomposer
and lastly ive never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding but that could just be the norm where im from,Mentalcomposer
if your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him she doesnt have to talk but its the acknowledgement that they are together and shes a part of your life and his speech should reflect on that,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt do bus duty either if its not part of my job,Mentalcomposer
as a lead im sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home thats the stuff you do and assistants do the bus,Mentalcomposer
you have 4 assistants its their job so they can take an extra day each week,Mentalcomposer
i would just tell all of them not my job i get car sick and im not doing it they are free to do whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
what time does school end that you get back at 6 pm,Mentalcomposer
this is really odd to me tho where i live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus,Mentalcomposer
any change in how they see him is only gonna change  if they see him,Mentalcomposer
so if he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing up,Mentalcomposer
thats really all there is to it,Mentalcomposer
so now im curious does she print her signature on everything,Mentalcomposer
like im thinking a drivers license or bank acct application,Mentalcomposer
my youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive,Mentalcomposer
the ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head,Mentalcomposer
why is that are you not secure enough with your bf  how does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him,Mentalcomposer
but if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then thats perfectly ok also it may be your intuition telling you that this isnt a forever thing not that hes cheating or anything more a feeling of shes always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just dont want to deal with it,Mentalcomposer
and honestly it doesnt seem like youd be all that hurt if you do break up so maybe youre not as invested which is good,Mentalcomposer
ill tell you this tho if you decide to stay make sure you go to every family function make yourself seen shes thinking she intimidated you into not going and shes right treat her like shes any other of sisters friend,Mentalcomposer
thats not really an ultimatum tho he hasnt really given you any indication hes into you but you keep trying anyway why im sure hes a great guy but theres not much coming from him,Mentalcomposer
his indifference is telling you all you need to know,Mentalcomposer
hes not the last guy in the world find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time,Mentalcomposer
do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in then youll be here all sad because you chased and chased finally got him but it isnt the grand love affair you envisioned,Mentalcomposer
so its not really about having an independent life its all about having a partner,Mentalcomposer
well to attract a partner you need to be a good partner,Mentalcomposer
your mh is bad but you arent getting help for it,Mentalcomposer
you had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work,Mentalcomposer
take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be,Mentalcomposer
ask for help if you need but no one else can just give you a life you have to make one just like every other person,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
hes 6  hes not a man and you shouldnt be trying to teach him to be a man at his age,Mentalcomposer
honestly you sound terrible,Mentalcomposer
you can disagree with a book he reads or any other issue but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision,Mentalcomposer
she left over this even if its for a night shes got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be next time she may not come back,Mentalcomposer
i mean no offense but is there something about your autism that makes you not able to live independently and if you dont mind how old are you,Mentalcomposer
you need 2 things,Mentalcomposer
a job and an apartment,Mentalcomposer
do you have a job if yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can,Mentalcomposer
if no then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work,Mentalcomposer
if you cant find what youre looking for right now take any job the idea is to just start having an income,Mentalcomposer
after you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two,Mentalcomposer
then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income and well help you figure that out also,Mentalcomposer
i think you over reacted to this situation she was with her bf who i assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes,Mentalcomposer
i can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home but i rarely do because they tell me whats going on just like your d did  we just always had it since they were teens,Mentalcomposer
why would you check that she made it to work what if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park are you gonna go to the park and make sure shes ok,Mentalcomposer
leave her alone shes an adult and doesnt need you constantly on top of her,Mentalcomposer
tracking is for when they up and disappears and i can tell the police where the last location was but even then the cops can get more info than i can anyway,Mentalcomposer
its not just rich people who want more money its pretty much all people,Mentalcomposer
there are exceptions of course,Mentalcomposer
some people are very content with what they have and arent always looking for more,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
im just sitting here baffled that the h is actually complaining to his wife that he has to find a new job because wife told gfs husband about the affair,Mentalcomposer
like how is this even a regular conversation between them,Mentalcomposer
what should you do,Mentalcomposer
you turn to her and tell her,Mentalcomposer
cut the crap stop your crying like a baby because i saw an a on tv if you cannot get your insecurity under control this isnt gonna work go see someone if you need to ive been more than patient over the last 4 years but my patience is wearing thin and im tired of it now were here to have a good time and im not putting up with this you can go back home if youre going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally literally does not affect either one of us,Mentalcomposer
and then you stuck to that stop giving in to her,Mentalcomposer
this might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing ive ever read on reditt and we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site,Mentalcomposer
keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your family she isnt you and when faced with that choice i think a lot of people wouldnt,Mentalcomposer
so she cuts off her whole family and then what she has you and only you you cannot possibly no matter how hard you try replace a motherfather and siblings,Mentalcomposer
those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced,Mentalcomposer
take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded this was probably extremely hard for her to do,Mentalcomposer
life goes on and this too shall pass,Mentalcomposer
im sorry youre dealing with this,Mentalcomposer
you tell your parents what you told us here,Mentalcomposer
that theyre lovely people you love them and severing them from your life will be hard but if thats what they choose then youll abide by it,Mentalcomposer
but add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs,Mentalcomposer
you can add that you are absolutely positive in the fact that somewhere in their minds they know they have to know that being gay isnt a choice its the way whatever their deity is that they believe in has made you,Mentalcomposer
then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you,Mentalcomposer
please do yourself a favor and download a news app,Mentalcomposer
even if you dont read any full articles you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of whats going on in the world,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what exactly does she want an apology for your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time she offered to drop the kids off what more does dad and wife want,Mentalcomposer
has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad,Mentalcomposer
and why would she even want that,Mentalcomposer
because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it theres no way id want to see her this whole fight was her doing,Mentalcomposer
no way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then,Mentalcomposer
depending on the ages if the kids ask just say that grandpa is being a brat and hes in time out,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your first mistake was not having your own acct,Mentalcomposer
have a joint for bills  thats your 7030 a joint for savings  decide on an amount and each have their own,Mentalcomposer
ideally each of your paychecks should,Mentalcomposer
be deposited in your individual accts and each person transfers what they need to,Mentalcomposer
by you leaving your extra money in a joint acct you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct since she can access it but you cannot access her own acct,Mentalcomposer
how did you even agree to this,Mentalcomposer
i would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step,Mentalcomposer
dont look at the next big picture slowly work through the concepts one at a time until you have absolute command of that step then move to the next eventually the bigger picture makes sense,Mentalcomposer
abstract concepts are hard to understand is there really something to be learned in a sense if theres no definitive way of proving what the end is,Mentalcomposer
so maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts,Mentalcomposer
im not sure this applies to you and what youre studying tho,Mentalcomposer
just to be clear hes a male 32,Mentalcomposer
your post says 32f,Mentalcomposer
hes pushing way too hard i wouldnt even keep talking to him,Mentalcomposer
youre under no real pressure from your parents to get married  right now,Mentalcomposer
but it seems that he as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasnt found a match for himself is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met i suspect being pressured by his parents,Mentalcomposer
stick to what you want a marriage where you are in love that means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date,Mentalcomposer
dont shortchange yourself on this picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make it is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right,Mentalcomposer
move to the other place take the manager spot there hire a nanny,Mentalcomposer
i dont know why you think you cant raise your child by yourself millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have,Mentalcomposer
youre an adult but you dont seem to want to do a lot of adulting time to step up here,Mentalcomposer
leave him to his deal with his child,Mentalcomposer
hell probably end up hiring a nanny too,Mentalcomposer
he cheated with your sister is this a man you even want to be involved with  even if he didnt know it was your sister hes an older man with a very young wife who still cheated on her what more is this guy looking for whatever it is he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage,Mentalcomposer
i usually try to explain how im understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is,Mentalcomposer
so id say so x does this and y does this so when x does its thing how does y know how to do their thing,Mentalcomposer
this way the other person is seeing where im getting confused and explain just that part of it so i can make the connection,Mentalcomposer
so instead of hearing the explanation that still doesnt make sense they explain just the part thats tripping me up,Mentalcomposer
and thats why neither of them should be running,Mentalcomposer
after the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old horrible candidates,Mentalcomposer
im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties,Mentalcomposer
someone new might just rise to the top,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
do you even like your mom,Mentalcomposer
she wanted one thing and even paid for it,Mentalcomposer
tell work you cant make it,Mentalcomposer
you should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off,Mentalcomposer
ill bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend you wouldnt forget about those plans you wouldnt cancel on those people,Mentalcomposer
but this is just your mom and you dont even like the event so she doesnt get the same priority,Mentalcomposer
i would absolutely rat out sil to the company,Mentalcomposer
this woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers which really could have been yours if she didnt lie,Mentalcomposer
as for your sister being mean to you,Mentalcomposer
think about this,Mentalcomposer
her wife doesnt help her with any bills even tho they should be partners,Mentalcomposer
she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil put all that snark  id bet on your sister your sister probably is not standing up to her wife so shes taking out her annoyance on you getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she cant get mad at wife,Mentalcomposer
id get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat is she even still happy with her wife what is really going on there,Mentalcomposer
with any luck sil will be gone and you can get your sister back,Mentalcomposer
this is not your fight,Mentalcomposer
dont use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse,Mentalcomposer
your kids have other aunts and uncles they wont be scarred for life if they dont see this one aunt as long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and thats why they dont talk no biggie happens to a lot of families,Mentalcomposer
your sil is finding it hard that in her mind she did everything right and just how the parents wanted got a great job and yet her sister gets all the praise  and praised for something sil probably doesnt think is such an accomplishment but thats whatever,Mentalcomposer
let your sil come around on her own time or not,Mentalcomposer
the new baby doesnt care if they meet auntie,Mentalcomposer
you cant afford decent groceries but theres money for weed,Mentalcomposer
priorities man if you cant afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away  thats weed cable eating out etc,Mentalcomposer
if she doesnt like it she can get a job and pay for those things,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
why would you clean more than once without being paid,Mentalcomposer
its 45 hours that youre over there,Mentalcomposer
after 1 or 2 times she could have told him,Mentalcomposer
at this point shes using you shes using your labor to fund her vacation,Mentalcomposer
gtfoh,Mentalcomposer
please stop cleaning for her if shes so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt,Mentalcomposer
id youre at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if she wants to give you an idea of what she likes if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and youll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own,Mentalcomposer
the proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how,Mentalcomposer
its a phone call he has the time,Mentalcomposer
this is important to you you need to see him supporting you in this,Mentalcomposer
tell him that,Mentalcomposer
since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line he should call her,Mentalcomposer
and if your mom thinks shes out of line she should also call,Mentalcomposer
let them tell the teacher that your behavior isnt out of line or worrisome and that he doesnt appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or hell be speaking with the admin of the school,Mentalcomposer
the very first time a partner hits me is the last time i would ever see them idc if its a man or woman doing the hitting,Mentalcomposer
it will not stop it will get worse,Mentalcomposer
get out now why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when youre having an argument,Mentalcomposer
i want to know what she says the reason is that she wont get a job,Mentalcomposer
does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income,Mentalcomposer
id also stop buying her any special food wine and nicotine im not saying not to buy vegetarian food just not any specialty stuff,Mentalcomposer
that is not your responsibility,Mentalcomposer
honestly youve only been married 2 years id cut my losses split up and let her make her own way she is not adding anything to your life at this point,Mentalcomposer
i thought the same thing,Mentalcomposer
like what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue why m of all the women out there it makes no sense,Mentalcomposer
the absolute only way id believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model spokesperson for the line and since it is dm  based in the uk they asked about m to somehow tie the article to the uk through h the prince,Mentalcomposer
and then of course flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the m question was asked first,Mentalcomposer
of course tw takes this as a win that a rockefeller even knows who she is,Mentalcomposer
she should have answered with  who,Mentalcomposer
how long are you together  and how old are you all,Mentalcomposer
if its not very long maybe he just doesnt think its that big of a deal its a lot to meet the whole fam at once,Mentalcomposer
so going to the baby birthday is his out,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as youre thinking it is this girl is with the father of her child i doubt shes looking to make moves on your bf,Mentalcomposer
your friend has im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears,Mentalcomposer
there arent some magical words that are going to make her see the light now,Mentalcomposer
so julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it but if she needs help getting away shell be there for her and have julie start saving money for that plane ticket,Mentalcomposer
what kind of guy doesnt know how to cook a hamburger or a steak,Mentalcomposer
grilled chicken is stupid easy how about a salad,Mentalcomposer
i refuse to believe he only knows how to cook those three things,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt order out just because of the expense but when its your day to cook make enough extra just for you to have it the next night,Mentalcomposer
or take a sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again,Mentalcomposer
oh no youve misunderstood his concern,Mentalcomposer
worrying about security to the spare means hes really worried that hell be swept for recording devices and  or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line,Mentalcomposer
he has no fear for his personal safety he knows no one cares enough to do him harm,Mentalcomposer
so what at least hell have something to eat at home,Mentalcomposer
and she shouldnt be as stressed if shes working so she wont stress eat,Mentalcomposer
ill repeat what others have said,Mentalcomposer
do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse,Mentalcomposer
your gf wants to buy a house get engaged and have a wedding all within the next few years oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips,Mentalcomposer
and youre supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors,Mentalcomposer
must be nice to be her,Mentalcomposer
you need to decide what you want what is your priority,Mentalcomposer
is it a house then you buy it on your own if its getting engaged and marrying then you buy a ring and ask if its travel then you plan that,Mentalcomposer
but you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going to make you rethink being with her this isnt the way partners go about things,Mentalcomposer
see how she responds but if she is reluctant then you know shes looking at what she can get out of it not so much looking toward a life together,Mentalcomposer
there will be other perfect houses skip this one,Mentalcomposer
well they shouldnt have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors as it relates to m,Mentalcomposer
its a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that,Mentalcomposer
just let it go not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted,Mentalcomposer
that was the problem they wanted so badly to make it look as if m was this perfect person that wasnt real then and it isnt real now,Mentalcomposer
i like the idea that both of you on your journeys together great thought he wont feel so alone then,Mentalcomposer
youve got this one step at a time and you and him will get there,Mentalcomposer
ok so nta for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother,Mentalcomposer
your parents tho total ahs they cannot just decide they are done being parents   that aside,Mentalcomposer
you dont say what mental capacity your bro has so,Mentalcomposer
you need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it  but its going to mean he has to work at it no one else can do it for him he is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him thats where he should be the idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible,Mentalcomposer
mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past contact them get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are autism is a huge range but he at the very least will need mh therapy,Mentalcomposer
after that he may need some basic vocation training so he can get a basic job,Mentalcomposer
best of luck its not easy youll be overwhelmed at first but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off,Mentalcomposer
im so glad im not the  only one who found the idea of him peeing too  loud to be bizarre,Mentalcomposer
couldnt really care about any of the rest of it i was just stuck on that,Mentalcomposer
no not just anyone can go vote,Mentalcomposer
you have to register to vote,Mentalcomposer
then you get  or at least i did but it was lots of years ago a voter registration card in the mail,Mentalcomposer
depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote you can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll  the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot,Mentalcomposer
so when you go to vote you give them your name they look you up in a book you sign the book  and they are supposed to make sure your signature matches what you signed when you first registered and then you can vote,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
i need to know how old your brother is,Mentalcomposer
so sit by your dad even if hes not conscious  idk his state and just talk say whatever comes to mind ramble,Mentalcomposer
he will hear you and youll have no regrets you will have told him everything you havent been able to say in the past,Mentalcomposer
hugs to you,Mentalcomposer
from your comment i think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave,Mentalcomposer
if you felt threatened its completely diff than if you were just done fighting he wouldnt stop and wanted to just get some space,Mentalcomposer
in any case hes just embarrassed and even if some of your friends have reached out he thinks others will hold this incident against him so you tell him he either comes on thursday or he doesnt but he cant be sad if you go seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesnt look like the bad guy,Mentalcomposer
also i feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to thats what theyre for its ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends,Mentalcomposer
we all do it and dont hold it over the partner its a way to get an objective opinion on whats going on,Mentalcomposer
very sorry for what youre going through,Mentalcomposer
i think the answer is very different for everyone,Mentalcomposer
it will depend on what you already know so for instance was your dad military and never talked about it do you want to know that,Mentalcomposer
did dad have a first wife and youre curious why is he fighting with,Mentalcomposer
or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes are you doing ok do they like your partner or kids,Mentalcomposer
maybe you want to make amends over an issue,Mentalcomposer
figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations,Mentalcomposer
maybe your dad should tell your sister that,Mentalcomposer
not that i think it would do any good,Mentalcomposer
she knew it was wrong and thats why she never said anything to anyone even if she was having a reveal youd think shed have spoken to your mom about names even just in passing conversation,Mentalcomposer
look you need to have a talk with pam,Mentalcomposer
explain to her that you actually love this guy and even tho you married  im not even sure why for a lark a joke just for the trope of a vegas marriage that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy,Mentalcomposer
but let her know you arent going to divorce just because shes not happy you two are together,Mentalcomposer
ask why she is so upset is it because its her friend or did she want him or what because she seems to be upset for no actual reason something else is going on with her,Mentalcomposer
during peri i had bleeding that lasted weeks also,Mentalcomposer
that was pretty much my only symptom but it lasted years on and off,Mentalcomposer
my doc prescribed micronized  i think thats it progesterone it stopped it,Mentalcomposer
then normal periods for a while and when it didnt stop i was able to just call her and shed call in another rx,Mentalcomposer
maybe ask if that might work for you,Mentalcomposer
i think youre in the wrong subreddit,Mentalcomposer
but i found this and its from jan of this year so its up to date,Mentalcomposer
i am not familiar with the diff between a lpr and a green card but you may be,Mentalcomposer
also found this,Mentalcomposer
i dont want c to pony up one red cent,Mentalcomposer
this is harrys burden to bear she can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers,Mentalcomposer
and he can fight for custody on his own if he gets full or half or visitation or none oh well he had those kids with her,Mentalcomposer
c doesnt have to worry about those kids being in the los it is practically guaranteed they are never going to be anywhere near taking the throne,Mentalcomposer
and if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets so be it he deserves everything he gets,Mentalcomposer
is this her first year in school maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it,Mentalcomposer
how long are you together  maybe shes just over this relationship,Mentalcomposer
but the insults yeah id let her know she can think youre joke isnt funny but she cant insult you,Mentalcomposer
but by your own admission youre,Mentalcomposer
clingy she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel its too much youre both adults you should be ok without constant contact all day long,Mentalcomposer
talk to her tell her you feel shes pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what shes thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with your bf  even if this person likes you they did nothing odd or creepy to you so why does he care,Mentalcomposer
i would tell the person what bf did and that it wasnt you tho just to clear up the situation so this person doesnt go on thinking you like them,Mentalcomposer
go ahead and end this,Mentalcomposer
these games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does,Mentalcomposer
mainly because my whole family is here,Mentalcomposer
parents are getting older my kids are here and i would never leave them,Mentalcomposer
i dont want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency,Mentalcomposer
plus my life here is good,Mentalcomposer
slight yta,Mentalcomposer
why is the bf not going to be in school if they would both be home all day then no i wouldnt let her,Mentalcomposer
i would have told her she can stay home on friday and have a nice 3 day weekend,Mentalcomposer
please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day so do kids,Mentalcomposer
my kids were always allowed to stay home just because because sometimes they just need a break especially by hs it can be mentally draining,Mentalcomposer
seriously its a month 30 measly days,Mentalcomposer
you are not in love you are not sexually satisfied and you dont want to wait so do what any one would,Mentalcomposer
break up and find someone whos not a virgin and date them,Mentalcomposer
amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter if one of you is home for him now  this marriage may not last thats the problem,Mentalcomposer
how old are you guys she seems immature,Mentalcomposer
your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants either her marriage or affirmation from others  because she cannot have both,Mentalcomposer
put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife,Mentalcomposer
shes still talking to this guy which means shes getting something from him that she isnt fri you and thats not necessarily your fault no one can be absolutely everything for another person,Mentalcomposer
the last few cruises i went on they lined up the boarding group we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by so be careful,Mentalcomposer
idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying,Mentalcomposer
and why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife anyone will do,Mentalcomposer
you are just way too naive to realize it,Mentalcomposer
hasnt he been in trouble previously,Mentalcomposer
how does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him,Mentalcomposer
i agree i hate the way it looks even tho i currently have this look haha,Mentalcomposer
i dont have very big roots showing but theyre there and i see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices,Mentalcomposer
brown to blonde isnt hard to upkeep but it has to be done very often and im due but i just got home from vacay so i scheduled it but its gonna be a few days,Mentalcomposer
also depending on what process i have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde so its not all flat blonde but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isnt as obvious,Mentalcomposer
youre only 25 theres no shame in living at home if not now then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can youre lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead why spend money unnecessarily,Mentalcomposer
your gf cares more about what your,Mentalcomposer
money can do for her,Mentalcomposer
she has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel but the thing is she cant afford to do that only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle,Mentalcomposer
id break up with her honestly but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer to your own and she doesnt she thinks youre boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and its only going to get worse as you make more money shell want bigger and better,Mentalcomposer
by your own chart it takes 95000 just to start up a daycare  less if the contingency and working capital is lower,Mentalcomposer
so lets say you magically find a benefactor for that money,Mentalcomposer
im not sure i understand how youre going to lower the cost even if its not for profit it needs to self sustain at some point,Mentalcomposer
being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good but it doesnt make up for the fact that running a business takes money,Mentalcomposer
you could run the tightest budget but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run,Mentalcomposer
teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries especially that pre school is in a sense a specialty,Mentalcomposer
i proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher so no excess bloat there,Mentalcomposer
and at a modest 45000 year for each of those positions were at 9000year per child,Mentalcomposer
ok so we take a loss for a year or two  weve only got about 40000 contingency and capital how long will that last,Mentalcomposer
we add in older kids for a smaller ratio and increased income thats another teacher but we have to get them to the center after school do we need a van or a bus,Mentalcomposer
maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee we still have to pay an adult for that,Mentalcomposer
we can ask for volunteers older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled they dont add to the payroll but they need to be bonded,Mentalcomposer
maybe you dont have your own building maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i feel like im missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work,Mentalcomposer
so i think your idea sounds great in theory,Mentalcomposer
but a quick search brought me to the,Mentalcomposer
staff child ratio for kids 2 124 is 1t for every 10 ks,Mentalcomposer
so lets assume a teacher salary of 45000year  conservatively,Mentalcomposer
that divides to 4500year per child just to pay for a teacher,Mentalcomposer
add to that  at least one administratorrent insurance supplies and idk what else,Mentalcomposer
lets say we pay the admin the same as the teacher so were looking at 9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses,Mentalcomposer
the average cost of daycare in nj is between 1012000 a year,Mentalcomposer
so based on these numbers i cant see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now,Mentalcomposer
and even if you dont take a salary to start at some point youre going to want or need to draw a salary,Mentalcomposer
now i dont know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs if so then maybe its doable,Mentalcomposer
you might be better off getting a home based daycare license and having less children while also incorporating a learning atmosphere,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success,Mentalcomposer
or youre just really fun at parties drunk or not and he just thinks youre drunk because you are such fun and hes too drunk to tell the difference,Mentalcomposer
i would be slightly insulted by someone saying that so go to the party have a few but dont get drunk and be your fun self,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
you havent actually explained why you dont want your h to take this job has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your h feels like he needs to work a lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family plus you mention insurance which if you dont have is kind of important,Mentalcomposer
how is his health now can he even handle this job,Mentalcomposer
why exactly do you not want him working is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all,Mentalcomposer
does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into savings every month its always better to have more savings than less,Mentalcomposer
you need to find out why he wants this job at this time if he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this if you need to you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business,Mentalcomposer
will it be hard while hes gone absolutely but supporting our partners is part of the deal he supported  i dont mean just monetarily you when you wanted to start your business,Mentalcomposer
ok i have to ask what exactly is he doing for work,Mentalcomposer
hes in an awful rush for someone,Mentalcomposer
who is a spender why is he in such a rush its been 6 years he can wait another 2  youre both still so young,Mentalcomposer
you say you have money saved for a house down payment i cant help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow has he saved any money since he dropped out of school,Mentalcomposer
sit down and reiterate to him that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job,Mentalcomposer
let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldnt,Mentalcomposer
im sure hes a great guy but think long and hard if you who from all youve said sets a goal and works towards them and achieves them while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims,Mentalcomposer
you need to see how comparable you two are when youre both out in the real world rent bills chores etc you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
who believes that youre a fool if you learn from your own mistakes,Mentalcomposer
isnt that the point make mistake learn from it dont do it again,Mentalcomposer
does she keep making the same mistake over and over again,Mentalcomposer
in this case her saying she knows shes right and youll continue it at another time just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
how has this conversation not come up in 3 years,Mentalcomposer
stop brow beating the poor kid,Mentalcomposer
his mother has told you how she feels maybe you should try listening to her it is quite possible that you arent as all knowing as you think you are,Mentalcomposer
i will say tho one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself,Mentalcomposer
they hear it and model it it almost becomes rote to say it  kind of like amen at church thats my experience anyway,Mentalcomposer
its 3 months youre not officially bfgf and hes asking telling strongly encouraging you to get rid of something youve had from your childhood  nope not happening,Mentalcomposer
adults are allowed to have comfort things him saying hes there to comfort you is weird to me like only he can do that for you,Mentalcomposer
you keep that bear forever and take him out when you need to,Mentalcomposer
you got this,Mentalcomposer
now hope hes a good kisser,Mentalcomposer
okay i can better see why you wouldnt want her there but she really wont be able to outshine you at your own wedding as long as she doesnt get the dance which is easily done,Mentalcomposer
what else could she do you let the photographer know to put her in her place you get the band to ignore her requests and you warn her shell be tossed if she gets out of hand,Mentalcomposer
if you might want things to get better then ask sis if shes be willing to go to therapy with you,Mentalcomposer
maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding,Mentalcomposer
or just dont invite her but that plays into her idea that you know shes better than you and thats why you dont want her there,Mentalcomposer
good luck dont stress too much you have a year to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
how about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home you can just flirtingly say something like  what no good night kiss,Mentalcomposer
it will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear but i guarantee you he will kiss you good night,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister,Mentalcomposer
i understand sm being nicer to sis but thats not her doing anything wrong she was a child at the time too so i can understand you not having anything to do with dad and sm but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her,Mentalcomposer
just so i understand tho you dont want her there because you think shes going to somehow have a fd dance with step dad at your wedding,Mentalcomposer
easily fixed you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let sd know what shes thinking and ask him to not dance with sis at all if he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life he should be willing to do that,Mentalcomposer
thats what i was talking about,Mentalcomposer
put that on your tik tok your insta anywhere you use social media,Mentalcomposer
and ill add the florida law has a rape exception also,Mentalcomposer
but it has to reported,Mentalcomposer
you may be toxic but that comment was not,Mentalcomposer
how about compiling a list of birth control resources,Mentalcomposer
put it on tik tok instagram twitter,Mentalcomposer
places younger  women might frequent,Mentalcomposer
and fb for the older women,Mentalcomposer
take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact,Mentalcomposer
and have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who cant afford it,Mentalcomposer
well the easy hard answer is to find a job in london and move there,Mentalcomposer
you have a roommate now so get one there,Mentalcomposer
or find a job in london and live in a suburb close enough to enjoy the city but less expensive,Mentalcomposer
what kind of engineer are you,Mentalcomposer
this is what i always thought also,Mentalcomposer
just let me get up and walk off then the rest can deal with getting their bags,Mentalcomposer
and while were revamping debark can we just board the plane by rows starting at the back please  ill even let first or business board before me theyre not the problem,Mentalcomposer
find a boy scout troop in your area,Mentalcomposer
they would be happy to have it,Mentalcomposer
they do lots of camping and might have kids that dont own gear,Mentalcomposer
elementary schools have cub scout troops but boy scout troops usually arent run through a school but if you,Mentalcomposer
can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a boy scout troop that they usually feed into,Mentalcomposer
tomatoes,Mentalcomposer
i could not stand the texture of the seeds,Mentalcomposer
even now i wont eat the seeds in the big tomatoes i cut them out but can handle the small cherry tomatoes,Mentalcomposer
i love the way he says itll never happen with you two because you arent going to have kids as if thats where he draws a line pretty convenient for a guy who doesnt want kids,Mentalcomposer
but what happens if he for whatever reason decides hes not sexually attractive to you,Mentalcomposer
or what if you get sick and cant have sex for a while  is it ok then for him to cheat because you know he just cant go without,Mentalcomposer
i feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating probably to your own detriment and it wont make a diff anyway,Mentalcomposer
im thinking hes already cheating when youre not there he cant possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month  gasp,Mentalcomposer
if i was you id slow this relationship way down if he wants to move to canada ok but hed be getting his own place,Mentalcomposer
but im not you so id get rid of this guy i want my partner to go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when hed cheat,Mentalcomposer
11 hours non stop to hawaii in economy this was the smallest seat ive ever been in,Mentalcomposer
i dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it,Mentalcomposer
im not a large person either,Mentalcomposer
made it 7 hours ok but the last 4 were really really tough,Mentalcomposer
and then had to do it again to get home,Mentalcomposer
the whole family agrees that well never do that again,Mentalcomposer
im not in texas but im not so sure there are specific parking lot laws,Mentalcomposer
drive slowly thru the lot i think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign,Mentalcomposer
yes please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car the lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs usually close to each of the stores entrances exits,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to stop as soon as you see a person but it really depends on how far away they are from you if theyre like 2 stores away you slow down and  or stop until they cross,Mentalcomposer
id wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past especially if theyre older or have children with them just so they feel safer,Mentalcomposer
better to be safer and drive slow or stop if youre not sure,Mentalcomposer
nta i would not apologize for any of it substance or tone,Mentalcomposer
your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay too bad if it upset him,Mentalcomposer
you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get out your mom said she needs a break from him so now she has it,Mentalcomposer
wouldnt the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person,Mentalcomposer
if one is just as is said naturally gifted in a sport should they be not allowed to participate because its not fair to the other participants,Mentalcomposer
their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call naturally gifted,Mentalcomposer
but with trans women athletes they have an unnatural advantage over women due to their genetic make up as being born as men,Mentalcomposer
hormones may counteract some of this but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass,Mentalcomposer
are we talking during a marriage or a dating situation,Mentalcomposer
why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who wont cheat,Mentalcomposer
if the cheating happened during a marriage i would say take some time for yourself dont be in any rush to get into another relationship treat it like a death you need time to grieve the loss and when you feel ready then you can get back out there,Mentalcomposer
if you were just dating this shouldnt be causing you so much angst that youd be averse to ever dating again,Mentalcomposer
this was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time,Mentalcomposer
millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on it happens we deal with it and get on with living its not the end of the world,Mentalcomposer
why are you letting him insult you,Mentalcomposer
this is a person who loves you id hate to see him when he doesnt like you,Mentalcomposer
i suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with,Mentalcomposer
you know this but you are doing just fine you can pay your bills support your kid and really can buy whatever you want if not right this minute but with some planning,Mentalcomposer
stop giving him money and do not move in with him ever you will be stuck paying for it by yourself,Mentalcomposer
after 7 years youre finally getting tired of this,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt have lasted 7 days,Mentalcomposer
be honest with yourself here he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior,Mentalcomposer
so you either put up with it or you break up hes way too insecure to have any middle ground,Mentalcomposer
first off dont change anything fundamentally you for anyone,Mentalcomposer
second you said youre studying for med school so use all this extra free time to do just that but get out at least for a bit every day take a walk study in a park coffee shop anywhere else than where you live,Mentalcomposer
third youre young but not a child you started dating as a kid tho idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so bad that he doesnt want to date anymore but it does not matter this breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way there will be others you will date and break up with use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner,Mentalcomposer
fourth get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side if you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand,Mentalcomposer
fifth stop studying so much,Mentalcomposer
there is a point where it doesnt actually help studying is for review not for learning the material,Mentalcomposer
this all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with,Mentalcomposer
yup me too,Mentalcomposer
they wanted to make it look like she was,Mentalcomposer
and harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way,Mentalcomposer
then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have,Mentalcomposer
plus your d was away and its a perfect time for some mom son bonding time,Mentalcomposer
your son is 13 hes going into some crazy years your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to ty about whats going on in his life and if that includes james even better,Mentalcomposer
they do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up,Mentalcomposer
i think theres no reason you should have known who was picking up ty since im guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs,Mentalcomposer
but if your wife is home why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month,Mentalcomposer
since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son i think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks  weeks,Mentalcomposer
i think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell ty together  honestly i think a good talk about what he says and where its said should be enough what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff but whatever,Mentalcomposer
but i also think you and wife should discuss that shes going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens and im not talking punishments im talking correcting bad behavior when its not even so bad so that it doesnt get bad,Mentalcomposer
this isnt 1950 where its wait until your father gets home,Mentalcomposer
because people now feel like every day has to be a good one a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times,Mentalcomposer
their lives have to be picture perfect their partner the perfect one the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing its all so superficial,Mentalcomposer
that is not reality a lot of long relationships are quite mundane but nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment but the mundane makes the special that much more,Mentalcomposer
add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car,Mentalcomposer
so people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying,Mentalcomposer
married 30 years since our 20s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows we just take what comes and deal with it,Mentalcomposer
you sit back and take stock of whats going on in your own life,Mentalcomposer
then you decide am i going to let my life be dictated by others or am i going to take matters in my own hands,Mentalcomposer
leave the emotion out of it no issue is ever solved by the heart you need to use your head,Mentalcomposer
in this instance you get mad,Mentalcomposer
id be thinking,Mentalcomposer
who the heck does this person think they are to treat me badly when ive done nothing to deserve it,Mentalcomposer
hes obviously up to no good im not gonna sit here and take it  im out he can do whatever he wants but im not sticking around and watching,Mentalcomposer
and then you say that loud and firm this isnt a discussion its a decision,Mentalcomposer
its your decision,Mentalcomposer
ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is,Mentalcomposer
do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way,Mentalcomposer
do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants,Mentalcomposer
why are you still entertaining being involved with him,Mentalcomposer
this is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion im gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to,Mentalcomposer
that in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that id cut contact with him he sees you as less than and you have allowed yourself to believe it,Mentalcomposer
tell him to take a hike find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect,Mentalcomposer
have you ever met this guy,Mentalcomposer
and by that i mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move,Mentalcomposer
you find std meds and you didnt ask what he was taking it for,Mentalcomposer
did he willingly tell you he was going for an std test  and you didnt ask him why he felt the need to,Mentalcomposer
and hes checking himself all night and again you didnt ask what he was looking for,Mentalcomposer
do you two even talk to each other,Mentalcomposer
yeah you know whats going on you guys have been together since youre teens its run its course,Mentalcomposer
ill be honest i would not continue dating him drugs are a hard no for me,Mentalcomposer
you say youre ok with coke at a party but really its never going to stay at just parties and hes already tried heroin after 2 months,Mentalcomposer
im more curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit did he just wake up one day and say hey think ill use coke today and see how it goes,Mentalcomposer
if hes addicted its really really hard to break the addiction he will relapse,Mentalcomposer
he will lie,Mentalcomposer
are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life the highs when hes clean and the very low lows when he relapses the in and out of rehab,Mentalcomposer
id tell him he has to do this on his own for himself when hes clean and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what,Mentalcomposer
you want to do,Mentalcomposer
good luck its hard to see someone you love struggle but its his struggle dont make it yours,Mentalcomposer
so the story i just read his lawyer argued he was mentally ill,Mentalcomposer
no mention of being autistic so that had no bearing on why he killed,Mentalcomposer
sorry i agree with the judge he should never see another day free,Mentalcomposer
he was 20 so even though technically a minor whatever law you mentioned shouldnt apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult,Mentalcomposer
whats to question,Mentalcomposer
youre a boy you are were attracted to this person who presents as a girl therefore you are straight,Mentalcomposer
now this person says theyre a boy but they still look like a girl so youre still attracted and still straight,Mentalcomposer
does this persons family know they think theyre a boy,Mentalcomposer
did you ask them if they think theyre a boy are they gay then since they presumably like you and youre also a boy,Mentalcomposer
still not going anywhere romantically just be friends,Mentalcomposer
ok i have to ask,Mentalcomposer
are you straight and thought you were dating a girl,Mentalcomposer
or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy,Mentalcomposer
if youre straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys,Mentalcomposer
if youre gay then you can date this person because they think theyre a boy  except for the fact that they look like a girl and you arent attracted to girls,Mentalcomposer
this is going nowhere romantically,Mentalcomposer
just be friends since you seem to get along so well then it wont matter if theyre a boy or girl,Mentalcomposer
how old are you two,Mentalcomposer
how is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough,Mentalcomposer
what did the two of you change,Mentalcomposer
has rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant otherwise its going to be a very awkward dinner,Mentalcomposer
but i think youre trying to do the right thing its up to rose to realize its what her d wants,Mentalcomposer
sorry but she knows the real reason she doesnt want to have sex and its not stress or low self esteem,Mentalcomposer
she would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years  and really a lot of people will use sex to combat stress,Mentalcomposer
if she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years then shes got  therapist level issues that she needs to address,Mentalcomposer
you two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this,Mentalcomposer
ill bet shes probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you because shed be afraid of losing you,Mentalcomposer
but you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty especially on this subject,Mentalcomposer
maybe just stop lying,Mentalcomposer
have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself,Mentalcomposer
if they turn out to be bad so be it but at least you did it and learned from it,Mentalcomposer
and idk how your schools work but if you dont know history or geography how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate there has to be some minimum grade you have to get and if there is and youre making it just tell him that too,Mentalcomposer
your bmr might be off if youre using the same number from when you were 250 lbs,Mentalcomposer
recalculate it,Mentalcomposer
you do realize that your sole job is not to make him happy,Mentalcomposer
of course in a relationship each person makes the other happy but not from doing every whim the other has,Mentalcomposer
also you are your bfs first gf from what you wrote he didnt seem to have friends either and didnt leave the house much,Mentalcomposer
he didnt have the usual date around as a teen figure out all the dating rituals etc,Mentalcomposer
idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship,Mentalcomposer
that might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around and sleeping around plus most first relationships do not work out long term  but those are usually had as a teen which he didnt,Mentalcomposer
his idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you hell get to sleep with others,Mentalcomposer
and having 2 permanent gfs might be way of dating around hell have to navigate more than just one personality,Mentalcomposer
im probably reading too much into it  but thats the first thought that came to mind,Mentalcomposer
i agree its sad almost,Mentalcomposer
i buzz my ha hair and i told him when he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it,Mentalcomposer
but i would not just not say anything,Mentalcomposer
but who knows maybe hs happy with it,Mentalcomposer
while i absolutely agree it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan i suspect there was a lot more going on,Mentalcomposer
op says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so i suspect dad gave in to the car if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him,Mentalcomposer
and lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also its not just dad,Mentalcomposer
he put money away for college and cars its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college,Mentalcomposer
some kids are spenders and some are savers and no matter how much talking showing and giving advice they will not change until they are faces with the consequences,Mentalcomposer
son can still go to college he just doesnt have the option of any college he got admitted to his list shrinks due to money issues,Mentalcomposer
remember too that d is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford and the actual cost out of her savings,Mentalcomposer
yta massive,Mentalcomposer
come on dad as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife double that for your son,Mentalcomposer
he is losing his mother  the one person who has always always been there for him,Mentalcomposer
so instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up you get mad because he didnt clean his room,Mentalcomposer
really how important is his room right this minute,Mentalcomposer
give him a break,Mentalcomposer
and im sorry but i dont understand the significance of the hair if someone could explain please,Mentalcomposer
the minute he told you to delete a friend for any reason is the exact minute you should have broken up with him,Mentalcomposer
when are young people going to understand this  its irrational its jealousy and its controlling,Mentalcomposer
i say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man,Mentalcomposer
maybe ask your bf why if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there,Mentalcomposer
is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf was sb good to him at a time in bfs life when he needed someone was sb a mentor for bf something anything,Mentalcomposer
then i would take that into consideration also,Mentalcomposer
it just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isnt really seeing that and i wonder why,Mentalcomposer
bring back the hat and rename back to hollywood studios,Mentalcomposer
we still call it that anyway,Mentalcomposer
weve been going since 94 and dont even remember that hand sign i had to look it up to see what it looked like i dont like it,Mentalcomposer
then youre going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work,Mentalcomposer
maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now if she loses her job or quits will you be able to afford it  dont wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it,Mentalcomposer
at this point just swap rooms with her she can set up her school stuff in the br,Mentalcomposer
this way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can and if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also,Mentalcomposer
it seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day you wont be dealing with this every day,Mentalcomposer
her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her,Mentalcomposer
then shes all set,Mentalcomposer
honestly i would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed but only if i have already explained what the vibe of these parties are did you explain this to her if you did and she still made no effort that would be a big problem,Mentalcomposer
you didnt pressure him into not telling his family but you also only told him when you were 5 months along,Mentalcomposer
im sure he knew how could he not but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was im guessing all excited but you didnt share it with him did you share this news with anyone,Mentalcomposer
he didnt get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho what family traditions of his does he not agree with,Mentalcomposer
my dermo told me to just moisturize them like thats gonna help,Mentalcomposer
i remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for age spots i think it fades them,Mentalcomposer
im thinking of looking for something like that but i cannot remember that exact name tho,Mentalcomposer
i had to go back to make sure but,Mentalcomposer
you are 16  you have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person,Mentalcomposer
are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever  its not going to happen teen romances very rarely last,Mentalcomposer
your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff so ask out any girl who seems to be nice cute or have a same interest as you,Mentalcomposer
and stop worrying so much desperation is not attractive at all,Mentalcomposer
you dont think youre attracted to her so give it one more date,Mentalcomposer
dont discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company,Mentalcomposer
heres how i look at it as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any of these people especially if they dont even live anywhere near us i dont have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
there are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live that i really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen,Mentalcomposer
its basically harmless,Mentalcomposer
but thats just my personal feeling,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper or had any form of sm knows about it and talked about it,Mentalcomposer
we heard all about it talked about it speculated about it waited for all the details to finally come out and,Mentalcomposer
we got a list of people who flew in a plane,Mentalcomposer
virginia guiffree got her payday andrew is relegated to scum of the world je is dead and ghislaine is in jail,Mentalcomposer
what more is there to say,Mentalcomposer
no one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else  im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents,Mentalcomposer
sometimes relationships just run its course she was 17 when you started andnow shes an adult,Mentalcomposer
she wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched,Mentalcomposer
i think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home that alone would make me lose any feelings for this person,Mentalcomposer
so dont concentrate on what you lost concentrate on the fact that she didnt even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship and needing some time to decide if she still wants it,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt want you shell go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isnt greener dont be that guy block her on everything youre worth more than that,Mentalcomposer
wait,Mentalcomposer
the dad didnt want one,Mentalcomposer
what did the wife want,Mentalcomposer
cause the fact that her best friend wanted one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me,Mentalcomposer
maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path,Mentalcomposer
even if hes depressed he seems to be able to do the farm work he just starts much later than most farmers,Mentalcomposer
but if he got to sleep at a decent time he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus,Mentalcomposer
talk to him and his parents,Mentalcomposer
im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change and if theyre so overbearing i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand,Mentalcomposer
i dont think youre too involved you care about his family and only want whats best doe them,Mentalcomposer
i think youre trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done no,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case just waking him up isnt really going to help unless he stays up and does the work who is working his farm,Mentalcomposer
i think you need to have a serious talk with him,Mentalcomposer
if you guys were so close what happened when did fam dinners stop when did you stop working for him,Mentalcomposer
you said the behavior changed a year ago so what was it like prior to that,Mentalcomposer
and where are the kids mother does she not see them at all does she also just let them do whatever,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get his kids on a better schedule his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night what is he thinking by allowing this and his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting,Mentalcomposer
talk to him explain your concerns if you are as close as you say he might open up and explain whats going on with him,Mentalcomposer
is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm  do his parents not see what is going on,Mentalcomposer
why do you want to get past this,Mentalcomposer
hes been doing this stuff for 6 years what makes you think hes going to stop,Mentalcomposer
see heres the thing as i see it,Mentalcomposer
yes she cheated and that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce,Mentalcomposer
but you have to also realize that you werent a model partner to her either  you lost your job over drinking and im gonna assume when you drank you werent exactly a great husband to her,Mentalcomposer
now i am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am i excusing her cheating,Mentalcomposer
im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up at this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive forget or get over,Mentalcomposer
get some help for the drinking its no way to live and her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him thats not your problem any more,Mentalcomposer
thank you,Mentalcomposer
now i understand what ppl mean when they say it,Mentalcomposer
can i ask what they nickel and dime you for,Mentalcomposer
i hear the words im reading in my head but i actually read too fast and find i dont retain what i read sometimes,Mentalcomposer
so i have to purposely make myself read slower and if i dont understand what i read i read it very slowly out loud pausing to make sure im getting it,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho have you tried to purposely read faster what happens do you retain the info,Mentalcomposer
i love that you know that much history of your family,Mentalcomposer
have you been back to hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there,Mentalcomposer
those pics are so classic 50s america,Mentalcomposer
i dont necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped they have to be shipped somehow but id like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen,Mentalcomposer
an approved maybe regulated plan from outside the company preferably,Mentalcomposer
good job on the script that way nothing gets taken out of context and you say all that needs to be said,Mentalcomposer
and i never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes just saying its not the best in the long run for his problem,Mentalcomposer
ah big ones,Mentalcomposer
i searched quick but didnt find anything helpful,Mentalcomposer
so id say go to the er but id tell them they passed out the same day that way its an emergency and they have to treat,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i hope your relative will be ok,Mentalcomposer
while i agree you cannot make him go and get help i would have one more conversation about it,Mentalcomposer
frame it as this we have a child we need to make sure we are at our best for them if you wont get help for yourself at least do it for our child its not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day and its not healthy to self medicate with marijuana ive got nothing against it it just ultimately isnt going to solve his problem its just pushing it down the road,Mentalcomposer
tell him youll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes  id ask friends neighborsanyone for a recommendation and id call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him,Mentalcomposer
what kind of work up did the dr recommend,Mentalcomposer
i dont know about the er but id be surprised if they would do a work up there im assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs,Mentalcomposer
i found this tho,Mentalcomposer
specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen,Mentalcomposer
it seems they are free and will do a check up which usually involves lab work idk how the lab work would be billed tho maybe give them a call and ask explain what happened and what the dr said,Mentalcomposer
we need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to sign over the car,Mentalcomposer
depending on why the no contact im not so sure id sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie mae loan,Mentalcomposer
are you sure hes paying off his car you might get stuck with that too,Mentalcomposer
but i also agree i would never ever sign a blank document if youre going to sign it over id make sure to fill it out first you should know all then i do its asking for and take and keep a copy of the filled out form,Mentalcomposer
this is what i did and i am absolutely no expert by any stretch but this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started,Mentalcomposer
go here,Mentalcomposer
this will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight,Mentalcomposer
then subtract 25 of that amount and aim to eat that each day,Mentalcomposer
get a food scale to weigh everything,Mentalcomposer
then i just planned out what to eat for bl and dinner for the next 2 or 3 days i went shopping so i had everything i needed to stick with it,Mentalcomposer
i very rarely eat breakfast just coffee but i almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato olives carrot cucumber and a protein the protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna  in water i did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns,Mentalcomposer
dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken fish or beef and vegetables and a small salad lots of vegs,Mentalcomposer
and water was the only thing i drank lots and lots of water,Mentalcomposer
snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots,Mentalcomposer
have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack  or if you just wanted something,Mentalcomposer
it seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly,Mentalcomposer
but weigh everything  i even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my salad a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but i still counted it,Mentalcomposer
you can do this just dont try to be so militant crazy to start because you wont stick with it its ok to be over your calories when you start but you want to be over by 50 not 500,Mentalcomposer
i would cruise alone but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship,Mentalcomposer
go meet other solos these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt trust rooming with a random stranger,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused about justin,Mentalcomposer
hes not the babys dad we know that,Mentalcomposer
you met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be dad and you allowed that,Mentalcomposer
then you break up and he still wants to be dad even going as far as wanting to help with daycare,Mentalcomposer
have you even met this person have you ever lived in the same place,Mentalcomposer
all of this seems really really odd,Mentalcomposer
you broke up he wasnt in your life or your sons for all that long as a dad figure so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son,Mentalcomposer
now brian on the other hand do you,Mentalcomposer
know for a fact that he is the father,Mentalcomposer
because honestly it might be better for your son if hes not  the in out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough he doesnt support the child and you seem to be doing ok without him,Mentalcomposer
and now greg i would have him tested to see if hes actually your sons dad,Mentalcomposer
even if you dont want any support from him and even if he doesnt want anything to do with his child its better for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question,Mentalcomposer
if he is then you can cut brian out all together because really who needs the problems he comes with hes out of state has 2 other kids is in and out on a whim and doesnt pay any support,Mentalcomposer
in short,Mentalcomposer
find out who the father actually is then decide if you want to go for support and visitation,Mentalcomposer
dont have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son,Mentalcomposer
live your life raise your son and dont be so quick to want to have a daddy for him,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
show some respect for your grandfather and your grandmother,Mentalcomposer
is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about at this time,Mentalcomposer
everyones stressed on edge and its going to become about more than what it actually is,Mentalcomposer
this is not the time or place for you to make this about you your clothing choices over the years or what your family thinks about your choices,Mentalcomposer
either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them,Mentalcomposer
why are you even entertaining anything she says,Mentalcomposer
after telling her youre done this is not working for you anymore wish her well and hang up,Mentalcomposer
block her everywhere and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
she lives 4 hrs away from you its not like shes gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable,Mentalcomposer
its not really that hard,Mentalcomposer
this has been my fear forever,Mentalcomposer
also not just being uncovered but i could never even have my feet hang off the bed,Mentalcomposer
i do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers not even a sheet nope i need an actual comforter even in the summer,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
this is a lovely thing to do with your nieces,Mentalcomposer
and especially since its the younger ones first time it should be just the 4 of you,Mentalcomposer
this is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it,Mentalcomposer
im sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids they dont have to infringe on your day,Mentalcomposer
ok so wait im confused,Mentalcomposer
the general tip box welfare thing what exactly is this,Mentalcomposer
are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew,Mentalcomposer
ive read its room steward and the other positions that guests dont see like cooks laundry etc workers who dont normally interact with guests,Mentalcomposer
i always pay mine and give the steward extra but id like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut,Mentalcomposer
so if we dont pay it the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount  which they should anyway instead of being supplemented by guests,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case im taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel  to those people and of course tip the steward his cut plus my extra,Mentalcomposer
am i understanding this correctly,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
but he cannot always respond the way you want or need he doesnt know what you want him to do or what you need,Mentalcomposer
heres the thing tho,Mentalcomposer
youve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people not just him,Mentalcomposer
not to be mean but i would be very surprised if one of you if not both of you get to college and realize you dont want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day it could very well be you deciding theres someone else out there that youd like to get to know,Mentalcomposer
it happens and it should happen you both need to be free to grow and mature,Mentalcomposer
the summer before college is a weird time both of you are going to be anxious nervous about going away being on your own for the first time can you handle it will you find friends will you be able to keep up with classes etc,Mentalcomposer
so dont stress about hypothetical things when you have enough real things that will stress you out,Mentalcomposer
we went twice in one day and my h was that guy both times,Mentalcomposer
the rest of us loved it he was not amused,Mentalcomposer
nta for not giving a gift,Mentalcomposer
its costing you a lot to go and she did say its understandable so believe her,Mentalcomposer
before i say more tho what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food what exactly is everyone supposed to do during the party part of the wedding reception,Mentalcomposer
but theres a few things you say that come off as concerning,Mentalcomposer
why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later maybe they did it for tax purposes for religious reasons or just because they felt like it not your business,Mentalcomposer
your thought that she wont be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre they are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them,Mentalcomposer
not having alcohol at the wedding isnt odd at all really plenty of people make that choice,Mentalcomposer
im getting weird vibes as if youre taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow,Mentalcomposer
shes having her celebration before yours even tho youve been engaged longer she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable,Mentalcomposer
her wedding really has nothing to do with you your bf or anyone else,Mentalcomposer
you understandably said its costing you a lot to go and how its really stretching the budget but youve already got 2 weddings youre going to next year undoubtably your friends or fam and i can see how youd say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasnt really budgeted for but this is the family you are going to marry into so id stretch that budget go with a smile and dont burn bridges before youve even been accepted into the family,Mentalcomposer
and its not your place to fight your bfs family battles if hes always put last its up to him to fix it or not im still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho,Mentalcomposer
i think it comes from our education system,Mentalcomposer
most people graduate hs at 1718 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart,Mentalcomposer
so if youre married at 18 you have to be allowed to do all the adult things job mortgage kids etc,Mentalcomposer
and i agree with the other poster by 18 youve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not,Mentalcomposer
im going to assume youre still somewhat young,Mentalcomposer
ignoring him isnt the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up,Mentalcomposer
use your words you think he was joking but youre not sure so you ignore him for 15 min but then after that amount of time you what just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened,Mentalcomposer
then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place,Mentalcomposer
look if he says something and you arent sure if its an insult or a joke you have two ways to handle this,Mentalcomposer
might be a joke answer back with a joke  youre free to leave at any time theres the door and see what he says he probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping thats like the hundredth store weve been in etc,Mentalcomposer
you banter back and forth a few times and its over,Mentalcomposer
you think its insulting then you tell him  hey that hurt whats the problem and he explains the exact same thing as above hes just frustrated being in the mall,Mentalcomposer
learn now how to communicate it will save you tons of drama in the future,Mentalcomposer
think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the counter,Mentalcomposer
like literally sit down close your eyes and go back thru every single thing youve done,Mentalcomposer
check every outfit you wore every car you were in every couch you sat on every backpack or pocketbook you used,Mentalcomposer
were you studying at any time check in your books,Mentalcomposer
did you pack a carry on or travel bag check the outside pockets,Mentalcomposer
its only been 5 months why are you so desperate to keep this guy,Mentalcomposer
he treats you horribly and you keep going back for more,Mentalcomposer
block him everywhere stay single for a bit i think you need to feel better about yourself before you get involved with anyone,Mentalcomposer
check out ncl  i dont know anything about any other lines as i havent sailed them sorry,Mentalcomposer
they have a deal now that the second person flies free but all the sailings in oct are at least 9 days,Mentalcomposer
you can do a complete mock booking so youll see the total cost of the trip with the air included,Mentalcomposer
the least expensive cabin will be an inside,Mentalcomposer
i did a mock booking 9 day southampton but ending in lisbon,Mentalcomposer
inside cabin for 2 their free at sea promo  look it up if you dont know what that is with air round trip from chicago  picked a middle of the usa airport and transfers from airport to ship and ship back to airport,Mentalcomposer
total 379246,Mentalcomposer
do a lot of research understand what you are getting for that price look at the ship and decide if it has the amenities you would like,Mentalcomposer
booking air thru the cruise line means you get the cheapest flight they can get times might not be ideal i suggest paying for a 1 or 2 day deviation so youre in the uk early in case of flight delays,Mentalcomposer
check out costco travel also,Mentalcomposer
if you have a cc with miles see if you can use them for flights and then you can shop around for travel agent deals also  but if you book thru a 3 rd party travel agent just know that the cruise line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it,Mentalcomposer
i hope this helps,Mentalcomposer
i agree so much with this,Mentalcomposer
i dont like mexican food all that much but i have never even tried refried beans,Mentalcomposer
just the look of it never mind the smell makes me gag,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its pretty standard procedure which if hes a regular he would know,Mentalcomposer
anyway would it help if you mentioned it to the dr,Mentalcomposer
i would like to think the dr doesnt want him talking to his staff the way he did,Mentalcomposer
you dont say how long you are together,Mentalcomposer
in my opinion this is in no way cheating,Mentalcomposer
what happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness,Mentalcomposer
it happens whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt mean you dont find your bf attractive doesnt mean you dont like or love him,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt say a word to bf all that will do is start drama of you dont find me attractive you dont want to be with me you want him,Mentalcomposer
honestly its just not worth it,Mentalcomposer
are you bored that youre not fighting anymore cause this feels like youre looking for more things to fight about,Mentalcomposer
you guys are really young but if you are under the misguided idea that once you love someone you should never find any other person attractive youre going to find that is just not the case,Mentalcomposer
if you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive youre kidding yourself,Mentalcomposer
edit to add,Mentalcomposer
or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you didnt say anything even slightly upsetting,Mentalcomposer
the fact of the matter is that maddie is not your mothers d and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family,Mentalcomposer
maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru your dads family but they are not,Mentalcomposer
maddie is 17 she knows how this stuff works,Mentalcomposer
so you guys havent been together all that long,Mentalcomposer
is there any truth to him saying if it wasnt for the baby you wouldnt be together  or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him,Mentalcomposer
is his need to get rich now a new thing maybe hes stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family now with the baby on the way,Mentalcomposer
the thing is starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going when is he gonna have time to be a dad get to know his baby give you a break from work and parenthood,Mentalcomposer
your text was a bit rough but the basic message needed to be said,Mentalcomposer
you should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like,Mentalcomposer
be the bigger person and go talk to him get this settled or itll keep coming up again and again,Mentalcomposer
how long are you two together,Mentalcomposer
do they have a registry,Mentalcomposer
if i could afford it for sibs id go with something big car seat stroller high chair etc,Mentalcomposer
if i couldnt afford that or im a younger sib who doesnt work yet or still in school id get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies towels shampoo baby wash rubber ducky,Mentalcomposer
and diapers  theyll need lots of diapers,Mentalcomposer
but not newborn size go one or two sizes up everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick,Mentalcomposer
sorry this is gonna come off as slightly mean but what exactly are you bringing to the table,Mentalcomposer
you work when youre not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression you have no hobbies not that i think its a big deal but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring,Mentalcomposer
you dont like sex but are willing if the guy is successful enough frankly that is so gross because you seem to think its a transaction take me out buy me things and ill lay back and suffer while you do your thing,Mentalcomposer
yet youre looking for a guy who by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal,Mentalcomposer
ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you,Mentalcomposer
youre going about this all wrong,Mentalcomposer
relationships take time and you have to put in the time stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince one who melds into your life not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve,Mentalcomposer
build that lifestyle together,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
can i ask what you mean by you work when you get the motivation,Mentalcomposer
do you not work full time have your own business,Mentalcomposer
im not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes but ill give some ideas,Mentalcomposer
im assuming you have a washing machine,Mentalcomposer
you can try just adding regular laundry bleach to your wash,Mentalcomposer
for stains best thing ive found is oxyclean,Mentalcomposer
i wet the garment put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste let it be for a bit then launder it i add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent i use,Mentalcomposer
i have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean,Mentalcomposer
i try to get the oxy to dissolve add the garment leave overnight and then launder,Mentalcomposer
if you dont have a washing machine use your bathtub,Mentalcomposer
im very late to the party but with regards to him mentioning his age it may be that hes saying that if you have met he may not remember it,Mentalcomposer
i think based off your lor which he read this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you  was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student maybe he is just interested in your particular field maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field,Mentalcomposer
either way i think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study,Mentalcomposer
i had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work,Mentalcomposer
if you do end up meeting him can you update us please,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if shes your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years,Mentalcomposer
does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose,Mentalcomposer
shes literally being a bitch right now,Mentalcomposer
and the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you who the hell do these women think they are your pregnancy is none of their or anybody elses business,Mentalcomposer
they can all just fuck right off  i wouldnt even go and even better i wouldnt even tell her im not showing up,Mentalcomposer
what a wonderful thing to do,Mentalcomposer
im sure that boy was thrilled,Mentalcomposer
well done,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
has it occurred to your h that maybe his dad doesnt want to move,Mentalcomposer
its quite normal for fil to be sad and unhappy he just lost his lifelong spouse,Mentalcomposer
but it may be that being in their home brings him some amount of comfort,Mentalcomposer
it did for my mil and my stepdad,Mentalcomposer
your h and his dad just have to go through the grieving process it may take some time but they will get to where they are back to a new normal,Mentalcomposer
it takes time there is no rushing it,Mentalcomposer
your h doesnt want to hear it now but youre absolutely right his dad should not be making any major decisions this soon,Mentalcomposer
sorry but if mom has issues and the child who is still very young isnt in school and is spending 24 hrs with an unstable person then yes its much safer and better for the wellbeing of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs,Mentalcomposer
its not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself,Mentalcomposer
better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok,Mentalcomposer
if it is then great  everything goes back to the way it is,Mentalcomposer
but if its not then both mom and child get the help they need,Mentalcomposer
im not saying you should go but heres a thought,Mentalcomposer
you should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding what activities does he have to be there for if any,Mentalcomposer
have him ask the groom what the seating is like sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates youll meet the other plus ones who if youre not seated with your bf youll be with the other plus ones but youll have already met them,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine theres something wedding related every day for a week,Mentalcomposer
if theres a few days he needs to do wedding things then you visit your family if theres days hes free then you guys can explore the city together,Mentalcomposer
i only buy audiobooks for books that i have read,Mentalcomposer
i put them on when cleaning or driving or cooking or on a bluetooth when i shower,Mentalcomposer
its my background so i dont have to really listen so intently to get the story since i already know it if that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
if i listen to an audiobook that is new to me i wouldnt be able to do anything else because id have to pay attention to whats going on in the story,Mentalcomposer
if your d stayed home from may to dec did she even have any income that would require her to file income taxes,Mentalcomposer
call me crazy but if she didnt  pay any income tax because she didnt work and stayed home with her kid while also pregnant theres no way she can get a refund,Mentalcomposer
i think youre fine but id check to see what would happen if she also files and you both get audited what will you need to show to prove you and not her supported this child,Mentalcomposer
keep the refund you earned it,Mentalcomposer
i had read about this before so heres the answer,Mentalcomposer
i loved those blankets took one home with each child,Mentalcomposer
when you feel its the right time and the other person feels its the right time,Mentalcomposer
but please pay attention to what your kids think and say about this person,Mentalcomposer
if they have any apprehension at all about you pairing up or spending time with your partner take a step back and introduce very slowly,Mentalcomposer
in other words dont force your kids to accept this person it will never work in the long term,Mentalcomposer
trust me i know more about planning than i ever thought i would need to,Mentalcomposer
just some people find it off putting in the beginning until they realize how good it can be,Mentalcomposer
and youre right about dates when dating,Mentalcomposer
heres a thought it takes some planning but it might help,Mentalcomposer
pick a night youd be ok having sex when he comes home or even during the day let him know sex is on the table for early evening ill guess hed shower since thats his usual and while you finish getting dinner ready have him hang out in the kitchen with you or he cooks whoever does whatever,Mentalcomposer
he should since he knows whats coming be flirty and affectionate with you and since you need that romancing itll set the tone,Mentalcomposer
then by a decent hour you guys have your fun hes happy youre happy and then you can do your night routine and get to bed at a decent time to get enough sleep  and he can play his games while youre having a bath if he still want to play afterwards,Mentalcomposer
i get that planning sexy time seems idk weird strange but sometimes its just what needs to happen,Mentalcomposer
sorry but as someone who has a hard line at cheating he is totally justified in not wanting anything to do with you,Mentalcomposer
thats my one and done,Mentalcomposer
you lost this good one learn from that,Mentalcomposer
now figure out why you allow yourself to get so trashed when you go out he didnt get you smashed you allowed that to happen,Mentalcomposer
you met this guy for 1 month,Mentalcomposer
he went back home way across the planet,Mentalcomposer
did you really think hes going to want to be in an exclusive long distance texting relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
why would you even want that,Mentalcomposer
the smartest thing you did was cut him off for both of you now you can both find someone that you can have a real relationship with,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
not only a huge ah but youre insane to boot,Mentalcomposer
who the hell do you think you are asking your supposed friends to wake up early to practice hair and make up for your stupid wedding,Mentalcomposer
these are grown ass woman who i am sure know how to do their hair and make up,Mentalcomposer
they dont need to practice and they dont have to make any sacrifices for your wedding,Mentalcomposer
leave them alone or you wont have any friends,Mentalcomposer
no,Mentalcomposer
does hayley have any friends  it may be that she doesnt have anyone else to talk to vent to or ask advice of if not she needs to get out there and meet other woman or ideally other moms,Mentalcomposer
so she relies on the only people she knows,Mentalcomposer
does she even want to live in switzerland shes only been there less than a year no,Mentalcomposer
id maybe have a talk with her and explain that you and your mom cannot be the ones to solve her marriage problems,Mentalcomposer
its does no good to have the whole family involved in personal matters,Mentalcomposer
she needs to talk to her h about these things,Mentalcomposer
if she thinks its bad enough they can get some counseling be prepared with a counseling service because shell undoubtedly have no clue where to go,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt write her off just yet shes had a lot of changes in a short amount of time she might feel a bit like a fish out of water and shes floundering,Mentalcomposer
barely having arguments just isnt a good enough basis for moving so fast,Mentalcomposer
you barely know this woman it takes longer than 6 mo to really get to know someone  is her behavior in this instance a taste of whats to come  idk and neither do you,Mentalcomposer
add to that she made you cut out your best woman friend that alone tells me shes a lot more controlling than you are allowing yourself to admit,Mentalcomposer
look im just saying slow things down a lot,Mentalcomposer
you say you both came out of abusive and toxic relationships so i have to wonder if you would recognize a healthy one youre so used to a bad one those old familiar patterns may seem normal to you,Mentalcomposer
youve been together 6 mo and are already engaged,Mentalcomposer
she has a best male friend you have never met,Mentalcomposer
accused you of cheating after dinner and took a pic of your lips,Mentalcomposer
gave you the silent treatment and wont even look at you,Mentalcomposer
this isnt the happily ever after you think it is,Mentalcomposer
its going to take her a long time to undo whats been ingrained in her mindset for so long but good for her for getting help,Mentalcomposer
maybe you can ask the therapist if it would be ok for you to put some small decisions back on her but only if the therapist says its ok,Mentalcomposer
small ones like what other brand to buy have a code word or phrase when she calls and you can answer with something like  i trust you to make the decision there is no wrong choice so feel free to decide,Mentalcomposer
it validates her while also encouraging her to make these small decisions,Mentalcomposer
now of course youre not going to tell her if the brand or product or choice she made is wrong youre going to have to just go with it even if you dont like it thats a sure fire way to set her back,Mentalcomposer
she will see that she doesnt have to defer to you for everything and there are no adverse consequences to that,Mentalcomposer
the problem with hs mental health issues is that he hasnt actually had much legitimate help for it,Mentalcomposer
he went to a real therapist for a bit anybody know why he stopped,Mentalcomposer
but after that he went on a crusade of trying to heal himself through some very unconventional means,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt want to actually get better  he thinks hes perfectly healthy he has it all figured out,Mentalcomposer
didnt he say something like  paraphrasing here he wanted the whole fam to get therapy so they could understand that they are the problem they need to be made to see that they are the bad guys they treated his wife wrong they didnt protect them  whatever the f that means they drove them out of the fam they made it untenable for them to stay etc etc etc,Mentalcomposer
as if him and the witch werent culpable at all,Mentalcomposer
he is just so out of touch with reality,Mentalcomposer
she probably didnt remember any of it and her bf had to tell her how she acted,Mentalcomposer
shes mortified about her behavior and is probably avoiding having to talk to you especially after she read your text,Mentalcomposer
maybe give her another day or two and text her again just ask how shes doing and see if she answers you,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if the bf actually put her out,Mentalcomposer
i saw a woman win over 1 million on a wheel of fortune game in atlantic city,Mentalcomposer
she was seriously shocked she said she doesnt usually gamble had no idea what to do just hit max bet,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt hug when youre introduced just give a wave and say hi its not to meet you,Mentalcomposer
since you havent been around kids just think of them as small people,Mentalcomposer
you must have some idea what they like from their dad so ask about those,Mentalcomposer
and dont disparage anything they say you might not like snakes but the kid has a pet snake for example you dont say snakes are gross you say ive never been around a snake and you talk about feeding it and caring for it etc,Mentalcomposer
just be yourself dont be too quiet but dont take over the conversation either,Mentalcomposer
dont rush this is only step one slow and steady is the best way to go,Mentalcomposer
hawaii,Mentalcomposer
never had a huge interest in going but we did and it was beautiful,Mentalcomposer
lots to see and do or you can just enjoy the beach,Mentalcomposer
its also kind of expensive so a honeymoon splurge is justified,Mentalcomposer
were retired,Mentalcomposer
its only that organized out of necessity really,Mentalcomposer
a couple years ago they went off in the middle of the night of course no fire but we couldnt get them to stop so had to get the fire dept out,Mentalcomposer
after that my h started putting the install dates on them and this last episode we figured since the batteries were being changed might as well date them too,Mentalcomposer
and theyre only hard wired cause we had an addition put on years ago and had to bring it all up to code,Mentalcomposer
we change ours every daylight savings time but we did it about a month ago,Mentalcomposer
mine are hard wired and went off one night but it stopped and then went off again  not the beep the actual fire fire,Mentalcomposer
so after realizing theres no fire we set out to figure out which detector was faulty,Mentalcomposer
in that process we changed every battery and a few of the older detectors,Mentalcomposer
of course the last one we had to check was the one that was faulty this detector was 10 years old  none of the other ones in the whole house were as old most were about 3 years old have no idea why we never changed out this one,Mentalcomposer
so now every detector has a date written on it when it was installed and every battery also has the date we replaced them,Mentalcomposer
oh and detectors usually only have a lifespan of 10 years,Mentalcomposer
seriously its been 2 years and shes still not over her ex,Mentalcomposer
its not like shes just pining away secretly shes  actively trying to meet up with him,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be her placeholder until this guy decides he wants her back and she dumps you,Mentalcomposer
im sure theres someone out there who actually wants to be with you cause this girl isnt it,Mentalcomposer
just to mention they could have had the cruise line book them up to two days prior to embark date ncl has that option,Mentalcomposer
of course that means they have to have more days off and pay for hotels and meals for those days so a lot of people cant do that or just dont want to,Mentalcomposer
personally i would never fly in on day of embark especially with an international flight its just too risky,Mentalcomposer
and travel insurance is great for this scenario but the dissapointment of missing my vacation needs to be taken into consideration also,Mentalcomposer
because it doesnt make any sense,Mentalcomposer
fed student loans were never going to cover the full cost of college,Mentalcomposer
the maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is 31000 divided over 4 years,Mentalcomposer
in the big picture this isnt a crippling amount people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back,Mentalcomposer
so the govt makes the loan the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest,Mentalcomposer
the act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them,Mentalcomposer
cancelling 10000 or 20000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself,Mentalcomposer
so that means the govt  essentially every taxpayer is paying for this relief,Mentalcomposer
i have a definite problem with continuing a program that  basically has no funding source other than more spending,Mentalcomposer
the govt is making loans to incoming freshman for sept of this year where is that money coming from,Mentalcomposer
so we cancel some amount now but what about graduates in 2024 and beyond do they get some relief too,Mentalcomposer
look i get the economy isnt great i have 3 kids that have this debt,Mentalcomposer
how about we ensure that students who took these loans satisfy their legal obligation they may have a few tough years as they begin their careers and life but it isnt like every other generation hasnt had mostly the same exact scenario,Mentalcomposer
of course some had it better at times but that is simply because of what was happening at the time and the economy and jobs and salaries all have ups and downs,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah youre fine then,Mentalcomposer
i thought it was a not seeing her ever thing,Mentalcomposer
but rethink the wedding mostly so your h doesnt have to go alone and he doesnt get all the qs about where you are from everyone unless he doesnt care then youre good,Mentalcomposer
im pretty sure shes the type that wont even notice youre there too busy being fawned over by her bridesmaids or yelling at the caterer,Mentalcomposer
while i agree she sounds unreasonableim trying to be nice,Mentalcomposer
the fact is that she is marrying into your husbands family,Mentalcomposer
which means whether you want to associate with her or not there are going to be times when you will be around her think holidays inlaw bdays children bdays family weddings not hers funerals etc,Mentalcomposer
so you have to decide how youre going to navigate all this without having the rest of the family get on your case for it,Mentalcomposer
the wedding you and h should go its his bro your parents should decline  idk why they would even want to go they babysit for you that night,Mentalcomposer
the shower you decline and just say youre working that weekend they dont need to know its on call or whatever,Mentalcomposer
any other occasions you go your inlaws are not going to take kindly to never seeing their son on a holiday because you dont like sil and maybe your h wants to spend some time with his parents,Mentalcomposer
you say hi and bye and be civil,Mentalcomposer
theres ways to navigate thru this,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the update,Mentalcomposer
amazing that they admit its their issue and still refused to refund,Mentalcomposer
good on you for going higher,Mentalcomposer
heres hoping the refund comes soon,Mentalcomposer
have a great trip,Mentalcomposer
so i found this recipe,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure its a bad meal as its 285 cal for a 4 oz serving of the beef,Mentalcomposer
just trim any remaining fat which i think youd do anyway,Mentalcomposer
but it has a very high salt content according to this,Mentalcomposer
the first recipe is how i cook mine,Mentalcomposer
just put it in a pot and boil i add the cabbage and potatoes pretty much after the beef is cooked because i dont like when they get really mushy,Mentalcomposer
i cook the vegs just until the potatoes are soft and the cabbage is cooked thru but slightly firm,Mentalcomposer
i cant help with spring break stuff but if you really have to go to key west rent a car,Mentalcomposer
miami to key west is a 4 hour drive,Mentalcomposer
and orlando to key west is a 6 hour drive,Mentalcomposer
idk where youre flying into,Mentalcomposer
absolutely agree with everything you wrote,Mentalcomposer
but i didnt mean to imply drop them at the club all day long it seems a lot of people thought thats what i meant,Mentalcomposer
so to expand on that,Mentalcomposer
just if the choice is roam free or kids club id opt kids club at least the first few days for a bit to have a chance to meet other kids,Mentalcomposer
and i said if he meets a buddy and wants to do something else have the boy set a time and him and buddy can go do that or those things,Mentalcomposer
and if he has a phone even better he can text where theyre gonna go next,Mentalcomposer
were done here going for ice cream or in the pool or wherever so at least the parents have an idea of where he is,Mentalcomposer
i think thats fair gives him a bit of free movement without mom or dad tagging along but hes with a buddy or two and can get small doses of roaming free  but somewhat controlled if that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
so just so im clear,Mentalcomposer
this is on government  or company issued devices,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case i dont have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
what am i missing if anything,Mentalcomposer
i know about china tracking and all that but theres got to be more to it since theres such a ruckus around it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
the main thing is that this is passed on through your moms family,Mentalcomposer
your dad and especially your half sis from him have zero connection to your moms side,Mentalcomposer
thats your out this is from moms side not dads,Mentalcomposer
tell her to have her grandparents write down their recipes she can have that,Mentalcomposer
youre not even close with this half sister so i have no idea why shed even care,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt let a 10 yo roam around alone,Mentalcomposer
the kids club is where he should be,Mentalcomposer
if he meets a friend in the club and they want to do something specific like go to the arcade do the ropes course etc then he needs to ask if he can do that at a specific time,Mentalcomposer
so maybe dont put him in the club at that time but they meet up where theyre gonna go to meet the friend and then they go off but id walk him to the meeting place and at least meet the other kid,Mentalcomposer
does he have a phone so he can at least tell you where he is like after the arcade were going for ice cream then were going wherever,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your wife is being a bad mother in regards to your sons health,Mentalcomposer
your wife just doesnt want to admit that your son is unwell,Mentalcomposer
so its up to you now to help your son,Mentalcomposer
go to your son and ask him what he wants to do he seems to relate better to you anyway,Mentalcomposer
is that therapy or meds not painkillers more along the lines of an anti depressant or does he just want a semester off to stay home get out in nature or just have no stress,Mentalcomposer
dont dictate what he should be doing,Mentalcomposer
he knows hes unwell he probably has some idea what he needs at this moment,Mentalcomposer
then facilitate doing what he wants to do for himself,Mentalcomposer
she was granted legal custody and the dad asked for no visitation,Mentalcomposer
but dad was ordered to pay support,Mentalcomposer
so ill guess the court didnt decide visitation because he said he didnt want it,Mentalcomposer
now he and his whole family suddenly wants to see the son,Mentalcomposer
i really hate that every time i hear of a dog attack i automatically think its a pit bull,Mentalcomposer
but it is always a pit bull,Mentalcomposer
i keep hearing that these dogs are really sweet when trained well but these dogs were bred to be vicious,Mentalcomposer
so even if its a well trained dog there can  be circumstances where the dog will revert back to its basic instinct of being vicious,Mentalcomposer
i dont know what circumstance this could be but it seems to happen,Mentalcomposer
anyone else just curious why exactly,Mentalcomposer
his parents need a,Mentalcomposer
no doing dangerous things in the house,Mentalcomposer
rule to begin with,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
stop doing dangerous things in your parents house or you wont have a house or parents to come home to,Mentalcomposer
why do you want to be married to someone who is not in love with you,Mentalcomposer
how can you look at him a guy who lied and cheated pretty much the whole time you are together and not be absolutely disgusted by what you see  that alone would make me lose any love i had for him,Mentalcomposer
dont sacrifice any more of your dignity and pride for a guy who will cheat andor move on from you when he finds something better in a heartbeat,Mentalcomposer
i am a parent although mine are out of school now,Mentalcomposer
i would not allow anyone associated with the school to touch my childs personal laptop,Mentalcomposer
if the school is so worried they can give my child a laptop that only allows access to approved sites for schoolwork only,Mentalcomposer
id ask your parents about this whole scenario,Mentalcomposer
totally agree,Mentalcomposer
shes pushing back school so she can go on vacation with money they dont have,Mentalcomposer
if they have extra money for a vacation that money should be used to pay down the debt,Mentalcomposer
its understandable now why they have such debt,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car or even worse that youd pay for her party,Mentalcomposer
they are her parents if they want her to have these things they can buy them,Mentalcomposer
if bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce,Mentalcomposer
this is your bros fight to fight i wouldnt do anything either he made this mess he can figure it out,Mentalcomposer
in the event mom is forced to get out then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it,Mentalcomposer
i really dont think i can take anymore of her truth,Mentalcomposer
now if she wants to admit to the truth i might listen,Mentalcomposer
but we know shed never do that it will make her look bad,Mentalcomposer
but do you realize that the  loan you paid off including the interest actually funded the next group of kids that need loans,Mentalcomposer
the fed govt only backed those loans so they had enough money to fund the next round of loans,Mentalcomposer
i have  kids that are all paying off their loans of course they stopped when it was on pause but i told all of them to make sure they didnt spend that amount of their budget for when they had to start repaying them,Mentalcomposer
oh and my h and i paid ours off too,Mentalcomposer
i agree i think first time employees need a bit of in office experience,Mentalcomposer
you def get a lay of the land that way,Mentalcomposer
you learn the in office politics and just a general how to behave in an office setting,Mentalcomposer
i like seeing them its kind of fun seeing usually older couples riding,Mentalcomposer
i always think the guy was a biker back i the day maybe and he had to give it up so this is the closest hell,Mentalcomposer
come to riding,Mentalcomposer
and he has his partner with him its nice,Mentalcomposer
oahu was absolutely gorgeous,Mentalcomposer
enjoy,Mentalcomposer
the med on a cruise italy greece turkey montenegro,Mentalcomposer
cannot wait,Mentalcomposer
spending a few days in rome then doing a trans atlantic back to fla,Mentalcomposer
its my longest vacation cannot wait,Mentalcomposer
just find a teenager in the neighborhood to watch your kids at your home while your wife works and ask your parents for the every other weekend or whatever their schedule can do,Mentalcomposer
paying might cut into the amount of money your wife is making but you dont really have a choice do you,Mentalcomposer
even if you get the kids in daycare is your wife really going to be making enough money to cover it,Mentalcomposer
if its just a matter of her wanting to work put the little one in daycare while the 5 yo is in school and she can work those hours,Mentalcomposer
your wife cannot be mad at your parents im sure it sounded good at the time but the reality was it was unsustainable long term for them,Mentalcomposer
and thats what you should have said at the time,Mentalcomposer
i also went to one store and found mine also only tried on a few,Mentalcomposer
but i had been looking thru brides magazine  do they still have that for months i kept coming back to the same one,Mentalcomposer
and it was the one and 33 years later i still love it,Mentalcomposer
nah this person will not care what anyone else has to say,Mentalcomposer
take what responses you have gotten here and decide for yourself what your next move should be,Mentalcomposer
this is your life dont leave it up to someone who belittles you,Mentalcomposer
look at what 5pinktoes has to say about the power imbalance she is spot on,Mentalcomposer
you have none if you stay,Mentalcomposer
all of this is really odd,Mentalcomposer
why does he even care how long it took you to find a dress  he should be thrilled now you wont be stressing that  youre never gonna find one that happens a lot,Mentalcomposer
for him to get mad over this is uncalled for,Mentalcomposer
does he frequently get mad over trivial things maybe that should be a conversation,Mentalcomposer
youre not being sensitive,Mentalcomposer
every one of those examples are meant to demean you the person saying them seems to have a very high opinion of themselves and you wont ever measure up to them,Mentalcomposer
this person will not change they will not understand how these words bother you  ever,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt put up with it,Mentalcomposer
slight yta,Mentalcomposer
i understand  that in your experience laying it out so bluntly has been the way to shut down any debate but i think you should have  and in the future should explain the reasoning once if a debate ensues or your explanation is questioned then you go nuclear,Mentalcomposer
in other words nice first then nuclear,Mentalcomposer
and hey dont stress its one day it will be wonderful even if not perfect,Mentalcomposer
nothing is ever perfect,Mentalcomposer
when you feel stressed take a step back calm yourself and then go back to it   one thing one decision at a time,Mentalcomposer
suppers done roast beef,Mentalcomposer
to let d know,Mentalcomposer
you were only dating the first girl for a little over a month so i do not think theres anything wrong with breaking up with her to start dating another,Mentalcomposer
thats the point of dating you date you break up when you find someone else you like better,Mentalcomposer
i would suggest not becoming exclusive with anyone until you date for longer than a month and get to know that person better as you found out you really didnt like the way the first girl treated you,Mentalcomposer
take your time with the new girl dont go all in until youve dated for a while and make sure she is someone you have an actual real connection with,Mentalcomposer
and really get a hold of your emotions you should not be upset because you may have caused someone to be sad its going to happen doesnt make you a bad person,Mentalcomposer
and frankly the first girl doesnt sound like such a nice person with the way she spoke to you,Mentalcomposer
any partner is going to at times say something you dont like but its in those times that you think about what caused them to say it reflect and ask yourself if its justified and fight the times it is not and admit when it is,Mentalcomposer
first off dont have the open relationship talk until you have exhausted every other possible solution  keep in mind even if she says ok she may not be and she will be home with your child while youre out with another woman which could then lead to a complete breakdown of your marriage,Mentalcomposer
tread very carefully here,Mentalcomposer
so its been 4 years and she hasnt given you any explanation,Mentalcomposer
explain to her that she can no longer put off having this conversation,Mentalcomposer
theres obviously something going on with her and you need to know what it is it is not fair to you or the relationship that shes not willing to discuss a fundamental issue that you feel you are having,Mentalcomposer
yes of course caring for the baby is important but not to the detriment of the marriage there needs to be a balance,Mentalcomposer
start there and see what she says and where the conversation goes,Mentalcomposer
did you ask why what did she say the reason is,Mentalcomposer
im surprised you stayed that long,Mentalcomposer
do you miss really her or do you just miss the idea of having someone in your life  your whole schedule is all changed up maybe you just need to get into a new normal,Mentalcomposer
humans need physical touch we need to feel intimacy with our partners it almost seems cruel to me that shed withhold cuddling and kissing,Mentalcomposer
does she think you really cannot control yourself thats insulting,Mentalcomposer
do i have it right that she just decided after 6 mo of dating to no longer have sex  because you were together 1 12 yrs but havent had sex in 1 yr,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
wear what you like and have her son tell his mom that shes crossing a line with trying to dictate what you both wear,Mentalcomposer
i liked showers better when the bride or mom to be had no idea and was surprised,Mentalcomposer
your mil would have had a stroke if she saw what i wore to mine,Mentalcomposer
i didnt even know it was my shower so it was leggings and a long sweater with sneakers,Mentalcomposer
i dont think so id think they arent really hot,Mentalcomposer
like this,Mentalcomposer
these are a bit pricey so id shop around,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
candles are dangerous and a 10 yo really cannot grasp the absolute seriousness of if something goes wrong,Mentalcomposer
anyway buy her a few of the battery operated tea lights that she can place in nice holders,Mentalcomposer
shell get the effect of candles with no risk,Mentalcomposer
you know what tho its a big bday you only turn 40 once youre already splurging for the haven,Mentalcomposer
go for it  make this trip your ultra splurge for yourself im sure you deserve it live it up,Mentalcomposer
and one other tip if you drink red wine the eastwest red blend is really good its an ncl proprietary blend,Mentalcomposer
and the gerard bertrand cab is also really good,Mentalcomposer
figure out realistically how many drinks you are going to have from the premium list,Mentalcomposer
add in the cost of the excursions youre looking at taking and see if,Mentalcomposer
the cost works out to even close to what youd pay extra then id say yea,Mentalcomposer
if you really only like one or two baileys after dinner lets say then it might be cheaper to just pay for those few drinks,Mentalcomposer
and if youre gonna sit on a beach a few times or can excursions for much cheaper maybe not,Mentalcomposer
and your sis can get the unlimited wifi that she wants,Mentalcomposer
its all really a money numbers game,Mentalcomposer
but with sis not drinking i dont think youre gonna come close to it making money sense that extra  300 vs just paying gratuities on the regular free at sea drink pkg makes a big diff i would think,Mentalcomposer
i think a trip to dmv would be the next step hopefully you can get a decent person there that can help you track down where your license physically is right now,Mentalcomposer
maybe they can cancel that license and reissue one to your new address,Mentalcomposer
try having your license showing the physical address but your paperwork having a mailing address  the po box,Mentalcomposer
i know dmv  is the absolute last place you want to go but i would think thats the best way,Mentalcomposer
as far as the paperwork id use my married name show the ss card and ins card,Mentalcomposer
id make sure my insurance is in the married name like your ss card,Mentalcomposer
what do ppl who dont have dls do i wonder,Mentalcomposer
if they need more show the ss married nameold dl  maiden and marriage certificate  connect the two to prove youre the same person,Mentalcomposer
take a look at this page,Mentalcomposer
im looking into using this transport from livorno its 35 each,Mentalcomposer
but you have to get to livorno town from the port,Mentalcomposer
what they mean is you have the original invoice which shows the lower amount that you paid and shows you owe a zero balance,Mentalcomposer
that is your proof that you paid what was due,Mentalcomposer
your lower priced invoice should have a date on it and you can show that you paid the amount on the day you booked,Mentalcomposer
i would call them it doesnt seem like they actually understood what you were asking them,Mentalcomposer
they told you it was paid in full  it didnt mention anything about why the amounts changed,Mentalcomposer
make sure you explicitly say that you have an original invoice with a diff dollar amount,Mentalcomposer
im grasping at straws right now but,Mentalcomposer
it looks like its the ksf discount is it possible the child discount is dependent on the age of the child and once you corrected your sons bday it put him into a diff age category so the discount is different idk never heard it being done that way,Mentalcomposer
thats what they just dont get,Mentalcomposer
they get elected and vote or support whatever their own personal opinion is on an issue or they just go along with the party line whether they agree with it or not or whether we agree with it or not,Mentalcomposer
how about they start listening to what their constituents want we elected them to do what we want not whatever it is they want,Mentalcomposer
these people are supposed to be our voice,Mentalcomposer
since you have your original confirmation you can ask them to go over each charge one by one to find the difference,Mentalcomposer
just throwing this out,Mentalcomposer
did they maybe add on their cruise insurance  you dont have to get it but i would strongly advise you have some kind of insurance,Mentalcomposer
or did they add in the daily service charge which doesnt have to be pre paid but will be billed to your onboard acct each day you sail,Mentalcomposer
that is a cop out answer im sure she loves her kitchen at home the best but do you want your reception in her living room,Mentalcomposer
does he really want his mom cooking the day of his wedding  all day,Mentalcomposer
does she even realize that shes going to miss her sons wedding by being in the kitchen,Mentalcomposer
is she gonna take the apron off for the mother son dance at least,Mentalcomposer
come on im sure shes a great cook but she can leave the cooking to someone else and just enjoy the day,Mentalcomposer
you work and hes a house boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
but hes your house boyfriend who doesnt live with you,Mentalcomposer
so basically youre supporting some guy who you dont know and somehow think this is an actual relationship,Mentalcomposer
and you think its perfectly reasonable to buy him a car and not just any car a luxury car,Mentalcomposer
and you think the biggest problem in this whole scenario is that his parents are going to think some other imaginary girl bought him the car he just magically shows up with one day,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
he got mad that you werent looking at him while he was trying to show you something,Mentalcomposer
but  he must not have been looking at you when he started this conversation about something you should look at  or else he would have known you were looking at something else,Mentalcomposer
so he cant complain you werent looking when neither was he,Mentalcomposer
this is a stupid argument anyway,Mentalcomposer
my doc told me to just take vitamin d and calcium,Mentalcomposer
i think were trying to see if it will stave of osteoporosis,Mentalcomposer
my mom was on fosomax for osteoporosis and didnt have any side effects this was a while ago tho idk if theres newer drugs,Mentalcomposer
a nice photo album of the two of you through the years if you have any special thoughts on what was going on in the pictures you can write them in,Mentalcomposer
show him what all those years meant to you by having him in them,Mentalcomposer
and of course the obligatory 1 dad shirt or coffee mug,Mentalcomposer
i had barely knew my future mil when we got engaged of course we met but we didnt spend very much time together,Mentalcomposer
my mother had one rule,Mentalcomposer
she and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping she paid for out dress and it was a motherdaughter thing,Mentalcomposer
no friends no sisters  i have 3 no anybody else,Mentalcomposer
none of the mils had a problem with this once it was explained and my mil only had boys so she would never get that experience,Mentalcomposer
now i also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning,Mentalcomposer
so i invited my mil to the food tasting at the catering hall just me and her h was workingand brought and showed her everything we were debating on i wanted her to feel involved it was her sons wedding also,Mentalcomposer
your sil and mil are out of order definitely no argument there but mil may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle which she shouldnt,Mentalcomposer
so maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning you dont have to take her picks or advice but at least make her feel like she is in the know so to speak and remember its her sons wedding also she just doesnt want to show up and have no idea what its gonna be like,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i absolutely love your idea,Mentalcomposer
it showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldnt handle it,Mentalcomposer
and bravo for handling the grandparents brilliant,Mentalcomposer
i think your h should be the one telling the kids he can explain why it wasnt a good idea at this time mostly because he couldnt keep up with the conditions,Mentalcomposer
he might mention it wouldnt be very fair to mom who doesnt want the dog if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
why william would ever want to even talk to h after such a betrayal is beyond me some things you just dont come back from and what h has done is one of them can you even imagine the deep hurt w feels coming from his only sibling,Mentalcomposer
i can see charles wanting some sort of relationship he is his son after all but i would like to think even charles realizes it needs to be a distant check in how you doing sort of relationship kind of like you dont wish any harm but you dont go out of your way to be close,Mentalcomposer
charles aside harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him and the wife not a snowbells chance in hell,Mentalcomposer
they had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family at the expense of family,Mentalcomposer
now they have neither the quicker they realize that the better,Mentalcomposer
from one 30 married to another ive always said thats the secret,Mentalcomposer
of course we love each other but we actually like each other thats a big distinction isnt it one im not sure some people understand,Mentalcomposer
wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you,Mentalcomposer
yeah sorry none of that is even remotely ok especially that disrespectful bs with the picture can he not have an adult conversation,Mentalcomposer
is it a matter of him not having any money but then he should have at least acknowledged the day,Mentalcomposer
does he not do anything for any special day at all,Mentalcomposer
you need a serious come to jesus talk with him how exactly does he see you and this relationship is he in love with you or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now,Mentalcomposer
sorry to be so blunt,Mentalcomposer
take a good hard look at your relationship im gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you,Mentalcomposer
the best way to act in this situation,Mentalcomposer
you reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted but its run its course,Mentalcomposer
youve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now hes moving even farther away do you really want to keep this up a few days together every once in a while,Mentalcomposer
how about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with,Mentalcomposer
info please,Mentalcomposer
ok you had the conversation but what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day,Mentalcomposer
we need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice,Mentalcomposer
it wasnt your moms fault,Mentalcomposer
your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway since you didnt your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldnt work,Mentalcomposer
was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn hindi your mom points this out but you dont actually say if this is what you wanted also,Mentalcomposer
long distance is hard your mom maybe didnt want you two separated for that long she likes your gf didnt want to see you break up,Mentalcomposer
the dream may not have happened but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture,Mentalcomposer
i dont think your mom had any bad intentions your just sad and want to blame someone,Mentalcomposer
did anyone really need a study to know this,Mentalcomposer
i love a good full salad,Mentalcomposer
but i hate all the chopping that goes into it so i make a huge salad that can last about 3 days so as long as its readily available ill eat it,Mentalcomposer
maybe try that make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that he knows hes overweight and hes probably embarrassed by it,Mentalcomposer
so i wouldnt harp on it too much for fear of making him feel even worse about it if he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels that will add to his feeling bad about himself  not saying you do this just that kids might twist it to that,Mentalcomposer
maybe just a gentle  hey kiddo covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us i worked so much i didnt really see what was going on with you or your bro im sorry im not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy if you want to or need help figuring out what we can do im here ill listen and well figure it out together and if theres anything else youre struggling with and need help well get some help i just want you healthy and happy,Mentalcomposer
then leave him alone about it maybe just give him a few extra hugs,Mentalcomposer
he knows what he has to do and he has a world of info with the internet if he wants to do it himself,Mentalcomposer
editing after seeing some of op replies,Mentalcomposer
therapy would be great but only if hes ok with it otherwise hell just refuse to talk he seems to have a lot going on teens seem to be coming out of covid with mental health issues add to that his confusion of his sexuality and its a lot for a teen to deal with,Mentalcomposer
have you taken him for a full physical covid weight gain is real but thats a lot of weight maybe theres a medical reason id at least rule that out,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
lets see if mom is willing to support her,Mentalcomposer
i get the whole dont make her pay cause im the parent and all that,Mentalcomposer
but that only works as long as you can afford it,Mentalcomposer
what kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help,Mentalcomposer
a selfish one,Mentalcomposer
your d needs to be on her own for a while shell get a dose of real life,Mentalcomposer
im not judging at all,Mentalcomposer
just saying theres a lot missing from the info they put out,Mentalcomposer
i can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas perfectly fine so i wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party not good,Mentalcomposer
how did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we dont try to kill anyone we have a problem with its a nuclear option to use sad really,Mentalcomposer
right,Mentalcomposer
so there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station,Mentalcomposer
did someone bring the 5 yo to the party,Mentalcomposer
was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire  but why would the child be out of the car,Mentalcomposer
so many questions,Mentalcomposer
time lots of time,Mentalcomposer
you need to date someone until you know them really know them,Mentalcomposer
we rush into relationship ships because we want someone anyone were so afraid of falling behind our friends our peers that we take good enough instead of good,Mentalcomposer
no guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc,Mentalcomposer
yea hes being mean and unhelpful to boot,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older little people need lots of help finding their stuff,Mentalcomposer
ok  nta,Mentalcomposer
whatever she did with it she should have picked it up i dont care how busy she is shes been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days,Mentalcomposer
and then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it thats a massive over reaction,Mentalcomposer
time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse,Mentalcomposer
did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom,Mentalcomposer
how did it get soaking wet,Mentalcomposer
i heard it a couple days ago its heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy,Mentalcomposer
but i also wondered why the coaches were not required to know cpr,Mentalcomposer
even if not you try  you have 911 walk you thru it just something,Mentalcomposer
i was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts every leader,Mentalcomposer
thank goodness mine are grown or now id be staying thru every practice and game,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
im so confused,Mentalcomposer
you dated kate but never met her family for 4 years how you must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs,Mentalcomposer
next you break up with kate during college and what change colleges to the one thats a state over maybe things happen,Mentalcomposer
then you meet julia who wont let you meet her fam because she went nc because they sent her away where to take care of her sister would this be kate,Mentalcomposer
you finally meet julias fam who turn out to be kates fam and what do you know julia also lives in your old neighborhood,Mentalcomposer
and instead of acknowledging to the parents that you and kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met julia you say nothing you tell julia and shes just hunky dory about it,Mentalcomposer
and kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag that she had been pregnant in college not exactly what his think would be dinner convo but whatever,Mentalcomposer
then you yell at kate because why,Mentalcomposer
so i call bs on all of it,Mentalcomposer
so heres my very rudimentary explanation i dont own a gun,Mentalcomposer
the us is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered there was nothing except for the indian settlements but there was vast wilderness,Mentalcomposer
guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival had to hunt for food protect land and animal stock and yes even protection from horse rustlers and robbers,Mentalcomposer
so then we fight for our independence from a country who had a national army,Mentalcomposer
way back we had no central army  we had 13 colonies spread far apart and communication would take days so even if we wanted a central army it wasnt feasible so each state had its own militia to be used in case of attack by a foreign army,Mentalcomposer
thats why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms we were determined not to be ruled over again,Mentalcomposer
as the country became more industrialized and modern there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals you have to realize just how big this country is there are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness,Mentalcomposer
there are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill it was there way of life after all or they just enjoy hunting,Mentalcomposer
so while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns legally and that gets us into a whole other conversation,Mentalcomposer
so you cant bar someone from legally buying a gun in most cases it is their right but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes,Mentalcomposer
theres lots of ideas going around but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen,Mentalcomposer
while your stat is true it needs to be put in perspective,Mentalcomposer
as per this website,Mentalcomposer
we found that some 297033 children were married in the us between 2000 and 2018 232474 based on marriagecertificate data plus 64559 based on estimates table 1 a few children were as young as 10 years when they married but of those for whom age information was available nearly all96were aged 16 or 17 years of those for whom age gender and spousal information was available 78 were girls under 18 years of age wed to adult men aged 18 years or older the national number of children wed decreased each yearfrom 76396 in 2000 to 2493 in 2018 table 2but is unlikely to get to zero without legislative intervention,Mentalcomposer
so 96 were 16 and 17 hardly what most people think of when they hear  child marriages,Mentalcomposer
and the number for 2018 is 2493 total out of 350 million people,Mentalcomposer
in comparison,Mentalcomposer
one out of every five marriages in iran is a child marriage,Mentalcomposer
a total of 550565 marriages were registered in march 2018 to march 2019 in 112647 cases the bride was ages 17 years or less more than a fifth of marriages registered in iran during that year were therefore child marriages by unicefs measurefeb 9 2020,Mentalcomposer
features,Mentalcomposer
twenty percent of marriages in iran are child marriages,Mentalcomposer
iran has a population of about 85 million people,Mentalcomposer
from the same article,Mentalcomposer
data from the national organization for civil registration records that around 1100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 20172018 more recently the figure has been around 2600 girls this is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year  which is a large and significant number considering the legal obligation to secure court approval the law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is expedient to do so,Mentalcomposer
now i condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance but two 16 or 17 yos who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff  than a  12 and under literal child marrying a grown man,Mentalcomposer
how long were you dating before you moved in,Mentalcomposer
it hasnt even been a year that youve been together which means you havent even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person,Mentalcomposer
it isnt all about love thats part of the problem you think that just because he loves you hes going to think of your wants and needs all the time hell be appreciative of any little thing you do for him and the household,Mentalcomposer
youre under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will be magically better,Mentalcomposer
but the reality is hes a depressed guy who wont do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesnt have to deal with real life,Mentalcomposer
next time he tells you to leave do it,Mentalcomposer
save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life,Mentalcomposer
thank you  lots of good info,Mentalcomposer
that sounds like my kind of cruise,Mentalcomposer
what youre failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people,Mentalcomposer
thats you being selfish,Mentalcomposer
you didnt like lily because she was in effect taking kaleb away from you you didnt want to share him,Mentalcomposer
now id say you probably didnt intentionally kill her because thats just too out there,Mentalcomposer
but you also didnt try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you,Mentalcomposer
you cant claim it was just your dad you were an adult at the time,Mentalcomposer
you didnt give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her,Mentalcomposer
you wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you and when he didnt you and your dad tried to rush him along and when that didnt work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for him if he wanted anything to do with you im sure he knows exactly where to find you,Mentalcomposer
i am extra careful around mirrors and will not walk under a ladder,Mentalcomposer
i always say you never know so ill follow the superstition just in case,Mentalcomposer
now i have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor never heard that one,Mentalcomposer
have you been on any other lines and can you compare them,Mentalcomposer
im not too worried about the food im not a foodie so unless something is clearly inedible im fine,Mentalcomposer
what was the sea day activities like and the night shows and casino,Mentalcomposer
oh and i also liked pic 4,Mentalcomposer
are you a photographer because id never even think to take that shot yet its pretty great,Mentalcomposer
i think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them,Mentalcomposer
really nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of  thats where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay but the friends they went with might want to relive those memories,Mentalcomposer
of course keep any that have no nudity in them landscapes signs etc so that youd have a timeline of their travels if anyone would really want to know,Mentalcomposer
just a thought,Mentalcomposer
i dont want to come off as mean,Mentalcomposer
but were you really tricked,Mentalcomposer
you really thought a 52 yo  when he started dating you at 28 father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a baby,Mentalcomposer
some might but the majority wont,Mentalcomposer
he wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego,Mentalcomposer
if you want a child do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have and be involved in raising his child,Mentalcomposer
oh great  now well have to hear all about what they got wrong,Mentalcomposer
do these two really not have any sense of humor  laugh it off once in a while,Mentalcomposer
they must be fun at parties,Mentalcomposer
you have a lot going on so i dont know if this will be helpful or not,Mentalcomposer
but i can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and i did have the dizziness and nausea,Mentalcomposer
so that symptom may well be connected to menopause,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i cant help with anything else,Mentalcomposer
weve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child those examples are i think more the exception than the rule,Mentalcomposer
most parents dont have a favorite but we recognize that each child has something special or different that their sibs dont have one can talk to anyone anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people one is an athlete and one is artistic ones a spender ones a saver those things,Mentalcomposer
and when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that thing so the child can make the most of it for themselves,Mentalcomposer
so every child is the favorite if you want to call it that in a diff category,Mentalcomposer
at least thats how i saw and did it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i think its perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids,Mentalcomposer
but you are too young to be left alone for a week and its your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week thats what makes your parents ta,Mentalcomposer
do you have a best friend that you can stay with,Mentalcomposer
you need to make your parents understand its the leaving you home alone that is not right,Mentalcomposer
i say go for it,Mentalcomposer
you really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like,Mentalcomposer
some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life,Mentalcomposer
others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day,Mentalcomposer
you dont know where youre going to fall in the range and youll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary short lived hard time,Mentalcomposer
surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case,Mentalcomposer
id give a student teacher a bit more leeway just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson,Mentalcomposer
but i agree the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind just in general teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn thats not a bad idea,Mentalcomposer
its repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation but invaluable for the ones that got it on the last explanation,Mentalcomposer
im still not understanding,Mentalcomposer
you park your car on the street this is not a private parking lot or something is it,Mentalcomposer
is it correct to say that your car is not blocking their driveway but is parked between two driveways on the street so in front of a home,Mentalcomposer
are you parking in front of your neighbors house and thats why they are mad they do not own the street parking in front of their home can you not park in front of your own home,Mentalcomposer
i cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket even if they have been called by the neighbor if you are not parked illegally how do you even call a traffic officer,Mentalcomposer
im not really sure what to tell you maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked legally,Mentalcomposer
or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you,Mentalcomposer
or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally,Mentalcomposer
if you dont mind can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please,Mentalcomposer
im trying to keep up but honestly its too much info thats constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense,Mentalcomposer
i thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine and mostly in youngish people,Mentalcomposer
your gf is insane none of this is normal,Mentalcomposer
she knows her big v day gift is a play she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her,Mentalcomposer
none of that was enough,Mentalcomposer
she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past failure on gift giving occasions,Mentalcomposer
hell no your gf has a way over inflated opinion of her worth,Mentalcomposer
how long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances,Mentalcomposer
this is your first relationship so im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to but ill tell you this this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out,Mentalcomposer
you should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her,Mentalcomposer
take a long hard look at what she adds to your life ill bet not much,Mentalcomposer
do you frequently feel as tho you arent doing enough do her wants and needs count for more than your own have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didnt and you gave in,Mentalcomposer
simply put shes treating you like shit and youre taking it and asking for more please time to send her packing,Mentalcomposer
it could be as simple as keeping the good stuff he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks,Mentalcomposer
or he just couldnt be bothered to pack it up and ship it,Mentalcomposer
even if you pay for him to ship it he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway,Mentalcomposer
dont read too much into it,Mentalcomposer
just write him and the keyboard off get yourself a new keyboard,Mentalcomposer
youre 2 months in it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you,Mentalcomposer
so early on is the honeymoon phase you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not you have to really know the other person warts and all as the saying goes,Mentalcomposer
work on your anger issues and see how it goes,Mentalcomposer
dont pressure her to commit long term this early it comes off as insecure needy and obsessive,Mentalcomposer
she should have some idea that an engagement is in her future so its not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesnt like,Mentalcomposer
you can then ask if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own,Mentalcomposer
we never even discussed rings at all and i love mine i looked at it like  he got what he wanted me to have she may want you to do that also,Mentalcomposer
just ask her,Mentalcomposer
i have to say that in this instance i cant imagine you would even want to see your father for a while due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom,Mentalcomposer
and its not a taking sides thing its more the way he went about leaving her it was unnecessarily cruel of him,Mentalcomposer
so youre nta for limiting contact at least for a while until you get your own anger and disappointment under control,Mentalcomposer
after things settle down a bit you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your h at your home while he visits,Mentalcomposer
hugs to your mom,Mentalcomposer
are you that busy that you cant look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have,Mentalcomposer
decide on a few styles you like go back to the jeweler and pick one,Mentalcomposer
theres no need for a middleman,Mentalcomposer
try to figure out why you are eating,Mentalcomposer
are you bored your life seems pretty active at school and when youre home youre probably bored you need to schedule more activity during the day,Mentalcomposer
or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food you might just be thirsty and if not it will at least fill you enough that you wont feel the need to eat right at that time,Mentalcomposer
also remember you arent burning as many calories at home that you do at school it may be that youre not even eating so many calories youre just not offsetting them with exercise,Mentalcomposer
but he expects you to have 23 hours to clean after looking after the house and kids all day and going to school,Mentalcomposer
im not even sure what level of clean hes looking for  i get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company but you could dust on monday and by tuesday night its back not as much but its there the kids toys shouldnt be scattered around the house but thats a 5 min task,Mentalcomposer
ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours,Mentalcomposer
very very slight yta just for phrasing,Mentalcomposer
instead of saying normal moms,Mentalcomposer
you should have said something more along the lines of  you knew we were going clubbing why didnt you have your h watch the baby for a few hours im assuming these were plans made in advance,Mentalcomposer
did she ever give a reason why her h couldnt watch the baby,Mentalcomposer
im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not and more to do with her mindset she feels shes not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear shes has a mindset that moms dont do clubbing and shes tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active she just hasnt figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode,Mentalcomposer
shes going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities,Mentalcomposer
so get more video proof id put cameras in every direction ones that can pick up sound so you have everything recorded,Mentalcomposer
you put up with it for a few years you can hang on another 6 months,Mentalcomposer
its not you but escalating isnt the way to go about it and you know the second you retaliate the cops will be showing up at your door you dont need that in your life,Mentalcomposer
think of it this way is it fair to the girl youre dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship,Mentalcomposer
no its not,Mentalcomposer
you need to tell her whats going on,Mentalcomposer
she deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely,Mentalcomposer
its a new thing so she likely isnt too invested yet,Mentalcomposer
and you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating,Mentalcomposer
im not in this fight but i found this just because i was curious,Mentalcomposer
its from 2021 so i have no idea if it is was ever implemented,Mentalcomposer
also its from a womans forum so i was surprised by their stance,Mentalcomposer
i think theyre asking what have you been given that isnt  sex because in a committed relationship sex will be happening,Mentalcomposer
its just worded oddly,Mentalcomposer
it cant be off the table and also given,Mentalcomposer
stay home make a nice dinner both agree to dress up for dinner something your so really likes that you wouldnt normally be comfortable going out in him too tho something you like to see him not thats not  the usual open a bottle of wine and spend the night connecting as a couple,Mentalcomposer
ah see i learned something new,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the diff between the two,Mentalcomposer
ah learned something new today,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the distinction,Mentalcomposer
excellent point this is a key distinction,Mentalcomposer
i perceive antisocial with being more aggressive maybe  at or when meeting new people,Mentalcomposer
but someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections,Mentalcomposer
big diff in advice to be given,Mentalcomposer
they wont let you bring them on when you board,Mentalcomposer
and they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port,Mentalcomposer
so basically no,Mentalcomposer
but i heard if youre cruising europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep  but you should confirm that,Mentalcomposer
get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle,Mentalcomposer
this way youre not paying for books you might not like,Mentalcomposer
how about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed,Mentalcomposer
theres usually a lot more nuance in the book that you cant get from the movie and you already know you like the story,Mentalcomposer
that might make you more willing to set aside time to read,Mentalcomposer
no its fine but do you understand the point i was trying to explain,Mentalcomposer
trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just lgbq people,Mentalcomposer
what youre missing is the baker wouldnt make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions,Mentalcomposer
idk anything about the gender one tho but im guessing probably the same reason but thats a guess,Mentalcomposer
its not a matter of not agreeingwith lgbtq  at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities,Mentalcomposer
but trans ppl arent as simple as a diff sexuality they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality so i think that confuses people who dont understand how that can be so its as if they dont understand it it cant be true in a sense,Mentalcomposer
adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages doesnt sit well with a lot of people theres a feeling that its too much too soon,Mentalcomposer
is it right or wrong i have no idea,Mentalcomposer
then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use sports competition moral issues like the baker and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight  and this is what were seeing now,Mentalcomposer
i liked it  im not a huge fan i knew some of the songs,Mentalcomposer
i thought it was simple but at least for the most part it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do sing her songs,Mentalcomposer
i liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good,Mentalcomposer
but i also dont like when theres so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle when theres too much going on all at once sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places that way you dont really see the whole production,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see is that youve only been with your bf a few months,Mentalcomposer
you admit yourself that you do not know him well enough or know enough about him that you need to know,Mentalcomposer
and this is why you never should have met his kids if you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave those kids will be sad and confused,Mentalcomposer
but im also confused about something is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day with an hour to spare to see you,Mentalcomposer
where is the kids mom,Mentalcomposer
was this how it was when you first met,Mentalcomposer
why cant you spend the evenings at his house and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep,Mentalcomposer
why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone elses boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
this is just plain wrong you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule nobody should have to tell you this,Mentalcomposer
stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk no good will ever come from this,Mentalcomposer
he may sleep with you but hes going back to his gf,Mentalcomposer
thats a bit harder to fix because its an issue for you but to him its not really an issue,Mentalcomposer
can you maybe schedule a few days a week i know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life but at least both of you are on the same page and sometimes it works just by the anticipation,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind would you rather have sex for the sake of having it or would you rather have really good sex,Mentalcomposer
sometimes quality over quantity,Mentalcomposer
also maybe dont put too much pressure on him start with 2 times a week and work up to 3 or however many works,Mentalcomposer
but you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term youve already spent 7 years and its not easy to leave when theres so much good but you dont want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either,Mentalcomposer
if its a matter of frequency then he doesnt see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok  and it is,Mentalcomposer
its just that yours and his do not match,Mentalcomposer
if its more a matter of what youre doing together you need to ask why he isnt willing to experiment some people just dont like some sex acts and really shouldnt be made to do them if it isnt their thing,Mentalcomposer
you matched with her first but your bro was texting with her before you started dating,Mentalcomposer
how did that even happen,Mentalcomposer
you both must have been at the very least texting or talking with her at the same time and how did you find out bro was talking to her,Mentalcomposer
look if you dont see moving forward with her just let her go  why drag it out any longer,Mentalcomposer
so does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads,Mentalcomposer
everything about this is just  off,Mentalcomposer
you pay your ex child support but you have him all day,Mentalcomposer
do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 5050 no one pays child support and then youll have time for your bf,Mentalcomposer
so dont give her access to all the money,Mentalcomposer
sit her down and show her your finances,Mentalcomposer
take the 4800 for the month minus all your household bills by now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to  food etc,Mentalcomposer
take the net  thats left and left decide how much goes into emergency fund long term savings and depending on whats left decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself,Mentalcomposer
open separate accounts for the emergency savings and one for her money,Mentalcomposer
leaving is impulsive she doesnt work and you have two small kids your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony  maybe and child support,Mentalcomposer
you say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants its still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible,Mentalcomposer
where was your mom for those 2 hours,Mentalcomposer
you should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to or your gf is so sickly contagious that its dangerous for you to be in your shared bed,Mentalcomposer
how long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry and in that time your gf went upstairs got ready for bed and also fell asleep,Mentalcomposer
oh and conveniently sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed so its a guess each night,Mentalcomposer
either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to have a fight or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her,Mentalcomposer
she really couldnt just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together,Mentalcomposer
thats pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her,Mentalcomposer
the thing you need to remember is this,Mentalcomposer
when we start to date we have no idea what were doing were all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bfgf thing so we date and we break up a lot mostly with no rhyme or reason,Mentalcomposer
who knows what your bf is thinking but dating you just isnt working for him anymore doesnt mean you did anything wrong,Mentalcomposer
stop being sad look at this as a learning lesson,Mentalcomposer
the lesson is enjoy it while it lasts take a day or two to mourn it and move on  but that doesnt mean on to yet another boy just for the sake of having a boy,Mentalcomposer
this too shall pass,Mentalcomposer
most people realize that the 2 party system the us has is not working i think mainly because theres an us vs them mentality most elected officials dont think for themselves and just go along with party lines,Mentalcomposer
thats not to say they dont personally agree with some issues but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has,Mentalcomposer
and third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there thats why the third party is looked at as a water vote,Mentalcomposer
that out of the way how does this sound,Mentalcomposer
a third party but with candidates in every state where an election is being held with a pretty centrist platform take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that or whatever it is,Mentalcomposer
national elections take place every evennumbered year every four years the president vice president onethird of the senate and the entire house are up for election onyear elections on evennumbered years when there isnt a presidential election onethird of the senate and the whole house are included in the election offyear elections,Mentalcomposer
so next year this third party could  have people running who could theoretically change  the whole look of all branches of govt,Mentalcomposer
im not gonna explain this correctly so bear with me,Mentalcomposer
how do we do this we let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states so me in state a can say i want to vote for party 3 and id like their agenda to be implemented i know one person from my state cant do anything alone but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives  we can implement our platform,Mentalcomposer
it might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party,Mentalcomposer
could be that you just dont have an actual sexual attraction to that person her being good looking isnt really the only criteria,Mentalcomposer
maybe you need to have an emotional,Mentalcomposer
attraction to a partner as well sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical,Mentalcomposer
and just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails,Mentalcomposer
for me its not about trying to hold the family together,Mentalcomposer
its more the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and i recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life it could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam it could be theres more to the story between his mom and dad that even the op doesnt know it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child,Mentalcomposer
but whatever the reason if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him,Mentalcomposer
thats just my take,Mentalcomposer
if nephew wouldnt show up anyway you might as well extend the invite,Mentalcomposer
it keeps the peace with your brother and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it,Mentalcomposer
but if you can schedule on moms weekend youd be better off,Mentalcomposer
as an aside,Mentalcomposer
im still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her childs family what did she want to happen shed raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that  dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its your money that you earned,Mentalcomposer
its not as if you spend some of it youre putting an undue burden on your parents,Mentalcomposer
the fact is even with a full scholarship there are day to day expenses that you need money for,Mentalcomposer
coffee with friends a movie gasetc,Mentalcomposer
why dont you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount dont divide all the money you have so its gone by the last month of school just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with,Mentalcomposer
youll have some spending money and youll also still have some savings when you graduate unless something big comes up in the next few years,Mentalcomposer
i found it odd too,Mentalcomposer
the woman tho i heard they have more info but not releasing it just yet something about who the man is that was seen running away,Mentalcomposer
the other guy it seems is a workplace issue the guy who killed him was an ex employee he was a gas or electric co employee so im not sure him being an elected official has anything to do with it,Mentalcomposer
now if the same guy killed both then we have a story,Mentalcomposer
honestly he sounds a bit too controlling for my tastes but,Mentalcomposer
we really dont know you nor what your individual needs are,Mentalcomposer
so if you say his what we see as controlling but you see as taking anxiety inducing decisions off of you then maybe its not as we see it,Mentalcomposer
have you tried to explain to your parents exactly how him making these decisions are actually helpful to you rather than harmful  im getting the impression they arent seeing what value they add to your well being,Mentalcomposer
this is also your first relationship so you dont really know how it should work do you you have nothing to compare him against the good and the bad,Mentalcomposer
as far as staying home after you marry it sounds lovely doesnt it until he starts complaining that youre hobbies are taking up too much of your free time and youre not dedicating enough time on his needs,Mentalcomposer
and framing it as you just arent using your time efficiently,Mentalcomposer
be on the look out for that please thats when you should reassess the whole him making decision ideas,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should work part time a few hours a few days a week just to retain some semblance of independence,Mentalcomposer
maybe start with asking her to study or out for coffee,Mentalcomposer
you and she both should spend time together to see if you actually do like each other before you commit to something like the prom  idk any proms that are soon so im basing this off the us version of a prom,Mentalcomposer
dont fall back into the its ok most days tho,Mentalcomposer
work it out now for everyones happiness yours theirs and your child,Mentalcomposer
you may open a pandoras box but wouldnt you rather know that now than years from now  yes you would,Mentalcomposer
hey im on your side,Mentalcomposer
i just meant not to bring up the money part of it in a i paid for it way,Mentalcomposer
def ok to say why are you not done yet its been 7 yrs,Mentalcomposer
i would never hire someone to clean thats just a waste of money when someone is home all day with seemingly nothing else to do,Mentalcomposer
and absolutely do not being up being able to find another partner as tempting as that may be,Mentalcomposer
but i would say i didnt sign up to be and do everything in this relationship i need an equal partner and i have to know if youre willing to step up and be a partner or this isnt going to work for me,Mentalcomposer
youve gotten some great ideas how to approach the things that need to be brought up,Mentalcomposer
please organize and use them and let us know how it goes,Mentalcomposer
yeah no,Mentalcomposer
no way my partner would be waking up mid day thats just disrespectful on a whole other level id start waking them up when the rest of the household gets up in the morning,Mentalcomposer
your poor kid even recognizes that one parent is basically useless,Mentalcomposer
thats another point you can point out to your partner  i need to sleep to get up for work and kid has in the past refused to even ask you to do a late pickup knowing you will refuse its affecting them and we cannot have that going forward its not fair to our child,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt harp too much on the accounting course but it needs to be mentioned that may come off as a money thing even if its not instead of a  it shouldnt take 7 years to finish a 2 yr program thing,Mentalcomposer
whoever cooks should be cleaning since they make the mess normally its the opposite but your partner seems unusually messy during cooking,Mentalcomposer
have that chat give yourself some time to organize what you want to say and how you want to say it,Mentalcomposer
you might as well just come out and ask if they dont want to be here anymore since this is the impression,Mentalcomposer
they are clearly giving,Mentalcomposer
send child out to a friends house i have a feeling this might not go so well,Mentalcomposer
that article was condemned by pretty much everyone that read it,Mentalcomposer
since i dont know what can they do to clarkson can they make it so he can never write for a paper again,Mentalcomposer
fine him charge him with a crime,Mentalcomposer
or will they just condemn it like everyone else,Mentalcomposer
omg yes,Mentalcomposer
especially when its only a few months in,Mentalcomposer
if youre having this many or this big of a problem after a few months just get out,Mentalcomposer
why try to save a bad relationship,Mentalcomposer
laid out like this obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho how did it get like this,Mentalcomposer
you didnt just move in and you were doing the lions share was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less did partner start out as a sahp which if chores went undone it wasnt a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time but then did they just get used to not doing much,Mentalcomposer
this was me but any mention by my partner that things werent getting done caused some small level of guilt like i wasnt holding up my end of the bargain i wasnt being a good partner but thats just me,Mentalcomposer
you need a serious sit down with your partner,Mentalcomposer
does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way,Mentalcomposer
do they have a hobby that theyre dedicating all their time to,Mentalcomposer
and in a very non accusatory  way you need to ask what the hell they do all day while you are at work,Mentalcomposer
kid is in school for most of the day i can see having to drop off and pick up but partner seems to basically do nothing,Mentalcomposer
make a list divide the work and specify specific days of the week things need to get done,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason laundry cant be done every other day for instance,Mentalcomposer
its a nice thought but it really would not stop brandon from drinking,Mentalcomposer
the bigger problem is that brandon does not recognize that he is an alcoholic despite going thru rehab,Mentalcomposer
its normal to relapse but he seemingly has no plans to try to get back to sober,Mentalcomposer
and its not that you dont like the real him you actually do like real brandon its drunk brandon you dont like,Mentalcomposer
maybe your fianc should be having a come to jesus talk with brandon,Mentalcomposer
its fine if he decides that wants to be a jobless drunk but brandons friends should  be able to decide if they want to be friends with a jobless drunk regardless of how long the friendship has been,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with,Mentalcomposer
you already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another so its not a case of thinking you couldnt get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family  as some may think,Mentalcomposer
its pretty obvious she isnt treated as a d but as an adopted d,Mentalcomposer
she is your oldest child why didnt she get a car and pay for her school even if she got some scholarship you think she had to take loans so why didnt you just pick up the difference,Mentalcomposer
do you really think she does not know that shes the not wanted child shes a part of this family in name only,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her she would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living family and parents,Mentalcomposer
whats the rush  with this guy or any other,Mentalcomposer
youre  in your early 20s with already one marriage that didnt make it  totally understandable and youre still not untangled financially from the first guy,Mentalcomposer
if you were with the first guy for 3 years and dating this guy for 1 year youre only 23 you got married at what 18 or 19,Mentalcomposer
this guy might be the best guy ever but maybe you should just keep your separate space for a long while longer date him while being on your own for a while,Mentalcomposer
so thats what you tell him  im not untangled yet and im not doing anything until that gets settled and im not jumping into living with anyone  until i know them inside and out and  been thru good and bad and very bad,Mentalcomposer
but why if you were happy with her and wanted to make a life with her are you so compelled to talk to women online,Mentalcomposer
you must realize that makes you pretty sleazy,Mentalcomposer
thats why shes leaving you not because of some grand scam she was trying to pull,Mentalcomposer
she might have been happy to leave everyone and everything she has back home for a better life with you,Mentalcomposer
but you didnt exactly treat her with enough respect to lay off the other women,Mentalcomposer
i dont really care that you never physically cheated just the fact that its been going on for the whole duration of your marriage is a testament to what kind of man you really are,Mentalcomposer
it just took her too long to find out,Mentalcomposer
this is all on you,Mentalcomposer
i hate saying it but youre right,Mentalcomposer
she should have never been alone,Mentalcomposer
the h knew she was having problems im sure his and her family knew even if they never dreamed in a million years she would do something like this  because who would even think it at least have someone with her just to take some of the stress of everyday life with 2 kids and a newborn,Mentalcomposer
its just so tragically sad,Mentalcomposer
is it possible that hes starting to think that hes leaving his 70 yo mom alone and thats why hes pushing for her to go,Mentalcomposer
idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it,Mentalcomposer
has he explained why he doesnt think your mom and sister cant be trusted to come with you,Mentalcomposer
thats an odd thing to say,Mentalcomposer
is he afraid your mom and sis wont contribute financially to the renting of the property because apparently his mom wont be and hes worried it will all fall to you guys,Mentalcomposer
so maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home so you and h wont be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end,Mentalcomposer
idk just throwing out ideas,Mentalcomposer
its not what they do or say its what they do or say in that moment,Mentalcomposer
if they shut down someone being rude snarky or harassing the first time it happens that goes a long way to show people that you have confidence in yourself and arent going to take any crap from anyone,Mentalcomposer
you know hes kind of down in the dumps lately i think it would be a really loving gesture for you to do something nice for him without expecting anything in return,Mentalcomposer
you can agree to watching a movie together but maybe you can make a surprise nice dinner for you two maybe his favorite just to cheer him up or a dish you make really really well pick up a candy heart and share it as you watch the movie buy a bag of those hearts with words on them and trade them back and forth,Mentalcomposer
basically make a cute romantic night in,Mentalcomposer
express to him how much you value him for him not for what he does for you,Mentalcomposer
his situation wont always be this way so support him as you would want him to support you if the roles were reversed,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
and congratulations  you should be so proud,Mentalcomposer
have you explained to your parents about the hs grad party and the sweet 16,Mentalcomposer
and why cant they just let you have this one thing that you are paying for on your own,Mentalcomposer
i would text all three of them and point these things out,Mentalcomposer
youre not asking for anything from any of them you just want to be celebrated once in your life for your accomplishments,Mentalcomposer
how they respond to the facts laid out in black and white should tell you all you need to know if they should be invited or not,Mentalcomposer
well done india,Mentalcomposer
lets look at the two people in this scenario in a 2 yr relationship that is not 100 solid,Mentalcomposer
you readily admit to mental health issues and what you are doing to help yourself get to a better place good for you in recognizing this should be your number 1 priority,Mentalcomposer
she on the other hand also has some mental health issues and is doing nothing to try to get to a better place,Mentalcomposer
now these mh issues have in some small way caused her to forget to take her pill thus contributing  not solely to the pregnancy it is totally possible that she could have taken the pill perfectly and still have a pregnancy but the chances are higher by her skipping pills,Mentalcomposer
do you really think that two 19 yos with mental health issues who cannot afford to support themselves are ready and able to care for and raise a baby,Mentalcomposer
that is the reasoning you needs to speak with his gf about the actual practicalities of raising this child not your immediate feelings not her immediate feelings the actual nitty gritty,Mentalcomposer
who is gonna work to support this little family you her both of you then who is gonna watch the baby if you two both work how are you going to afford daycare,Mentalcomposer
you both work now and still cant afford to move out of your parents house,Mentalcomposer
can either of you earn enough to support all 3 of you rent food utilities car payments doctors formula clothes etc,Mentalcomposer
it sounds so exciting to have a baby but the truth is its the hardest job in the world to raise a healthy happy well adjusted person because thats what you will be doing for the next 18 years,Mentalcomposer
and if you decide to have this baby please heed this  my very unscientific conclusion from fam and friends is that women are more fertile after having the first baby so lay off her  keep that in the back of your mind,Mentalcomposer
i have no opinion on what you and her should do i just think you both need a serious sit down to discuss the actual realities of having or not having this child,Mentalcomposer
have you explained to him that long explanations get lost on you that you physically cannot keep your attention on a long monologue,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure that eye contact is needed sometimes i have to picture what the other person is saying in order to get it,Mentalcomposer
ask him to break it up and check that youre following him,Mentalcomposer
for ex first i unscrew this got it then i take this part off making sure i dont scratch it got it  and on and on,Mentalcomposer
youll have to be honest tho when you dont get it and he may have to repeat himself but hell have to be understanding about that,Mentalcomposer
ah ok that clears up a lot,Mentalcomposer
i thought you lived with your bf family full time and that you havent been in touch with your dad for a while,Mentalcomposer
i am changing my judgement to yta just for asking bf to skip the wedding,Mentalcomposer
youre nta  for being upset that your bf didnt get a plus one id be upset at that for the fact that youre together a long time and additionally your bf is an adult and a plus one is usually how invites go for adults unless no other cousins were also  no plus ones,Mentalcomposer
im sorry if i came off as harsh wasnt my intention at all,Mentalcomposer
do you have any friends that you can spend that weekend with in your hometown that you can stay with,Mentalcomposer
you can avoid your dad and go visit your mom,Mentalcomposer
yta  maybe,Mentalcomposer
im confused as to why it takes you days to deal with your moms anniversary day,Mentalcomposer
i say this in a not mean way but in a you need to get a handle on it for your own mentally stable peace of mind,Mentalcomposer
please dont come at me yes i know everyone is different and people grieve in their own way,Mentalcomposer
i understand losing your mom was awful being young but you are an adult now and you need to find a way to deal with your feelings around this day without it seemingly being a multi day grief session that is not healthy in any way,Mentalcomposer
i lost my father as a grade schooler and my mom 10 years back so i am familiar with your feelings,Mentalcomposer
his fam saying you can just stay in the hotel is leading me to think theyve been around for this date prior and my thought that this is indeed a multi day thing is correct they may have been thinking you being alone isnt the best thing for you,Mentalcomposer
your bf will be home on the day of moms passing so thats not an issue,Mentalcomposer
he can support you however you need,Mentalcomposer
travel day is probably the next day on friday so you wont be in a happy jolly mood but you should be able to handle traveling,Mentalcomposer
the wedding is on sat emotionally you should be able to go to the wedding even if youre not the most excited there its a happy occasion so celebrate along,Mentalcomposer
your dads bday is tuesday and you will be home by then but you dont even talk to him so i dont know why this day would even be on your radar,Mentalcomposer
as far as the plus one,Mentalcomposer
that is a standard way of invited when being invited i dont know where you got the idea that you werent invited your bf is in the fam he gets a plus one hes bringing his gf,Mentalcomposer
there is a lot of emotional stuff surrounding these dates you need to talk to someone who can help you move past your grief and anger in regards to your family,Mentalcomposer
chocolate,Mentalcomposer
that weird chocolate truffle thing,Mentalcomposer
and when the father treats the white grand baby better than the step grand baby  his wife will be all  well its his blood grand baby,Mentalcomposer
this will not end well at all,Mentalcomposer
idk if her dad can change his views and mind but if hes not all in hes out,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
i think amy is trying to stick it to her mom for making her wear dresses as a kid,Mentalcomposer
anyway obviously the dress code is different but its amys wedding,Mentalcomposer
but youre not going to change amys mind so do yourself a favor and just go with it its one day and unless you want to lose your d and her wife you are going to have to bite the bullet here,Mentalcomposer
your wife can wear a pantsuit that has very wide flowy pant legs that basically look like youre wearing a dress,Mentalcomposer
something like this,Mentalcomposer
these would look lovely with a dressy blouse,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
your having a baby this april and getting married next year,Mentalcomposer
really by next year you will be perfectly ok with not taking a 1 yo on your honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
now to his child how long have you been together that you havent bonded with this child im not saying you have to fall head over heels for her instantly but by the time you marry this guy you should have stronger feeling then shes a nice little girl,Mentalcomposer
marrying a guy with kids means you will be another parental figure in her life if you arent willing to do that then you are doing all of you a huge disservice he will or at least should put his d first and that means if you dont get on board youll be the one sending your child for fortnight visits,Mentalcomposer
i hate the thought that his first d will always be less to you,Mentalcomposer
dont be that stepmom be better do better,Mentalcomposer
neither of these children should be going on the vacation that youre calling a honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
you realize waiting until you each get your fill of sex with other people over a few years is never going to happen,Mentalcomposer
i think you both have this romanticized idea in your heads that this is your person when clearly it is not,Mentalcomposer
you didnt like the sex with him but then had sex with 7 other guys  but only hooked up with 2 how does that work and hated all those experiences too now suddenly the sex with him is good could it be that you realize sex for the sake of having sex is not your thing and you actually need an emotional connection to a person not just an act,Mentalcomposer
whatever is going on with you two is not sex related,Mentalcomposer
so while you both will be out there meeting others one or most likely both of you will find someone else you will want to be with long term,Mentalcomposer
youll both mature change and find that the young love you have now is not the love that will sustain you for a lifetime,Mentalcomposer
if its just a matter of being with other people then pick a number that you think will satisfy this crazy idea and get it done now,Mentalcomposer
of course that has its own problems with jealousy what you did what he did and with who it will just cause more issues between you two and youll end up breaking up anyway,Mentalcomposer
just admit this relationship has run its course and move on,Mentalcomposer
if by chance you both happen to meet up in the future and it works out then great but this isnt something that you can or should plan your life around,Mentalcomposer
i love those shows  i look at the ingredients and think  no way theyll be able to incorporate like candy corn and somehow they do,Mentalcomposer
maybe her partner should spend his time watching and getting some ideas,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if hes such a great chef he can make great meals with whatever you buy,Mentalcomposer
like those cooking shows where they have to make something from random foods in a basket,Mentalcomposer
when he gets a job and contributes to the household he can buy and cook whatever he wants,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand why he cannot grasp this,Mentalcomposer
youre talking about a celebrity who she is in all likelihood never ever ever going to meet its like being jealous of a ghost,Mentalcomposer
and there is nothing wrong with finding strangers attractive,Mentalcomposer
look there was a time where i only had eyes for my partner would actively look around and try to find someone who caught my eye  not,Mentalcomposer
to cheat just to see if there was one,Mentalcomposer
and i couldnt find one,Mentalcomposer
did i think my partner never found anyone else attractive hell no  did i think there was anything wrong with me or them no i was secure enough in my partner to know i had nothing to worry about,Mentalcomposer
its all about trust work on yours,Mentalcomposer
it sort of seems that you might be a bit insecure but in a way that you think your partner is  i hate this expression out of your league,Mentalcomposer
shes with you she likes you enjoy it and as i said in my first post stop sweating the small stuff,Mentalcomposer
if you booked with an agent then the cruise line will not be able to discuss your booking it has to go thru the agent,Mentalcomposer
so call them first to cancel this way depending on how far off the trip is you will get refunded all or a portion of the cruise fare but you will get refunded any port taxes and fees and any other pre paid add ons,Mentalcomposer
next would be the travel insurance idk who or what policy you have but usually any 3rd party travel ins kicks in after your primary,Mentalcomposer
so your travel ins may just tell you to submit all bills later on after you have outstanding bills from what your primary did not cover,Mentalcomposer
hope your wife will be okay,Mentalcomposer
i was the last in the fam to get one and i only got my first one just because everyone else in my fam had one,Mentalcomposer
kept it because i cant even imagine trying to learn a new phone system,Mentalcomposer
i know thats a stupid reason,Mentalcomposer
i am very tech challenged  started with a 5 and my 8 is still doing just fine,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
he never even realized you dont shave and he never thought you were unhygienic before,Mentalcomposer
so his argument doesnt make sense,Mentalcomposer
that is the stupidest sentence i have ever read,Mentalcomposer
if youre uncomfortable when you dress for any occasion youre doing it wrong,Mentalcomposer
generally community colleges will let you enroll regardless of gpa,Mentalcomposer
unless there is an unusually weird amount of students enrolling that semester,Mentalcomposer
make an appointment with an admissions counselor at your local and see what they say,Mentalcomposer
they have seen  and heard it all and wont judge you they are there to help you,Mentalcomposer
be prepared to take a bunch of remedial classes to bring you up to have the skills for 100 level college classes,Mentalcomposer
but thats fine i did a few when i was a returning student they helped me refresh all the stuff i forgot years ago,Mentalcomposer
you can do this you just need to start,Mentalcomposer
best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
go to the financial aid office at your school explain everything to them and see if there are grants loans emergency aid that you can get,Mentalcomposer
see if you can be an ra in the dorms for this or next semester that way your room and maybe board will be covered,Mentalcomposer
you can still keep your job too,Mentalcomposer
how is no one realizing that this teacher is taking 20  4th grade 9 yos to a water park and is what,Mentalcomposer
letting them all go off on their own wherever,Mentalcomposer
water parks are dangerous no way any school ive ever had to deal with would allow that there would be parents going and assigned a group of kids to be responsible for,Mentalcomposer
as far as this situation i would have made sure my kid didnt have to babysit the boy no one likes and only if that wasnt done would i not let her go,Mentalcomposer
and i wouldnt have bought the vip tix for the same day id have done something else with my kid,Mentalcomposer
he has an older brother who is married and has a child,Mentalcomposer
someone said it is his step bro idk about that tho,Mentalcomposer
i do remember seeing her posts tho and the bro also posted about a scholarship or something i dont remember exactly,Mentalcomposer
if you were my d this is what i would tell you,Mentalcomposer
you have seen how he is for a whole year already  do you think he is going to suddenly wake up one day and be a considerate non yelling insulting bf,Mentalcomposer
do you think if you just try harder to please him 247 then he wont ever get mad at you and call you insulting names,Mentalcomposer
i am telling you right now,Mentalcomposer
that will never ever happen,Mentalcomposer
and that his not what being a partner is you dont change and compromise for anyone just so that wont get mad at you,Mentalcomposer
this is not love you dont love him he certainly does not love you,Mentalcomposer
get away from him now before he hurts you worse,Mentalcomposer
stop dating  im serious you are way too young that this is your second abusive bf,Mentalcomposer
you need to understand that you are worth way more than you have been getting having a bf is not the be all end all find a few good friends to spend your time with or hell be alone for a bit enjoy your own company find what makes you happy that isnt a boy,Mentalcomposer
see what good relationships look like and see what the crappy ones look like,Mentalcomposer
then when you know what behavior you expect from a guy you will be able to leave when the first bad behavior comes up,Mentalcomposer
so i just looked up port charges for gc here i didnt even know this  info was available but i took a shot and googled,Mentalcomposer
it cost 726 per person plus another 3675 for the ship,Mentalcomposer
so if we divide the 3675 by the number of passengers  idk what ship so lets say 3000 passengers that comes to 012 cents per person,Mentalcomposer
so 726 plus 02 thats 728 per person,Mentalcomposer
the 10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees,Mentalcomposer
ncl gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment,Mentalcomposer
the only problem i see is in the future which most people dont think about,Mentalcomposer
hes going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together,Mentalcomposer
think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo when you are 45 hell be closer to 60 hes not going to have the energy for it,Mentalcomposer
then dont discount his health you may find yourself being his carer and thats not an easy thing to do if youre in the midst of a career or are raising youngish kids or both at the same time,Mentalcomposer
i know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun and neither has any kids,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
she just started a new job and believe it or not its a difficult one,Mentalcomposer
not just physically but mentally and add to that the fact that im sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right,Mentalcomposer
all that combined is a recipe for exhaustion,Mentalcomposer
she needs time time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts her at home work down,Mentalcomposer
what she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesnt give him the amount of attention he wants,Mentalcomposer
id love to see what happens next year when youre up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out,Mentalcomposer
are you going to put off studying to hang out,Mentalcomposer
i didnt think so,Mentalcomposer
frankly you dont deserve her youre too selfish,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
i am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth,Mentalcomposer
its really not a big deal,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its a perfectly normal question to ask,Mentalcomposer
your friend is hiding something,Mentalcomposer
let me guess they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
just passing on what i saw,Mentalcomposer
the cd was in ops name effectively making it the legal property of op,Mentalcomposer
grandma verbally told op to give that one cd to nephew,Mentalcomposer
op emailed nephew nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold,Mentalcomposer
op told nephew whyd it take you so long but ok ill send the check but the original cd was cashed and spent in expenses so the  is coming from me personally,Mentalcomposer
nephew responds give me my money it shouldnt take this long oh and send it to my dad,Mentalcomposer
ops lawyer advised since the cd was never in nephews name nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will op legally doesnt  have to give nephew any money,Mentalcomposer
i think i heard costa rica mentioned but idk where i got that from so its not very helpful,Mentalcomposer
and theres nothing on the costa rica reditt either so im starting to think there isnt another one,Mentalcomposer
i saw a retired military somebody on fox  dont slam me they carried the shoot down live who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed and the military talked him out of it,Mentalcomposer
this guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command,Mentalcomposer
so i think theres more to this whole incident than we know,Mentalcomposer
yes i keep trying to find one news source about that balloon,Mentalcomposer
i cant find anything other than a blip that said us military was aware of one,Mentalcomposer
very strange,Mentalcomposer
this is what youre unhappy about,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt tell you youre cute or pretty every day,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt call you by your nickname,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt ask you how youre doing,Mentalcomposer
he hasnt asked you on a date since fall,Mentalcomposer
he says hes not good at planning,Mentalcomposer
you have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for,Mentalcomposer
im sorry but you seem a bit insecure are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you,Mentalcomposer
that might be why youre going through rough patches you expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe thats just not him its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off,Mentalcomposer
thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something but you want him to do all the work why cant you plan a date,Mentalcomposer
so see youre doing fine youre covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through,Mentalcomposer
just pay close attention over the next say 6 months if hes serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids slowly at first and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together thats a big tell to me about his intentions,Mentalcomposer
ooh his wife asked for the divorce,Mentalcomposer
ill throw this out just cause i want you to think about things you wouldnt think of,Mentalcomposer
some men just cannot be alone his wife ending things regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward and im not saying he wants back with her im sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble,Mentalcomposer
im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit,Mentalcomposer
ok so i think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy as opposed to him who im gonna guess sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent,Mentalcomposer
so hes dealing with guilt of hurting the ex guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you its been a year so hes probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up  which really was a stupid thing to do the parents havent been together for a year why make this trip why not just one of the parents take the kids why this charadehas hampered his moving on but the trip will be done he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in,Mentalcomposer
also realize that his kids will always always cone first you will not have what you did in your marriage where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be plans will be ruined if theres an issue with the kids and you have to be  ok with that,Mentalcomposer
its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that,Mentalcomposer
if after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions,Mentalcomposer
but for the next few days while hes gone do something for yourself to occupy your time it might be better if you two dont talk so much a check in is enough you dont want to get jealous and he doesnt want to temper what he says to you,Mentalcomposer
and another excellent point to make,Mentalcomposer
this thread is so fascinating with all the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me,Mentalcomposer
info please,Mentalcomposer
hes separated yes  as in living apart but not with you from his soon to be ex wife seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on,Mentalcomposer
oh and there was no cheating by either of you,Mentalcomposer
then i can weigh in better,Mentalcomposer
id agree with that if  china had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted,Mentalcomposer
so they have a few weather balloon malfunctions possible if theyre trying something new and perfectly reasonable but just come out and say that before it enters into another countrys airspace,Mentalcomposer
if they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it,Mentalcomposer
even then we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force,Mentalcomposer
but until it comes down or gets forced down we wont know what it actually is and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities,Mentalcomposer
as i originally said i would have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another countrys airspace any country china should have said just that instead they said nothing,Mentalcomposer
now its possible they tried to play that story with either the us or canadian govt before it was spotted by whoever spotted it first but neither govt has said that was the case,Mentalcomposer
being that they didnt just leads me to believe that it wasnt just a wayward science balloon not to mention that theres another one and this one just traversed the country and is now over the carolinas where i believe we have large military bases  could be wrong,Mentalcomposer
theres no doubt that most govts dont trust china but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil china theories,Mentalcomposer
ill believe the us and canada before i believe anything china says and thats just based in history not just anti china anything,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
have you spoken to his bf and explained why hes not invited,Mentalcomposer
brother might be feeling its a rejection of him his bf but bf might just see the rationale,Mentalcomposer
as long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity he should understand and help to calm your bros thinking,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
are you freakin kidding,Mentalcomposer
your son has been bullied and when he finally defends himself  not start not instigate but defends himself you actually think its ok to punish him more,Mentalcomposer
you are the absolute worst,Mentalcomposer
give me a break about this one instance ruining his future no college gives a rats azz about one suspension that can very easily be explained away,Mentalcomposer
those parents want to press charges let them and counter sue for harassment,Mentalcomposer
line up every single instance that your son has been bullied by these two over the years and absolutely obliterate them in court,Mentalcomposer
be a better advocate for your son,Mentalcomposer
hes needed you in his corner for years and you havent stepped up,Mentalcomposer
do it now,Mentalcomposer
im so disgusted by you and i dont even know you,Mentalcomposer
never heard that,Mentalcomposer
ok ill wait for a third to show up somewhere else too,Mentalcomposer
i might believe the balloon somehow got blown way off course,Mentalcomposer
if there wasnt another one over south america,Mentalcomposer
two just seems a little too much of a coincidence,Mentalcomposer
i guess it might be possible both balloons got caught up in the same winds or jet stream but eh,Mentalcomposer
im not sure that your love language actually is physical touch,Mentalcomposer
im thinking that you are just starving for some type of physical touch being that from your description of family you havent ever had much much of it,Mentalcomposer
explain to your gf this and let her know its not necessarily sex that youre looking for its more non sexual physical touch and closeness,Mentalcomposer
so you can hold hands while sitting next to each other while watching tv you want to rub her arm or leg if youre just lounging around youd like a hug hello or goodbye make sure shes ok with this level of touch tho,Mentalcomposer
see if thats what youre really looking for it will satisfy you and take the pressure your gf is feeling off,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
her wanting to spend money you dont have is exactly why she is in debt,Mentalcomposer
you cleared yours probably by being diligent and prioritizing spending while she seems like shes a bit more carefree financially,Mentalcomposer
you two need to discuss finances in brutal detail and figure out if youre compatible on this topic,Mentalcomposer
as a couple you both should know whats going on with the finances and recognize that even though it may be an occasion sometimes its just not a good time to spend more,Mentalcomposer
she knows about all the expenses you told us about how can she expect to spend another 700 for 1 night,Mentalcomposer
i said it before they want the rf to admit to,Mentalcomposer
an unconscious bias in the monarchy as well as a plan to eradicate it,Mentalcomposer
they want then to admit they didnt do enough to stop bad press of tw,Mentalcomposer
even if her actions whatever they were were truthfully reported,Mentalcomposer
then they want an apology for the above two things and to admit that the stupid duo were right about everything they claim  even tho they havent laid out any concrete proof,Mentalcomposer
they wont get any of it because its all,Mentalcomposer
delusions of two disturbed people,Mentalcomposer
did you pay with a credit card,Mentalcomposer
sone cards have some level of insurance,Mentalcomposer
check that,Mentalcomposer
i totally understand keeping separate but what happens when for instance you have a baby and one of you stay home,Mentalcomposer
id imagine it would feel a little weird not having your own acct of money,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine the working spouse not being ok with the sahp having access to their acct but i was curious,Mentalcomposer
anybody experience that and what did you do,Mentalcomposer
im sorry you are going thru this,Mentalcomposer
but nows the time to be mad not sad,Mentalcomposer
much easier to forget all about him when youre so mad at what he put you thru,Mentalcomposer
so turn your thinking around be grateful you only spent 3 years with him and you have the best thing to come out of your relationship your d,Mentalcomposer
it shows just how invested he was that hes going away with his friends instead of trying to get you and his d back  be mad about that,Mentalcomposer
he has an addiction but tries to blame it in you as if you drove him to the compulsion he has nope be pissed about that too,Mentalcomposer
he lied for years get mad about that,Mentalcomposer
you are going to have an amazing life and youre gonna do it all by yourself you dont need him,Mentalcomposer
so i guess serious humanitarian content highlighting their save the world complex is out,Mentalcomposer
great one more thing they wont get right as they know nothing about romance or comedy,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand who the victim is,Mentalcomposer
my point was trying to say that she has a preconceived notion of what this country is like and the only way he may get her to change that is to show her sounds reasonable to me,Mentalcomposer
she may go and hate it but at least she was there to make an informed decision by him cancelling the trip he may have in her mind validated what she has been thinking all this time she can then think to herself see he knows its awful thats why he gave up trying to get me to go,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt say he has to cure her of anything more like getting her to be more open to exploring something out of her comfort zone its been over 10 years maybe just putting up with her for another month wouldnt have been the worst thing,Mentalcomposer
a mid range mobile will do the same things as a high end one talk text and data,Mentalcomposer
what else would you use it for youre not really gonna be able to do schoolwork on it,Mentalcomposer
so go better on the laptop,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
i also think it depends on how often you are trying to get the guys together,Mentalcomposer
something every weekend thats not gonna happen no mom wants the dad out having fun every weekend while she gets child care duty,Mentalcomposer
something like a dart league is a weekly commitment most working people  not just dads are probably reluctant to commit to that  as its just another thing to add to the list of somewhere i have to be on that night every week,Mentalcomposer
instead of just trying to get the guys together invite the couples over with their kids to watch a game play a game or even just to hang out,Mentalcomposer
the guys only should be an occasional thing,Mentalcomposer
he had the side with the outlet for the alarm clock since he got up first,Mentalcomposer
then we had to switch cause the baby cradle only fit on that side of the bed its been that way ever since,Mentalcomposer
honestly you sound so desperate to find a partner and that desperation will become apparent to anyone you happen to meet thats not a good thing,Mentalcomposer
you need to figure out why you feel that the only way to be happy is with a partner,Mentalcomposer
there are always times in everyones life where they are single that in itself should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be,Mentalcomposer
go out with friends join a club pick up a new hobby do something anything just for yourself something that you enjoy,Mentalcomposer
stop expecting someone else to make you happy,Mentalcomposer
youre so young enjoy this time of your life your person will come at the right time,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt want to date you anymore thats the reason,Mentalcomposer
but youre gonna hang on waiting for him to come up with some kind of problem or issue he has with you or your relationship and think together you can fix it did you ever think he doesnt want to fix it whatever it is if there even is a thing,Mentalcomposer
or theres no fixable reason he outgrew the relationship hes bored youre not what he wants anymore he met another and wants to pursue her but wont cheat on you so he breaks up,Mentalcomposer
just move on stop trying to figure it out hes not worth any more aggravation youll make yourself crazy,Mentalcomposer
agree totally,Mentalcomposer
why would she or anybody really fight for and want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with them,Mentalcomposer
ive always had that attitude which is why i get over heart break pretty easily  first im hurt and upset then i realize they dont want me so i just move on,Mentalcomposer
which is what op should be doing,Mentalcomposer
yeah but theres something about seeing a foreign country with a native,Mentalcomposer
thats when and how you see all the great local things on offer,Mentalcomposer
its just sad she wont experience thatespecially with you her h,Mentalcomposer
but you wont convince her if she never goes there,Mentalcomposer
best thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things she moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didnt convince her,Mentalcomposer
she needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down,Mentalcomposer
but also shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there,Mentalcomposer
oh ok then itll be fine,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to do anything,Mentalcomposer
let it cool id wash it and youre good,Mentalcomposer
dont touch it till it cools off,Mentalcomposer
if there was nothing in the pan what happened to the pan,Mentalcomposer
have you told him you dont feel like you two are connecting since youve had the kids,Mentalcomposer
you need to sit him down and lay it all out,Mentalcomposer
tell him he has to decide what his priorities are is it you and the kids or his sailing,Mentalcomposer
if its his family then he needs to be present not just for the kids but for you as a woman and his wife,Mentalcomposer
explain he cannot possibly be giving his all to  his job his kids his wife and his hobby something gets pushed to the back burner and you feel like its you and that needs to change,Mentalcomposer
not a threat just a statement of fact youre not getting what you need from him and if youre not then why should he even be there,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and you admit its not 100 so why are you still there,Mentalcomposer
this should be the honeymoon phase where everything is great 2 ppl finding out everything about the other sharing stories of their lives their families etc,Mentalcomposer
not constant back and forth push and pull,Mentalcomposer
please find someone closer to your age in the same stage of life as you thinking about and going thru the same things as you,Mentalcomposer
youll find it a much easier happier relationship,Mentalcomposer
i didnt go away to uni but dont most people have a roommate or 2 or 3,Mentalcomposer
i would think you start there youre all in the same boat not knowing anyone so you pal around with the few you do know,Mentalcomposer
you can expand that into the others on your floor i heard keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way i guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi idk,Mentalcomposer
then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way,Mentalcomposer
eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends,Mentalcomposer
you should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when hes never even met you,Mentalcomposer
that screams scam to me,Mentalcomposer
you dont say how long youve been together but i would delay moving in,Mentalcomposer
yes we all did,Mentalcomposer
but youve been with him for 2 years,Mentalcomposer
that alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him if you do not then why on earth would you have moved in with him,Mentalcomposer
you have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to put up with your constant insecurity forever,Mentalcomposer
thats not how a relationship works you trust until they give you a reason not to and he hasnt so count your blessings stop looking for drama and have a stress free life with the guy who wants to be with you,Mentalcomposer
stop this you are way too old for this kind of stuff,Mentalcomposer
even if the bag is back in there do you really think his 11 yo son even wants them heres a clue no he doesnt,Mentalcomposer
oh silly me  i totally discounted the happy part,Mentalcomposer
i hope op updates as each of your timelines comes to fruition,Mentalcomposer
oh come on shes actually going to make you move out over a guy who she just met,Mentalcomposer
thats ridiculous  whats he gonna want next,Mentalcomposer
she needs to tell b that he hasnt been around long enough to start dictating who or what she can do with her apt and her life,Mentalcomposer
have a chat with a shes acting irrational over a guy,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine how hed act if there was a big problem,Mentalcomposer
perfectly fine take a class as an elective on what may interest you and youll find it,Mentalcomposer
you are someones perfect person you just havent met him yet,Mentalcomposer
do not settle for anyone who is not all in for you,Mentalcomposer
you will get over this one and move on to someone better,Mentalcomposer
congratulations  you earned it,Mentalcomposer
what are you thinking of studying,Mentalcomposer
you will do great,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of,Mentalcomposer
wow and your dad has nothing to say about that  hes the biggest ah of  them all,Mentalcomposer
sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom,Mentalcomposer
you need a little chat with dad about what she said,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of,Mentalcomposer
wow and your dad has nothing to say about that  hes the biggest ah of  them all,Mentalcomposer
sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom,Mentalcomposer
you need a little chat with dad about what she said,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses,Mentalcomposer
its one thing to spend time with a so its another when shes there for days at a time,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason she should be freeloading off you three,Mentalcomposer
you need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there and if shes visiting she doesnt get to crank the ac eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home not that she can hang around all day while hes at work,Mentalcomposer
someone correct me if im wrong please and ill delete this,Mentalcomposer
i think the point is that piers got fired from what i think was a pretty big morning news show when he dared to say probably amongst other things that he didnt believe what m claims,Mentalcomposer
so the fact that he was in a sense markled  lost his livelihood and now hes back because he has an interview with the pm which is a big deal,Mentalcomposer
a couple of things off the top of my head,Mentalcomposer
if you can wait until after labor day a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids,Mentalcomposer
idk how big the ship you mentioned is but i would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesnt like crowds id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less there may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has,Mentalcomposer
we just returned from a carnival cruise  out of miami and there were a bunch  of lgbt couples and groups i dont know if it was the ship  celebration very big or the port or that ccl has lgbt meet ups on all their ships which is attractive to the demographic but i didnt see or hear anything disparaging  i realize im one person so that doesnt mean much,Mentalcomposer
this might cone off the wrong way,Mentalcomposer
but i dont know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends its absolutely not my intention idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife  see this part i didnt know how to phrase who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting,Mentalcomposer
i know people hate carnival but ive been on them and ncl and really enjoy both lines carnival has really fun deck parties,Mentalcomposer
id go back anyway i cant possibly have another accident right yup im going with that,Mentalcomposer
we have 3 more booked for later this year,Mentalcomposer
but yeah it seems they arent gonna bill me which works for me  saves me from dealing with the insurance company,Mentalcomposer
seriously needing evac is my absolute worst fear,Mentalcomposer
being so badly hurt that  they want me off the ship is terrifying,Mentalcomposer
yeah had to do the report also,Mentalcomposer
they even took pics of my sneakers which i sort of understand in a weird way,Mentalcomposer
i would like to think its so they can see if theres a pattern to where and how accidents happen idk,Mentalcomposer
thats what i was thinking since it happened on the ship,Mentalcomposer
sounds like me hurt on day 2 it def put a damper on the vacation,Mentalcomposer
im sorry your dad went thru that,Mentalcomposer
its scary when youre away from home and dealing with medical issues,Mentalcomposer
thats what i expected to happen its just really odd that they havent charged me yet,Mentalcomposer
i have allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if i do have to claim,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah i def misunderstood your comment,Mentalcomposer
sorry,Mentalcomposer
ill just wait and see what happens,Mentalcomposer
that is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance,Mentalcomposer
it covers the usual trip cxl and delay lost baggage etc but i got it mainly for medical and evacuation,Mentalcomposer
i tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle so really not their fault not my fault just a misstep  i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers it was just a freak thing,Mentalcomposer
they did tell me upfront that they dont take insurance which i knew and what all the charges would be for the doc and xrays after that i didnt really care what the charge was for  the cast just do what needs to be done,Mentalcomposer
i did have to speak to security for an accident report maybe that has some bearing also idk,Mentalcomposer
i figured theyd put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc,Mentalcomposer
i guess ill just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point its been 6 days since i went to medical but only 2 days since debark,Mentalcomposer
thanks yeah my bill will def be higher than that so it cant be a threshold thing,Mentalcomposer
i was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did weird,Mentalcomposer
nailed it in one,Mentalcomposer
perfect,Mentalcomposer
im a bit confused,Mentalcomposer
what exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad,Mentalcomposer
the only clue i got was you feel uncomfortable and  or unwanted by him is this a result of the pregnancy is it a weight issue or what,Mentalcomposer
no way in hell would i ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor that will only give her more ammunition,Mentalcomposer
you have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said,Mentalcomposer
her baby is small she has to find something to brag about,Mentalcomposer
both these babies are under a year old do i believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles idk i guess its possible will he continue on that same path who knows,Mentalcomposer
dont engage her at all if she makes any kind of off comment ask her straight up what shes trying to say put her on the spot,Mentalcomposer
i was going to point this out,Mentalcomposer
hes using the majority of the food budget on his food and she has to basically eat whatever fits the budget,Mentalcomposer
thats some bs right there,Mentalcomposer
op make a new plan that takes food out of the shared acct each of you will then pay for your own food order for the week,Mentalcomposer
thats the only fair way he cannot hog the food budget and then make you feel bad that he has to add more money to it let him see exactly how much of that budget he has been spending,Mentalcomposer
and stop eating crap food you work you can afford to feed yourself whatever you damn well want to eat,Mentalcomposer
this is some serious next level shit with the sister,Mentalcomposer
i agree your h should be the one to shut his sister down every time,Mentalcomposer
but if hes not around heres some ideas,Mentalcomposer
her baby is younger it is not supposed to and is not going to be at the same developmental point as any other baby born before it including yours,Mentalcomposer
how to deal with her  every single time she tries to make comparisons between babies just repeat  oh im positive both  kids will reach every milestone when they reach it no rush,Mentalcomposer
or something to that affect,Mentalcomposer
do not engage in the tit for tat  her baby does this so you point out yours did or dies that,Mentalcomposer
all that will do is make her compare more,Mentalcomposer
just be very meh about everything she may just get tired of goading you when she sees you wont engage,Mentalcomposer
of course she may double down and get mean or snarky about you your baby or your relationship ship with your h in that case she went overboard and you are allowed to let loose on her,Mentalcomposer
this is what i think they want,Mentalcomposer
the family to make a statement admitting to some kind of,Mentalcomposer
unconscious bias within the monarchy along with a pledge to stop it,Mentalcomposer
an apology for not making sure the press didnt print anything disparaging against his wife in other words for not protecting her,Mentalcomposer
to be brought back to their half in half out as a way for the fam to make amends for being proven right about their accusations,Mentalcomposer
of course none of this will ever happen but the two of them somehow will keep pushing and pushing until they are proven right,Mentalcomposer
but they havent proven any of the accusations they have made so i dont know how they think their delusions will ever come to fruition,Mentalcomposer
they absolutely have no leverage against the family,Mentalcomposer
ive been out of the loop for the last 2 weeks so im not even sure where their support or popularity is at this point but if its low after all the interviews and his book they should seriously be looking at just working quietly on their humanitarian work if there really is any  and stop trying to get a pat on the back every time they deign to speak about any subject,Mentalcomposer
the thing is the only real choice you have in that instance is whether you are going to be involved in the childs life,Mentalcomposer
the mom can take you to court for child support and then you will be required to pay every month for the upkeep of the child,Mentalcomposer
so if youre going to be paying anyway you might as well just be involved,Mentalcomposer
that child will grow up and might come looking for you what possible explanation can you have for never being involved,Mentalcomposer
you were too young well you werent always that young,Mentalcomposer
you werent ready to be a dad well she probably wasnt ready either but she did it anyway,Mentalcomposer
it seems so easy to just walk away but will you really be able to just forget that your child is out there somewhere maybe not having a great childhood because you just couldnt be bothered to take any responsibility,Mentalcomposer
that is awesome,Mentalcomposer
great job,Mentalcomposer
how big is it,Mentalcomposer
she wasnt technically stripped of us citizenship she was never supposed to have it  if she legit ever did,Mentalcomposer
she is still a yemeni citizen because her father was a diplomat of yemen,Mentalcomposer
maybe she should ask yemen to let her in,Mentalcomposer
too bad so sad stay where you are,Mentalcomposer
jellyrolls is a dueling piano bar thats a fun night out,Mentalcomposer
the abracadabar is nice for a drink or two,Mentalcomposer
i think the boardwalk has brought back the entertainment could be a magician juggler etc they set up and put on a show for a bit,Mentalcomposer
theres a few boardwalk games for a fee basketball throw hit the lobster into the pot water gun race,Mentalcomposer
so basically walk the boardwalk and see what appeals to you,Mentalcomposer
we absolutely love the boardwalk  enjoy,Mentalcomposer
idk why but i like this question,Mentalcomposer
originally h took the side with the outlet for the alarm clock cause he had to get up earlier than me,Mentalcomposer
then we moved and kept the same sides until the baby came then we had to switch cause the bassinet only fit next to his side of the bed,Mentalcomposer
we just havent switched back,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
all you accomplished was to make your d and h mad at you and made your d miss her sisters wedding,Mentalcomposer
im not a fan of the emo look but thats what your d likes,Mentalcomposer
she put the dress on and added what she needed to be comfortable in it thigh high slits are fine on a formal dress have you seen what sweet 16 and prom dresses look like i just would have wanted it to be finished not just a scissor slit if thats what it was,Mentalcomposer
no one was going to care some ppl might have looked at her commented to their so and then went on with the festivities,Mentalcomposer
i highly doubt your d was planning on parading around the hall so everyone could see how edgy she was,Mentalcomposer
but bower says it was violet that set them up,Mentalcomposer
if the story about the insta crap was true why would she send violet flowers,Mentalcomposer
i have a 2 problems with scobies,Mentalcomposer
if im following this correctly,Mentalcomposer
the timeline,Mentalcomposer
h says the baby was already born when the in labor statement was made,Mentalcomposer
ok but did h or m even ever tell anyone that she was in labor,Mentalcomposer
so for him to be all butt hurt that it was a lie was actually his own damn fault for not telling anyone,Mentalcomposer
i am sure if the palace was told shes in labor they would have released that at that time,Mentalcomposer
so the fact that she labored gave birth and was already home by the time the in labor statement came out points to me that they purposefully withheld that info from anyone,Mentalcomposer
he wanted no press so he got no press so why bitch about it,Mentalcomposer
the fact checking,Mentalcomposer
he says there were things he didnt put in the book that were told by the place but couldnt be fact checked so he left them out ok that would be a good thing,Mentalcomposer
but when told by the harkens people about the titles he took that at face value and reported they didnt want title for archie so no additional fact checks in that one,Mentalcomposer
so he takes what their comms team says as fact and it turns out to be false but doesnt take the palaces statements as fact of course we dont know which ones they are because we have to wait for his second stupid ass book as if theres some big revelation to be revealed,Mentalcomposer
this is exactly where im at even commenting that we really should do ncl more we even have 2 cruise next certs that we have to use at some point,Mentalcomposer
i really like ncl but the ccl offers are just too good to pass up and as you say the diff is pretty small,Mentalcomposer
i also like that i can see my ccl offers online and dont have to call to find out what they are,Mentalcomposer
with ncl i have to call they look up my acct and tell me what my offer is then since its a casino offer i have to pay that extra 20 pp per day admin fee and honestly for the time and money spent in the casino on ncl my offers arent that good,Mentalcomposer
so ill stick with ccl until i find an itinerary on ncl that i cant get on ccl,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its a ridiculous caveat on the trust,Mentalcomposer
is it even legal what if it stated you had to marry a certain woman could that be upheld,Mentalcomposer
but really you should have never confided in your sib,Mentalcomposer
should have made like you were cheating kept the ruse going pretend fight and then make up,Mentalcomposer
now sib is gonna tell the lawyer and theres gonna be issues or not the lawyer might think its a ridiculous rule too and just overlook it can they do that,Mentalcomposer
im guessing this is about knees,Mentalcomposer
and even an obese person needs those to walk,Mentalcomposer
painful knees while walking leads to less walking leads to weight gain,Mentalcomposer
sometimes its just a vicious never ending cycle,Mentalcomposer
what if that painful knee was from a horrific accident that had someone laid up in a hospital for months should they have not eaten all that time to not gain any weight,Mentalcomposer
dont judge you probably have no idea what someone has been through,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
its not for you to decide they are the parents and they can figure out their own stuff,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure you just ruined your relationship with your future sil,Mentalcomposer
the most logical solution is to move game night for the boys to brothers house,Mentalcomposer
he keeps the kids and does what he needs to do in between playing,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt even have to play he can just hang out with the guys,Mentalcomposer
but at least everything he needs is in his own home,Mentalcomposer
and his wife gets a needed time off to enjoy something just for herself,Mentalcomposer
who knows he might even get some help with the twins if they both wake at the same time,Mentalcomposer
nta for not wanting to spend v day as a double date,Mentalcomposer
but  she really didnt do anything wrong to you personally,Mentalcomposer
her parents enabled her and now her bf has to put up with her,Mentalcomposer
just tell your wife you want to spend the day with just her thats kind of the point if that particular holiday,Mentalcomposer
how did they even know you commented here,Mentalcomposer
do they go and look at every single person who has ever been on that site every day to see what they post,Mentalcomposer
sorry if this is a stupid q i dont understand,Mentalcomposer
she cannot possibly think any kind of project that has anything to do with her time in the rf can help to worm herself back in,Mentalcomposer
if anything the shut door will now be padlocked,Mentalcomposer
youre assuming that anyone else knew,Mentalcomposer
its not hard to announce a pregnancy use the moon bumps all along tell someone she went into labor when the surrogate actually did and then present the baby,Mentalcomposer
do we know that she saw a royal dr and theres that weird remark from h that babies grow so much in2 weeks when they showed him publicly,Mentalcomposer
and for all we know they could have contracted with a surrogate in a legal country,Mentalcomposer
idk where i stand on the real or fake pregnancies but i wouldnt put it past them to lie to everyone precisely because of the los issue gotta get that sweet sweet royal heritage,Mentalcomposer
oh i totally agree we were young  2326,Mentalcomposer
im happy to say it worked out tho 33 years 3 independent kids who are in no rush to marry and were retired,Mentalcomposer
we made it work but we also were done with school had a house and waited 4 years to start our family,Mentalcomposer
everyone has to do what works for them i would never tell anyone to do what we did just because we did it,Mentalcomposer
so you shouldnt,Mentalcomposer
its actually very smart to wait if its for your education i believe that a masters program only comes with a small stipend to live on so how exactly would you and a wife who im assuming is close to your age going to support a household,Mentalcomposer
and of course the girl is going to be traditional also  and is going to want to have children too the pressure from both families would be unbearable,Mentalcomposer
stick to your decision i could not even imagine being married that young  and i married at 23 but we were both already in our careers,Mentalcomposer
its not a big deal thats the point,Mentalcomposer
h just wants to make it seem like it is,Mentalcomposer
you know cause his witch of a wife is just so caring she would be able to comfort everyone  while taking copious notes on everyone and everything for her tell all,Mentalcomposer
i have found that the best way for me to retain info is to write it down,Mentalcomposer
so in class take notes,Mentalcomposer
and then when you have to actually study for a test re write what you need to know organize it so it makes sense to you,Mentalcomposer
the act of writing it helps to retain it,Mentalcomposer
nta for initially being angry but at this point when she brings it up youve got to not engage with her,Mentalcomposer
just tell her youre not having this convo again its done and over and she can either get over it or get out,Mentalcomposer
why did she go thru your phone,Mentalcomposer
7 mo in she has no right to info about your money,Mentalcomposer
if she lost all trust in you then that was the time to break up,Mentalcomposer
youve been rocky since then so you have to decide if this is what you want or not,Mentalcomposer
any relationship that is that much strife and aggravation isnt worth it to me,Mentalcomposer
i didnt mean to disparage your step mom but its human nature for her to prioritize her bio kids,Mentalcomposer
its worth at least a convo with your dad,Mentalcomposer
dont ask questions you dont want the answer to  especially during sex with your wife never mind you going soft i would have kicked you out of the bed,Mentalcomposer
but really what she did  with her time and body before being committed to you is none of your concern,Mentalcomposer
you are a grown man stop pouting that you didnt get the girl first,Mentalcomposer
you were gone for years was she supposed to sit home pining for you,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see is that even if you are still contributing your 50 share to expenses that money is coming out of somewhere either your savings or your retirement funds,Mentalcomposer
great that you have them but at some point they will run short or be depleted,Mentalcomposer
at that time you will be expecting your partner to pay all expenses,Mentalcomposer
do you realistically have enough of your own independent money to support half of this household for another 30 years because you very well could live that long,Mentalcomposer
your combined cash and investments seems like a lot but half of that  lets say your half if its evenly contributed is 750000,Mentalcomposer
750000 divided over 30 years is only 25000 per year obviously with no growth,Mentalcomposer
is that enough for you to cover your half for 30 yrs,Mentalcomposer
how about when your partner retires will your own money be enough to travel if you feel like or to do whatever you two have talked about,Mentalcomposer
you need to add some income to this partnership if you want it to remain happy and healthy,Mentalcomposer
yea you should bring it up to your dad,Mentalcomposer
not in a confrontational way but more in a maybe he doesnt realize this way,Mentalcomposer
he might be under the impression that step mom would be a decent person and split the inheritance when she passes equally when there isnt any guarantee of that,Mentalcomposer
point out that the majority of his and wifes assets are from him  and not her,Mentalcomposer
ask him if hed be ok with his bio kids being totally cut out when step mom passes and does he really think shed have any sense of loyalty to kids that arent hers,Mentalcomposer
the most equitable way is for him to leave half to step mom if he predeceases her and half to his bio kids,Mentalcomposer
then step mom can divvy up her assets to her kids when she passes,Mentalcomposer
you say he didnt want another child and left his ex wife to completely raise his younger son by herself,Mentalcomposer
does this mean that he is involved with the first one,Mentalcomposer
yes thats what it means the ship wont actually leave cape town till 4 on sat and then you dock in richards bay on tuesday and the boat leaves the next day at 9 pm so you can usually stay out as late as you want before returning to the ship to sleep,Mentalcomposer
im not sure how embark would be tho do you actually have to board as usual which would mean be on board at least 2 hrs prior to departure timedo the muster and then are free to get off and explore  of course usually people get in the ship way before the 2 hrs prior,Mentalcomposer
might just want to ask that you dont want to show up at 5 pm with your bags and check in was meant to be done earlier,Mentalcomposer
just leave her alone about this topic,Mentalcomposer
shes 19 a lot can change as she gets older,Mentalcomposer
im surprised one day with kids did it actually most people would have the attitude of my kids wont be like that or recognize 4 kids is too many,Mentalcomposer
maybe shes actually onto your little ploy and is screwing with you that would be hysterical,Mentalcomposer
that quote from your dad is great,Mentalcomposer
im filing that away to use if i need it,Mentalcomposer
you are being completely irrational on this issue,Mentalcomposer
they dont see each other on a regular basis they live far away from each other so im guessing at this point they phone or text each other probably when theres something to say other than an ongoing keeping up with each others lives,Mentalcomposer
why is this one person so threatening to you  im sure theres other people that your bf has dated or hooked up with in the same city you live in where it would be more probable that you would run into,Mentalcomposer
could it be that you are jealous that he has such a lifelong friend who probably knows more about your bf than you do k knows everything your bf has done and thought since grade school its not a nice thought that someone else knows your partner that well but its also a testament that your bf can keep a relationship going for so long thats good for you in the long run,Mentalcomposer
your bf may say hell be ok cutting contact but somewhere in his mind hes going to be sad that his one constant in his life is gone that might lead to him unconsciously resenting you because youre the reason for that severing of ties,Mentalcomposer
you should meet k with a complete open mind you may hate him for legit reasons or you may just find that hes a genuinely good friend to your bf and your fears whatever they are will be alleviated,Mentalcomposer
a lot for you to think about here but dont borrow problems that arent there,Mentalcomposer
that age gap its gonna become a gaping chasm,Mentalcomposer
i have a friend who married with a 20 year gap she was spry and adventurous into her late 40s bad knees got her he was all but housebound happy to stay home with the pets he was tired and the health issues started cropping up,Mentalcomposer
thats what youll get caring for a 70 year old at 50 and if you have kids,Mentalcomposer
youll have a 70 yo h and a teenager,Mentalcomposer
hes a 50 yo mean man with health issues who thinks he hit the jackpot,Mentalcomposer
with his much younger gf,Mentalcomposer
and what do you get out of this you get to be his nursemaid when his ills come up and you get to take the brunt of his nastiness,Mentalcomposer
cut your losses find someone closer to your age and in the same stage of life you two can grow old and sickly together but hed probably be a lot nicer to you,Mentalcomposer
who are the same forces that are controlling j epstein,Mentalcomposer
i thought he was top of the food chain,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
youre n t a for wanting bro out but,Mentalcomposer
i have a diff take,Mentalcomposer
your h bot the house are you an owner also i understand being married but it will make a big diff to bil if you tell him whats gonna happen the whole fam will be told you threw him out and its not even your house  just saying what bil will say not that its true,Mentalcomposer
you are more than expected to shut him down with any rude comments he may make and shut him down hard find anything you can that he may be sensitive about and use it,Mentalcomposer
but your  h is the one who should be handling his brother as far as moving out you and him have to get on the same page and he needs to deliver it to bro,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
he needs to find a new psych  and get his own prescription and if he has no insurance hes going to have to it for the visits,Mentalcomposer
its ridiculous that youre sharing medicine one of these months you are going to really need it and its not going to be there then its gonna be a big problem,Mentalcomposer
and if hes taking 3 a day how many are left for you its nice that you might not need all of it but why should you not have it when you do need it,Mentalcomposer
thats fair sorry i was trying to see if theres a pattern of behavior,Mentalcomposer
you know him best think back and ask yourself,Mentalcomposer
is this how he always was,Mentalcomposer
if yes then in a way you allowed him to think youd always do the work and hed benefit from it,Mentalcomposer
then a division of chores needs to be struck and he has to agree to then if he doesnt theres your answer he will not ever change,Mentalcomposer
if he used to be a more involved partner,Mentalcomposer
then you need to figure out what happened that he suddenly took a turn for the worse,Mentalcomposer
do a huge self reflection on the whole of your relationship thru all of it see if there were things you missed or you overlooked thinking hed be better or do better as time went on,Mentalcomposer
youre so young and its scary when your life is not turning out how you thought it would  it can get better but he has to be willing and he at 27 should be acting like a h and father instead hes acting like a teenager who has a part time job for gas money,Mentalcomposer
do not be afraid to break up if you think its the best for everyone involved including your baby i will add if the issue with your fam was due to something about him and you chose him it might be time to mend that relationship best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
im gonna need to know what happened with your parents,Mentalcomposer
where did you live before this apt,Mentalcomposer
i really do not know why you would even entertain the idea of staying with him at this point,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt have a full time job he doesnt help you with anything hes semi neglectful with your 8 mo old probably because hes too preoccupied with gaming and when you finally had the guts to call him out for all that he pushes you,Mentalcomposer
how much are you willing to put up with how far is too far,Mentalcomposer
my advice go back to your parents tell hubby he needs to become a self supporting stable adult if he wants any type of relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
then hold him to it he needs a full time job and he needs to be able to support an apt on his own a couple sessions with a therapist would be a bonus maybe hell realize hes a father and he needs to become a partner in this marriage,Mentalcomposer
you should have just told her you werent going  to see her again after you found out she had a bf you dont have to be mean about it what she does is her business,Mentalcomposer
you might have thought by blocking her it was a slight to her but it didnt slight her in the least shes looking for an explanation give it to her tell her to leave your friends alone and then the block her,Mentalcomposer
this is a really nice picture youre very talented,Mentalcomposer
who isnt remembering your bday,Mentalcomposer
its crappy if your parents or sibs forget but any relatives past that is whatever,Mentalcomposer
if its your friends why would they remember your bday,Mentalcomposer
in either case if your bday is important to you i cant imagine why you had not said anything leading up to the week or day,Mentalcomposer
usually something is mentioned about plans that youd like to do for the day,Mentalcomposer
honestly your friend should just leave jane alone,Mentalcomposer
like who just thinks hm which of my friends can i experiment with,Mentalcomposer
why would friend think jane would be receptive to this idea,Mentalcomposer
add to it that shes probably feeling emotionally vulnerable right now not having her sister as her go to,Mentalcomposer
friend is coming off a bit creepy to me  its giving me the ick,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
please explain because i have no idea,Mentalcomposer
even if its court ordered it doesnt mean that they have to come to an agreement right,Mentalcomposer
samantha could just not agree to any kind of settlement and then it goes to court,Mentalcomposer
or can she agree to a settlement and then release any evidence she would have shown at trial that wouldnt be the worst thing but then we wont get to see the m testify,Mentalcomposer
this story gets even weirder,Mentalcomposer
you hunted for 2 hours you got the kids and then went home by when 7pm,Mentalcomposer
did she cancel just so you could come home and she could fight with you over this,Mentalcomposer
did the friend cancel and she thought shed be home all night alone which really is a good thing considering 2 small kids and being pregnant most of us would have been thrilled,Mentalcomposer
somethings off about her reasoning,Mentalcomposer
let this go this time but know you did nothing wrong you tried to do something nice for your wife,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
im not sure im understanding why your wife is upset,Mentalcomposer
she still went out with her friends no so she got a kid free night out unless her friend also has kids and they were going to entertain each other,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that you both got to do something you wanted and the kids got time with the grand parents win win win for everybody,Mentalcomposer
if she has no underlying issue then honestly i dont wouldnt have a problem with messy rooms they have to live with it,Mentalcomposer
i have the king of messy kids the clothes literally are on the floor right next to the laundry basket,Mentalcomposer
dont pick up her clothes and if she doesnt already she should be doing her own laundry  when she runs out of underwear shell figure it out,Mentalcomposer
if she steps on her art supplies and ruins them they wont be replaced until the next gift giving occasion  bday xmas unless she buys it herself,Mentalcomposer
if she cant find something she needs amongst the rubble shell have to plow thru it all to find it,Mentalcomposer
the place i absolutely draw the line is any food stuff,Mentalcomposer
so i would  literally close her door to the mess as long as the boundary becomes absolutely zero food or drink  other than water is allowed in her room,Mentalcomposer
at some point i get life she will realize that being that messy is a gross way to live,Mentalcomposer
as much as h gives lip service to ending  generational pain he just cannot see the harm he is doing to his own kids,Mentalcomposer
his kids are going to grow up with a very angry dad who blames all his woes on anybody else who has zero self esteem and a mom who can think of no one but herself,Mentalcomposer
meanwhile both parents are at least recreational drug users,Mentalcomposer
those things are going to make for two kids who feel unloved by both parents and anxious kids walking on eggshells around their dad at least,Mentalcomposer
they think theyre so enlightened but they have no clue how to raise happy healthy well adjusted kids,Mentalcomposer
its a shame really those kids could have had the best of everything,Mentalcomposer
those are going to be the longest years of your life,Mentalcomposer
maybe a sit down with d and bf is in order there are certain things he just cannot say and do and demand while in your home,Mentalcomposer
you all have to live together and respecting each other is paramount,Mentalcomposer
why exactly is your ds 25 yo bf living with you,Mentalcomposer
are they going to be able to support themselves after they marry or are you going to have to house them too,Mentalcomposer
he needs to go,Mentalcomposer
i love my 20 something kids but if they want to play house they have to do it in their own house  hes been there a year already whats the plan,Mentalcomposer
im not overly thrilled with this age gap not that youre so old but shes too young for you,Mentalcomposer
its 3 months its not some long term thing happening you should break up with her and tell her to go see her school counselor to get some help with whats going on at home and her self harm,Mentalcomposer
you cannot keep dating her because youre afraid shes going to hurt herself she never said that so dont add to the drama,Mentalcomposer
let him keep walking,Mentalcomposer
these are your kids you make the rules if he doesnt like it too bad,Mentalcomposer
do not let your kids see that you are changing the rules because of what he says or does they need to see you standing up for them,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
her son is having some issues enough that his dad travel 5 hours to be there for and her biggest concern is she needs a massage,Mentalcomposer
she needs her priorities straight,Mentalcomposer
leave at the agreed time and if shes not in the car she takes the train home,Mentalcomposer
do not rush into their room the second they make a sound on that stupid baby monitor   of course go in when they are actually crying,Mentalcomposer
why because they will never learn to self soothe themselves back to sleep if you keep going in and bothering them while theyre sleeping,Mentalcomposer
learned the very hard way,Mentalcomposer
i kind of get the feeling h was too weak meek scared idk to actually think about distancing himself from the rf and when he found a woman who was telling him all the ways it was possible he jumped on it she gave him  in his mind plausible reasons to leave and he didnt have to do it all on his own,Mentalcomposer
if he had thoughts of not having the life he was born into  cause his birth did come with an expectation he couldnt even fathom how he could make that a reality but suddenly someone showed him how,Mentalcomposer
that they made a complete and utter mess of it is another story,Mentalcomposer
you might want to post this in r texas,Mentalcomposer
someone who lives there may be able to answer,Mentalcomposer
this forum is for help using reditt,Mentalcomposer
wait tho i thought megans friends initially leaked not the actual letter but a paraphrasing of it to people magazine and then her dad allowed some other publication to see it and they printed a big part of it no,Mentalcomposer
if thats not what happened then what did,Mentalcomposer
no its been 3 months if youre not into her chances are you wont ever be,Mentalcomposer
would you want to be with someone who describes you like you describe being with her  someone who is repulsed by kissing you,Mentalcomposer
let her go now before she gets even more invested in you,Mentalcomposer
and since youre young ill add do not tell her you  dont and never did feel anything for her  just say its not working for you you think shes a great person but not your person,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you need to do two things,Mentalcomposer
get a court order for child support,Mentalcomposer
petition the court to allow you to move out of state for school,Mentalcomposer
he may not be involved now but if you pick up and move are you sure he wont say you kidnapped the child you dont need more problems,Mentalcomposer
your financial situation all stems from giving up any assets in the divorce,Mentalcomposer
if hes such a good guy maybe you should ask him to give you back your half,Mentalcomposer
see what he says if he wants you out thats how it can be done and then you can get the therapy you need,Mentalcomposer
what happened to your well paying job,Mentalcomposer
as for jenna and the friends theyre out of line did you tell ex what they said and why would he have those people over knowing youre in the house he didnt tell you they were coming and he didnt tell them youd be there whats his game,Mentalcomposer
yta    for not giving your h a heads up,Mentalcomposer
i think son is seeing how dad is with the sister and is feeling like dad isnt  doing as much with him now at this age as he is with sister it may just be that dad thinks son doesnt need as much from him and sis does just by virtue of their ages,Mentalcomposer
but it may be bringing up abandonment issues for son his bio dad didnt want anything to do with him and step dad was ok but not as paternal with him so hes not really a son to a dad,Mentalcomposer
is it true we dont know but son has the perception that it is,Mentalcomposer
you said dad went to games played with son etc so you need to figure out why your son all of a sudden feels dad is not dad enough,Mentalcomposer
i think you did your son and your h a disservice by claiming rights to your son so while h did as much as he did he may have stopped himself doing more  because he was afraid hed cross some line with you not with the son he feels is his own,Mentalcomposer
you need to let h know whats going on so the two of them can talk about it your son might actually realize that the dad he wanted was and is actually the dad he got,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
its not unreasonable to ask for quiet at a certain time of night i dont know why that would bother you so much,Mentalcomposer
stomping up the stairs and slamming the door did not just bother james but probably every other resident of the house,Mentalcomposer
taking out the trash is part of contributing to the upkeep of the home you live in if you lived with anyone else or even alone you would have to do some basic chores in the house,Mentalcomposer
i dont know how much of your stuff you had in the lr but if it was becoming unwieldy then yeah everyone else shouldnt have to live around your stuff,Mentalcomposer
im not commenting on the parking bc i really cant even figure out whats going on there,Mentalcomposer
do you think you should just be able to do whatever you want whenever you want when you share a house with others its called respect for your roommates you need to have some,Mentalcomposer
and she remembered that one convo exactly,Mentalcomposer
its a dead giveaway that it didnt happen like that,Mentalcomposer
at least paraphrase it say it went something like,Mentalcomposer
and i thought there was no conflict until they were at the fitting now were supposed to believe there was already a problem before the fitting and that c started it and that charlotte cried as soon as she put it on shes 3 she might not like the idea of trying any dress on but she wasnt crying over the fit of it,Mentalcomposer
if c had the dress at home and it didnt fit wouldnt she just get it altered,Mentalcomposer
oh and of course this whole thing had,Mentalcomposer
meg sobbing on the floor  again,Mentalcomposer
maybe she washes the floor with all the tears she sheds while shes down there multitasking,Mentalcomposer
better to check it out hoping all turns out well,Mentalcomposer
that struck me as odd,Mentalcomposer
like are they sending contracts back and forth in a negotiation,Mentalcomposer
this statement makes zero sense,Mentalcomposer
so i dont think either of the two directly leaked to the press but i do believe they had other people do it,Mentalcomposer
so id like to see a journalist be a real journalist and piece together how the story got to them and that the only way its possible is thru the sussex camp,Mentalcomposer
they probably wont come out and name names but they can infer who the person was and that would only lead back to them,Mentalcomposer
example if it came from scobie they can say something about the book he wrote or being their main mouthpiece or something,Mentalcomposer
it wont shut h up about leaks but he again will be shown to be the ass that he is for spouting off crap he doesnt have a clue about,Mentalcomposer
youre going to have to describe this painting a bit more,Mentalcomposer
there must be something about it he finds offensive or maybe he just thinks its ugly,Mentalcomposer
but is it just that shes not following the religion,Mentalcomposer
or is it more likely that hes pointing out that she doesnt have to be religious but she shouldnt be mocking his religion in his own home,Mentalcomposer
if she didnt want to pray she should have done the adult thing and respectfully decline not make a mockery of it,Mentalcomposer
the bf didnt even blink and was willing to pray probably,Mentalcomposer
out of respect that these are his gfs parents and we dont know if he is religious or not,Mentalcomposer
d is flouting her independence which 19 yos will do and dad isnt happy about how shes going about it,Mentalcomposer
that needs to be a conversation where dad recognizes her as an adult and d equally acts like an adult,Mentalcomposer
her praying to her god bf should have been pretty cringy to everyone bf included hes old enough to recognize the immaturity of his gf he whispered to her probably to tell her to apologize i wonder if he had anything to say to her when they got home,Mentalcomposer
and thats your fault how exactly,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure he deals with this idk every year does he become unbearable to everyone or just you,Mentalcomposer
anyway nta,Mentalcomposer
so now youre already weak and cant drive im going to assume tomorrow wont be any better because you dont have the meds you need to keep you stronger so is he gonna get them tomorrow or do you just wait for winter when it cools down a bit,Mentalcomposer
hes not really a good partner if these meds are a life long thing how can you trust hell take care of you in the future or if your condition gets worse,Mentalcomposer
i was thinking you were talking about booking thru dvc because you referenced the 11 month mark which is when as a dvc you can start booking,Mentalcomposer
if you werent then disregard most everything i wrote because it will not apply,Mentalcomposer
i havent made a cash stay at disney but if the booking window only opens at the 11 mo mark then the advice to be ready at exactly that day and even as close to the hour as possible would still apply,Mentalcomposer
sorry if i confused you,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused,Mentalcomposer
they want to figure out why so many others of their own party  but really its jan 6 ppl and trump are being investigated as opposed to what,Mentalcomposer
just sweeping it under the rug and not investigating or are they saying these are not legitimate investigations and are more being done based on party politics,Mentalcomposer
if you break the law you get investigated and probably usually maybe charged,Mentalcomposer
im getting a little sick of congress investigating anything they investigate while ongoing investigations are being done by other law enforcement agencies its just redundantif i was an innocent witness id be overwhelmed being grilled by le and congress,Mentalcomposer
as long as you have enough home points at either or both resorts you should absolutely be ready to book at the exact hour at the 11 mo mark,Mentalcomposer
check to make sure but im pretty sure you cant combine your poly and wl points to use at either resort at 11 mo youd have to use for instance your poly points at poly at 11 mo and then add to the res using your wl points at the 7 mo mark because one of them isnt your home resort at the other resort i hope that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
keep in mind if youre looking around at 2023 summer availability to get an idea of how it is its already past the 11 mo and close to the 7 mo mark so you wont get an adequate comparison,Mentalcomposer
if youre looking at 11 mo out availability just to see what it looks like in 2023 its not a good comparison because its a diff month and season if im doing it right that puts you in late nov early dec which is prime time,Mentalcomposer
what change exactly are they fighting for,Mentalcomposer
do they think just because they are an interracial couple they can eradicate racism by what just being a couple,Mentalcomposer
if it was that easy it would have been gone decades ago,Mentalcomposer
exactly what injustice has been done to them megan got some bad press well welcome to the world of a public figure it happens to any and everyone who has a public profile,Mentalcomposer
these two think that just because they want  to be seen as doing no wrong no one is allowed to call them out when they do wrong,Mentalcomposer
anybody else just getting bored of the whole thing i come here to keep up but its just a never ending circle jerk,Mentalcomposer
and if no one reported on them theyd just do something even more outrageous to be back in the news and start the whole cycle over again,Mentalcomposer
yes i realize how that sounds as im commenting on them but its just all so absurd,Mentalcomposer
these two are so dramatic,Mentalcomposer
any visit they would have in the uk for any royal engagement theyd take a private plane  cause they could never fly commercial and be driven to whatever royal house theyd be staying at their security guard they already employ could travel with them,Mentalcomposer
once there they have regular security  for the house compound grounds etc thats already in place anyway,Mentalcomposer
then when they have to get to the engagement theyd be traveling with all of the rest of the family that would have security,Mentalcomposer
there is literally no way anyone could get to them not that anyones coming,Mentalcomposer
they really think theyre all that huh,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
its time you sit your mom down and lay out some facts that she either gets on board with or she doesnt come,Mentalcomposer
these people have done nothing wrong and have actually been good to you i think its great that you can have at least some of her dads fam in her life,Mentalcomposer
tell your mom that going forward its joint everything and that includes your fil  she doesnt have to like everyone that you choose to be friends with but she sure has to respect your relationships with them,Mentalcomposer
her crying over this stuff is so over the top its childish the longer you allow it to go on the worse it will get,Mentalcomposer
7 months on and off  this is not a relationship thats going well no,Mentalcomposer
cut your losses now shes gonna find something else to fly off the handle for and youll be equally as baffled as this time,Mentalcomposer
and her following you is odd she was probably worried you were snooping in her room because you were taking longer than usual because of the spill which then also explains why she sent you out and she stayed behind to make sure everything was in its place,Mentalcomposer
do you want someone who doesnt trust you,Mentalcomposer
why are we even discussing kc paying her off,Mentalcomposer
he owes her nothing not even ransom to get his son back,Mentalcomposer
if h suddenly decides he needs out then he can go thru the divorce court on his own and they can fight it out,Mentalcomposer
so basically h just refuses to listen to any criticism of anything his bro and dad say about m megxit and bullying,Mentalcomposer
but when the bro and dad refuse to listen to his counter argument theyre in the wrong,Mentalcomposer
he just refuses to believe that she can be anything but an angel and thats why hes in the position hes in,Mentalcomposer
the 25 page bullying rebuttal is probably filled with excuses shes american she didnt know thats not how she does things shes direct not rude etc,Mentalcomposer
but it doesnt matter she joined a family that has rules regulations and a way things are done you cant come in and expect them to change for you and thats what they wanted they wanted to modernizean institution that doesnt need modernizing because to the witch that means making the brf a money making merchandiser,Mentalcomposer
and once again this is why the fam doesnt want to talk to him because there is nothing private,Mentalcomposer
im gonna be brutally honest with you,Mentalcomposer
you willingly got into a relationship with a man who cheats and leaves every relationship hes ever had and to placate him you decide to have an open relationship which really in this situation is just you agreeing to let him cheat,Mentalcomposer
how exactly did you think this was not going to end any other way than with him leaving you,Mentalcomposer
did you think as long as he was having sex with other women he would always come back to you,Mentalcomposer
why would you want a life of sharing the person you love with multiple others,Mentalcomposer
and the worst part  you brought your then 9 year old  at the time who grew up in this situation along for the ride,Mentalcomposer
think about what youve been modeling to your d,Mentalcomposer
do you want her to hitch herself to men who cheat and leave,Mentalcomposer
or do you want to model a monogamous loving relationship which is what you should be striving for,Mentalcomposer
you know what you have to do find some self respect and leave his sorry ass stand up for yourself and show your d now while shes just starting to figure out relationships what she should and shouldnt be accepting from a partner,Mentalcomposer
whats wrong with his health,Mentalcomposer
i havent heard of anything,Mentalcomposer
everyone already thinks andrew is  scum so writing unflattering stories of andrew insulting or upsetting either one of them isnt going to elicit any sympathy for hm,Mentalcomposer
or andrew knows way too much about her past antics,Mentalcomposer
or hes not high enough on the pecking order knocking him down a peg or two isnt gonna elevate h to king,Mentalcomposer
or he needs to stay in beatrices good graces to get the inside scoop,Mentalcomposer
or most probable andrew just doesnt care enough to have any dealings with the lunatic fringe of the family he saw the train wreck coming and noped out,Mentalcomposer
seriously tho where did he get the hair,Mentalcomposer
did he cut it off her head in the coffin,Mentalcomposer
did she give it to him after a haircut,Mentalcomposer
and why would he even want it,Mentalcomposer
did he need it to make a witches potion,Mentalcomposer
im so baffled by this hair in a box,Mentalcomposer
yta a massive massive one,Mentalcomposer
there is no excuse for a 7 yo to smear lipstick all over anything,Mentalcomposer
your d showed great restraint in only yelling at the little brat,Mentalcomposer
the one who should be punished is layla she has been told repeatedly to leave your ds stuff alone and she keeps repeating the offense with no consequence,Mentalcomposer
you cannot expect your d to lock up everything she owns every single day and night in her own room that you moved her ss into because you wanted to marry her mother stop bending over backward to placate your wife and her kids thats ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with you how did you ever parent your own kids since it seems youre clueless,Mentalcomposer
give your d back her phone buy her a new dress and punish the 7 year old,Mentalcomposer
stop making your 16 yo teach the 7 yo what her mother should be teaching her,Mentalcomposer
oh and of course your wife thinks the punishment is fine her little angel of a,Mentalcomposer
d should never be made to cry,Mentalcomposer
be a better parent to your d,Mentalcomposer
come on man you went to the best schools from the age of 3 are we to believe that you never ever had a lesson on hitler and the nazis,Mentalcomposer
does he really expect us to believe that he had absolutely zero idea that costume was not just offensive but its one of those absolutely do not do things,Mentalcomposer
the fam def paid way too much for his education,Mentalcomposer
at this point the longest or shortest  idc serving independent,Mentalcomposer
enough with d and r,Mentalcomposer
it stops the circus thats happening now,Mentalcomposer
i think willy and harold are honestly just snarky nicknames that had for each other as kids,Mentalcomposer
i could see harry calling him willy as in dick and w calling him harold because its like an old man name,Mentalcomposer
theyre were just making fun of each other as kids,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i agree it wasnt your secret to tell,Mentalcomposer
your wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it she will change her ways this is a good thing,Mentalcomposer
she should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldnt tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her,Mentalcomposer
this could turn out to be a good thing,Mentalcomposer
nono you got it all wrong,Mentalcomposer
megsie was the one wronged by all members of the family the media her ex husband her ex bfs her dad her siblings in all things ever,Mentalcomposer
they all caused the strife that was blamed on her,Mentalcomposer
and shell keep saying it until we all agree with her,Mentalcomposer
good point youre right they probably laid it all out for him,Mentalcomposer
and leaving out the details is what makes him look like a whining child,Mentalcomposer
im sure c had a legit reason for not wanting m there and even if its that he wanted just immediate family,Mentalcomposer
h cant say what that reason he was given because it would make him look bad to argue about it so he leaves it out thinking it will make c look like the bad guy but of course that would never happen because c can dictate whatever the hell he wants in regards to his mothers death,Mentalcomposer
whats meant by this,Mentalcomposer
its not hard to see why prince harry and meghan markle decided to leave england amid all this drama and tension and we havent even gotten into harry and williams physical fightwhich you can read about in detail below,Mentalcomposer
the drama and tension was started by harry and megan with their over entitlement with their feelings of superiority their jealousy of every other working royal,Mentalcomposer
dont want drama and tension dont start it,Mentalcomposer
you need to keep working on your jealousy issues or they will come into play and ruin every other relationship you will have in the future,Mentalcomposer
take your jealousy issue as the lesson you learned from this relationship and use that thought as motivation to move on and be thankful that this happened at a young age instead of having a string of failed relationships,Mentalcomposer
in the future i would advise that you not spend all your time with a partner its not healthy for anyone,Mentalcomposer
its not sustainable in the long run,Mentalcomposer
its not that you cant move in because youre so stuck on this o e girl its that you have no idea what to do with the time you normally spent with her,Mentalcomposer
find a hobby read a book do a puzzle anything so you dont just sit like a lump on a log and pine away for someone that doesnt want to be with you,Mentalcomposer
after the book if theres more vague crap the palace can legitimately make a statement saying something to the affect that,Mentalcomposer
even though the k will always have a fathers love for a son its become quite obvious that h  m are doing their level best to distance themselves from the family for the celebration of the coronation the k has decided that he will adhere to their want of distance,Mentalcomposer
idk something diplomatic without coming out and saying no one wants them here,Mentalcomposer
no one is ever going to think it has anything to do with race that horse is dead beaten dug up beat some more and reburied,Mentalcomposer
most telling to me is this passage,Mentalcomposer
harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare,Mentalcomposer
this is the crux of h he admits it,Mentalcomposer
all of his moaning and it all comes down to the fact that he isnt going to be king,Mentalcomposer
too bad so sad 30 years and he still hasnt come to terms with it,Mentalcomposer
i think being a global icon is her goal,Mentalcomposer
she thought she hit the jackpot when she bagged the dimwit she really thought that overnight her name would be recognizable to everyone and every possible door to fame and fortune would be opened for her,Mentalcomposer
so basically she thought shed be an icon for basically getting married,Mentalcomposer
in reality shes half of a couple with a victim complex who people are sick of hearing from and about,Mentalcomposer
i think an invictus show would have been interesting to watch,Mentalcomposer
if and only if,Mentalcomposer
h was actually working with an organization to benefit and help veterans if he did that and it got even minimal press i think ppl would tune in,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that he hosts the games and then disappears theres zero follow up on the athletes the help they get nothing,Mentalcomposer
idk anything about invictus are they an organization that puts these games on do companies sponsor the games is it a money making endeavor what do the athletes get out of competing in these games,Mentalcomposer
i thought i saw somewhere that somehow the rf was instrumental in starting it,Mentalcomposer
these are the answers i would have liked to see answered from a docu of the games,Mentalcomposer
if its just disabled vets competing in sports then what sets them apart from the para olympics  i guess theres something to be said for it being all vets,Mentalcomposer
so many arguments can be avoided if we just talk to each other,Mentalcomposer
everyone in my house knows when im going into the kitchen to cook did you not know she was  in the kitchen making supper,Mentalcomposer
did you not go in and ask what shes cooking  was supper supposed to be a surprise  notice you didnt mention or even suggest having something hot since they were out in the cold all day,Mentalcomposer
was she tired from being out doing an activity all day and just wanted to make something quick and easy quite possible or she planned that meal before they went skating and already had the ingredients,Mentalcomposer
this is so petty by both of you,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have made a face and she shouldnt be mad that you wanted to eat something else that you went and made,Mentalcomposer
that is exactly what i said,Mentalcomposer
those kinds of opp sex relationships are the only ones that are acceptable,Mentalcomposer
to cut contact with,Mentalcomposer
im not sure how unpopular this really is,Mentalcomposer
if you cut contact with one or two of the opposite sex for an actual reason like theyre youre sexting partners who you dont have an irl friendship with then maybe its not a bad idea if its your decision,Mentalcomposer
but cutting all contact just because is ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
even more cringy is your new partner demanding that you cut contact with anyone of the opposite sex cant even like someones picture or make a comment  those people need a huge dose of reality but i think these cases are more a result of immaturity,Mentalcomposer
nope one hit and im out,Mentalcomposer
i dont care what you said to him,Mentalcomposer
it really is that simple,Mentalcomposer
i could see him saying he had no idea what was going to happen at the coronation and that he had no choice but to say those words since he was put on the spot,Mentalcomposer
hell use the excuse that since nobody is talking to him they didnt explain what was going to happen at the coronation he just showed up thinking it would be like a church service or something,Mentalcomposer
could you just imagine the stupidly is endless,Mentalcomposer
i agree with checking but then why would the h not be experiencing any issues its only her,Mentalcomposer
if he goes out of the house to work and she stays home could it affect her that much more i dont really know,Mentalcomposer
honestly its not that hard to poke your head into whatever room theyre in to say hello when you get to your bf house you dont have to roam the house to find both of them but if theyre in the living room or kitchen its not that hard to do,Mentalcomposer
my kids so do that every time and then they go to their room,Mentalcomposer
the dog incident you should have had a lighthearted comment about it  would have been nice to know before she eats my hand or something,Mentalcomposer
did you say hi to his mom at work or were you waiting for her to engage you if youre still at work go over and say something anything start the conversation maybe say you bf told you why shes annoyed and apologize tell her youll do better from now on,Mentalcomposer
this should blow over but going forward make sure you say hello its just common courtesy,Mentalcomposer
and please dont stay over so much even if you dont think it it does disrupt the flow of the house,Mentalcomposer
i see where youre coming from i really do and could understand where many people would have the same outlook as you,Mentalcomposer
but the royal family is not a govt its not a political body they have no legislative power,Mentalcomposer
they are however a focus of national identity and pride with a huge focus on service it is a thousands year old tradition that i would say has changed with the times as they are no longer the rulers of nations,Mentalcomposer
now if harry wants changes to the brf or the monarchy i have not seen one example of what he wants to change,Mentalcomposer
have you because if he did i missed it,Mentalcomposer
being a rebellious teen is nothing new but its a far cry from airing every perceived slight you have ever had in your life,Mentalcomposer
and again what terrible attacks has megan be subjected to,Mentalcomposer
the paper that printed the compton thing was chastised for it,Mentalcomposer
the tiara issue is in line with protecting the actual royal jewels,Mentalcomposer
the issue of who made who cry happened it wasnt some made up story someone let it slip but m and kate werent the only ones there something happened and neither you or me know the real story,Mentalcomposer
the fact that m cut off her whole family is true its human nature to want to know why and the media is right in trying to delve into why she was a very popular person at the time and most people thought it was a horrible thing for her as in what could they have possibly done to her for her to take so drastic a measure,Mentalcomposer
on the flip side there is no video evidence that they are or were being relentlessly pursued by paparazzi which they claim,Mentalcomposer
there is no verifiable info that anyone said or made any racist overtures to her which they claim,Mentalcomposer
according to them the proposal could be two diff times,Mentalcomposer
they were married 3 days earlier  proven lie  they didnt help with the finding freedom book thats a proven lie  there were leaks i agree im just not convinced every single one of them were coming from the palace so what benefit could mh have for leaking some themselves hmm,Mentalcomposer
theres just a lot i mean a lot of discrepancies when they come out with their stories some probably have a grain of truth but the embellishment goes way beyond,Mentalcomposer
well agree to disagree and do it in a polite civilized way and thats a good thing,Mentalcomposer
ok im gonna say this not to be mean but just as a thought since you havent given us much insight to your actual level of commitment,Mentalcomposer
you were dating 3 months which isnt very long,Mentalcomposer
hes been gone for most of your relationship,Mentalcomposer
you two have barely spent any of these 11 months together  if you even saw him at all since his deployment,Mentalcomposer
im thinking he may not be thinking this is as serious as you,Mentalcomposer
time alone is not a good judge of the seriousness of a relationship especially when you are apart,Mentalcomposer
do i think he likes you sure he does but not enough to rework his whole life around you,Mentalcomposer
but is he sitting in his bunk pining away for you maybe not,Mentalcomposer
sorry again not trying to be mean,Mentalcomposer
were you dating before he went in,Mentalcomposer
how long were you dating before he got deployed,Mentalcomposer
thank you for the award,Mentalcomposer
heres my take on all this,Mentalcomposer
id point out that these arent 2 young people,Mentalcomposer
even when they met he was 32 and she was 34 hardly the age of naive change the world attitude,Mentalcomposer
both of them have years of life experience and know the ways of the world,Mentalcomposer
and hes been in this family has known exactly how it was run and worked and i dont ever recall him speaking out previous to megan about any toxicity,Mentalcomposer
note he could have i wasnt and still not obsessed with everything royal,Mentalcomposer
they lieproven they implynever a definitive explanation of this person said i said they never show any proof of the so called leaks or planted stories racist behavior or snub by anyone,Mentalcomposer
makes it kind of hard to believe what they say and a lot of it is just so freakin silly and stupid stuff that if it happened in your real life youd be thinking why are we even having this conversation,Mentalcomposer
its tiresome at this point 3 years since they left theyre not going to change the way the monarchy works its not their job it was never their job,Mentalcomposer
i dont know why they ever thought it was,Mentalcomposer
add to this their idea that they were going to be advocates of climate issues humanitarian issues womans issues whatever else and they have done exactly zero on any of these fronts,Mentalcomposer
they have literally not done anything but whine and complain and collect awards they did not earn,Mentalcomposer
thats why people dont like them not because of some fan girling of the royal family,Mentalcomposer
so he drops the idea that the family or the palace planted stories when there was some kind of conflict,Mentalcomposer
ok then,Mentalcomposer
you would think any journalist with any journalistic integritys next question would be,Mentalcomposer
what was the conflict about and what story was planted can you give me an example,Mentalcomposer
but of course it never gets asked and were back to again accusations with absolutely zero evidence to back it up,Mentalcomposer
and this is exactly why i do not believe a word they say,Mentalcomposer
i believe there were conflicts either between members of the fam or even the palace bc thats just the nature of relationships at some point but i truly think the two of them wanted something wanted to do something or go somewhere and they were rebuffed for whatever reason,Mentalcomposer
so true to form for egotistical people they went immediately to a conspiracy against them instead of like a normal person trying to find a way to compromise and make it work,Mentalcomposer
and there were no leaked stories these two did something while out and about and the press wrote about,Mentalcomposer
it whatever it was showed them in not the best light but instead of realizing they shouldnt have done that or said that they jump right to it must be a leak or a plant,Mentalcomposer
these two are so delusional it defies any sense of rationale,Mentalcomposer
a couple things stood out as i read,Mentalcomposer
since the ultimate goal is for him to get his own apt hes essentially moving into your apt temporarily  in that case i think he could make it a point to just not put meat or fish in the refig,Mentalcomposer
will it be a pain sometimes yes it will but its your apt he can eat meat when you two go out or pick up something from fast food on occasion or if he really gets an urge for a steak on a random day he can pick 1 steak note 1 on the way home from work and cook it or he can get 1 burger from the butcher in the grocery store basically just enough for him to eat that one meal at home,Mentalcomposer
yes its not as convenient as having these all in the freezer but it is what it is,Mentalcomposer
it will work as long as he fully agrees to all of this with out moaning about it and you need to have this convo now not in the spring he needs to know this is a non negotiable and agree to it,Mentalcomposer
and then once he gets his own apt you have to be ok with him having meat in his refrigerator or freezer,Mentalcomposer
id also have him buy his own pans to cook any meat in just for your comfort if you need that,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind it might take him a while to actually find a job in his field does he have a plan b in case that doesnt happen,Mentalcomposer
oh i dont either but i was thinking thats the incident  op was referencing,Mentalcomposer
so if he insinuated william cheated,Mentalcomposer
do we think william will need to make some sort of statement or,Mentalcomposer
do we think itll be written off as just another lie,Mentalcomposer
if he insinuated william didnt marry for love and there was another he wanted instead was there even ever another steady long term girlfriend that he dated who would believe that,Mentalcomposer
no way i believe william made any racist remark about what the baby would look like i dont know many men who would even think about it seems more like something women would chat about in a nice way,Mentalcomposer
ah thank you  some kind of id makes so much sense,Mentalcomposer
id guess that when the ada for service animals came out there probably werent as many people faking and im sure way less people needing esas so it probably wasnt seen as needed because at the time who would ever question such a thing,Mentalcomposer
i thought you werent allowed to ask what service is being done but i didnt even know there were any papers that can be shown so i learned something thanks for that info,Mentalcomposer
isnt it true that there are no papers that show an animal is a service animal so anyone with a pet can claim whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
so the problem is theres no legal way to ensure that a service animal is actually one and thats why emotional support animals are being seen everywhere,Mentalcomposer
in my opinion a true service dog needs to have some kind of official papers that should need to be shown upon request to allow the animal into places that pets normally arent,Mentalcomposer
i dont think that anyone who actually needs a service animal would be put off having to show that it is an actual service animal,Mentalcomposer
anyone who could find fault with something i do every single day is not someone id want to be with,Mentalcomposer
does he never mess up i bet he does but you dont point it out and rag on him for it,Mentalcomposer
you both have some issues youre not dealing with and if you want this or any other relationship to work youre both going to have to get help to get to a point that youre both mentally stable   you dont mention having any therapy but you both should be seeing someone,Mentalcomposer
idk what you mean about getting a huge boost about rejecting men,Mentalcomposer
but doesnt it make sense that one can be wanting to find a partner but isnt willing to be with just anyone who happens to be male  or female it goes both ways,Mentalcomposer
everyone is only going to date people they are attracted to if they dont meet anyone who they like then why date them,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your wife saying that you shouldnt teach your kids to act a certain way so people will like them is correct,Mentalcomposer
but thats not what youre doing in this instance you arent fundamentally changing who your d is youre pointing out that lateness when boiled down is really about not valuing the person you are meeting and that friends will want to be valued and not made to seem like their time isnt important,Mentalcomposer
you wouldnt ask your d to change her clothes hair hobbies or opinions to fit in those are the things that make your d who she is youre just making her see that other peoples time is as important as hers,Mentalcomposer
try explaining it that way to your wife,Mentalcomposer
listen to your mom,Mentalcomposer
we always discount her opinion but ultimately they are right,Mentalcomposer
she knows what she sees shes been thru it with your sisters,Mentalcomposer
this relationship is just not working,Mentalcomposer
its time to let it go for both of your sakes,Mentalcomposer
it will be tough for a few months but youll get over him and be fine,Mentalcomposer
yeah shes being stupid,Mentalcomposer
maybe she enjoys the danger of it maybe she thinks is exciting,Mentalcomposer
whatever it is you warned her,Mentalcomposer
shell be crying soon because he dumps her and she caught feelings,Mentalcomposer
or shell be crying when she realizes hes just using her for sex,Mentalcomposer
either way its gonna be ugly,Mentalcomposer
how does she know its really open,Mentalcomposer
if she wants to continue with this guy she should ask to speak to his wife to make sure it is really an open marriage,Mentalcomposer
in any event why does she want to expend any energy on a man who is taken,Mentalcomposer
why would you not immediately turn around and go home when he told you he was homeless was he homeless with his 2 kids that live with him,Mentalcomposer
like where did he think you were going to sleep he had no car and 6 kids,Mentalcomposer
raise this baby alone he is useless,Mentalcomposer
he cant even support himself how do you think hes going to support you  you do not need the kind of support he is offering,Mentalcomposer
you seemed to be doing ok before you blew all your money on him,Mentalcomposer
plus his kids are a mess,Mentalcomposer
you will literally be moving into a nightmare,Mentalcomposer
please dont do that to yourself and your child,Mentalcomposer
i have to know the trip to england that you described was that the only time you met him and was that when you got pregnant,Mentalcomposer
omg that sounds like pure hell,Mentalcomposer
you have my sympathy,Mentalcomposer
youve got a few months till easter really work on hubby to get him on board with a schedule that doesnt,Mentalcomposer
have you running all the time,Mentalcomposer
when you want to talk about your struggles without her trying to fix it you need to tell her youre not looking for advice but to just open up to her because you trust her with these things and so she can understand where youre coming from,Mentalcomposer
as far as her opening up maybe she doesnt really have anything to open up about not everyone has or had struggles that they need or want to talk about or maybe she just doesnt want to burden you with her stuff being aware that you have enough going on and doesnt want you dwelling on her crap too,Mentalcomposer
you can always go direct with her and tell her you want to develop a more intimate emotional connection and see what she says,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year,Mentalcomposer
decide on easter thanksgiving and both xmas days thats four so its easy to split them between the 2 families,Mentalcomposer
dont let him railroad you hold your ground if his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house,Mentalcomposer
once you two have come to a decision then you have him tell his mom what the plan going forward is,Mentalcomposer
as an aside i dont know if xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for and to add yet another wrench into the mix you might want to do xmas day at home so your kids dont have to leave their toys every xmas thats the one thing my h always said sucked,Mentalcomposer
as for this nye there would be no way in hell i would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party thats insane send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son they will survive not seeing you for a few hours,Mentalcomposer
just have kate send you your own invitation then youll be invited on your own not included on your dad and sms invite,Mentalcomposer
then find another single fam member and share a room with them to cut your costs,Mentalcomposer
you dont think they want you to stay home to watch the 3 yo do you,Mentalcomposer
thats a big fat no,Mentalcomposer
eatontown has the most retched people on the planet,Mentalcomposer
i put all the docs i needed on the counter spread out so she could see every one of them,Mentalcomposer
that stupid miserable human wouldnt pick my document off the counter i had to pick them up and hand them to her one at a time,Mentalcomposer
havent been back since ill go to hazlet much more civilized there,Mentalcomposer
but the inspection people are very nice especially the woman who works there,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your bf and cousin sure are,Mentalcomposer
what was he thinking he doesnt even know these people and he says crap like that,Mentalcomposer
your bf is disgusting why would you still want to date him,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
if you cant handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college,Mentalcomposer
its past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own,Mentalcomposer
try an audiobook,Mentalcomposer
i also like to scan the radio to see what kind of music is played in diff parts of the country,Mentalcomposer
how old,Mentalcomposer
and have you never spent any time with these kids before,Mentalcomposer
are they always a bit rambunctious or is it maybe being off of school and holidays and their schedules being out of wack have them a bit crazier than normal,Mentalcomposer
you need to decide if you want to be with your bf bad enough to actually try to have a relationship with his kids actually if youre married youre already a step parent doesnt mean its all on you but you cant just ditch out whenever he has them thats a shitty thing to do they wont always be small and by the time they are old enough they wont want anything to do with you,Mentalcomposer
so i kind of agree with you but just because i dont like oranges,Mentalcomposer
and im not a fan of mixed fruit salad theres always one fruit that gets mushy and then its mixed in with the other still good fruit,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
ok yeah his reactions are sketchy,Mentalcomposer
can you ask for a family meeting just to clear the air a bit obviously you dont want to live with any tension in the house you want your mom to be happy but this whole situation is out of left field,Mentalcomposer
other than that im out of ideas,Mentalcomposer
since youre getting nowhere with your mom have you tried talking to him,Mentalcomposer
just at least to get a sense of him,Mentalcomposer
if hes a decent person hell understand if you preface with something like this is all new and odd to me having my mom move a guy in so can we just have a chat about whats going on here considering i didnt even know you two were having this ldr,Mentalcomposer
like what kind of job did he have maybe hes early retired and actually has some money or it could be he never had much of a career which is a red flag,Mentalcomposer
how olds the d does she live with the mom is he planning on keeping up visits is he responsible at least to his d,Mentalcomposer
does he have family siblings and does he get along with them,Mentalcomposer
then after a bit you can ask if he has any plan to get his own apt and job you know sort of just live in the same city and date you never really know a person just from online talking he might realize he doesnt actually like your mom,Mentalcomposer
cant hurt to try he might not even want to talk to you which would be weird or he may be fine with your obvious inquiry as to whats going on,Mentalcomposer
its def a strange turn of events in your moms part,Mentalcomposer
okra,Mentalcomposer
i tried to expand my veggie eating but okra was just gross,Mentalcomposer
thank you,Mentalcomposer
is he planning on getting a job at some point his own apt,Mentalcomposer
for arguments sake lets say your mom and him really like each other fine his lease is up so they decide to have him move closer so they can date,Mentalcomposer
this is all ok as long as he stays with her but only until he can get a job apt and support himself,Mentalcomposer
if this is whats going on id say its crappy that she just sprung him on you did you even know she was talking to this guy,Mentalcomposer
like did she mention it at all,Mentalcomposer
what a wonderful find,Mentalcomposer
for my bridal shower my mom gave me a set of embroidered pillow cases that my grandma made for me,Mentalcomposer
i had no idea they existed it was a really nice sentimental surprise she had been gone for a while by then,Mentalcomposer
oh and its been 33 years and i never used them idk why not i think i just wanted them to stay nice,Mentalcomposer
are you saying you are seeing something diff,Mentalcomposer
if so id like to hear yours please,Mentalcomposer
i dont know anything about how tarot works but it would be interesting to see what differs,Mentalcomposer
while i agree she had to learn it somewhere but im not convinced its from her dad,Mentalcomposer
she seemed to have a regular upbringing by her dad albeit one where she was spoiled which would give her an inflated opinion of herself,Mentalcomposer
but once she decided to act is where i think she got the transactional idea,Mentalcomposer
i would think it happens a lot in hollywood you do this for me i do this for you,Mentalcomposer
it started with trevor,Mentalcomposer
i absolutely think she married trevor for that transactional relationship what he can do for her career and all she had to do in return was be with him when she had no use for him anymore he was discarded,Mentalcomposer
then it carried into everyone else she seemed to be friendswith,Mentalcomposer
sophie markus corey,Mentalcomposer
in every one of these relationships she was trying to do something that these people all were somewhat related to,Mentalcomposer
sophie and markus for highbrow connections,Mentalcomposer
corey when she wanted to be a food blogger or whatever the heck she was trying to do,Mentalcomposer
so with h it was a case of this person has intl recognition is widely thought of as a decent person concerned with the environment and veterans and i want that too,Mentalcomposer
just a thought,Mentalcomposer
i think its a matter of access,Mentalcomposer
if you always brought a person  into the fold  they can be family based,Mentalcomposer
on the person  bringing them in,Mentalcomposer
my adult kids  have brought people around sporadically  but if i know my kid is invested  in this relationship i treat them as one of the fam,Mentalcomposer
thats what you do you bring them in based on your child,Mentalcomposer
but i welcome everyone,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its not like he helps with anything else involving your apt so why would he think hed have to help with your nephews,Mentalcomposer
seriously hes nothing but a mooch,Mentalcomposer
all he pays for his his car and insurance  so basically just his stuff,Mentalcomposer
why are you allowing him to freeload off of you,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i dont even know why there was any awkwardness,Mentalcomposer
wife had friends over husband leaves to give the girls time to hang out,Mentalcomposer
now if you told your wife in front of jamie that you didnt want her there then it would be awkward but im assuming that didnt happen because based on the rest of the post jamie would have started something,Mentalcomposer
your wife really needs to start standing up to jamie tho the part about you and w not taking someone elses grief seriously is just so out of line and your wifes voice raising thing is something you would think jamie would know by now,Mentalcomposer
how old is the brother,Mentalcomposer
does your bf hang out with him on his own,Mentalcomposer
if hes a bunch younger than you guys he might not want to hang out with  old ppl  not that youre old but to him maybe,Mentalcomposer
if hes closer in age then its up to your bf to plan a get together so you two can get to know each other better,Mentalcomposer
either way i say just go be nice,Mentalcomposer
dont try to force a connection if its not there,Mentalcomposer
i just dont understand why this wasnt a conversation,Mentalcomposer
does he frequently make plans that youre not invited to,Mentalcomposer
why cant you and d go  brother is married so its not a boys thing,Mentalcomposer
especially that hes gone for nye since we were dating weve always spent nye together,Mentalcomposer
i dont like your h at all,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you are already committed to be groomsman in the friends wedding,Mentalcomposer
thats a perfectly viable reason to miss the cousins wedding,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but the second you walked in and saw the other dogs your h should have been the one to ask him mom what the deal was,Mentalcomposer
not you him,Mentalcomposer
its now days later you and h are upset at her shes probably pissed because she didnt see her son again and is of course blaming you and the fact that she lied to you about no dogs coming this year has still not been addressed,Mentalcomposer
its not gonna get better no matter what you do but h should be pointing out any snubs or nastiness from his mom every single time,Mentalcomposer
i agree on the counseling,Mentalcomposer
at this point your normal is explosive arguing and neither of you have any idea how to get out of this cycle,Mentalcomposer
but also as an idea think back to your last argument that spiraled out of control and dissect it from beginning to end try to recall exactly what was said and by who,Mentalcomposer
do this just for yourself not to find who was to blame but to try to see where the disagreement went off the rails,Mentalcomposer
its always a good idea to have some kind of understanding of how things turn bad,Mentalcomposer
again not to place blame but to analyze  what the dynamic is like between the two of you and if you could have a do over what would you have said instead that may have changed the course of the argument,Mentalcomposer
a sort of self reflection,Mentalcomposer
he knows but she doesnt,Mentalcomposer
its not like hes leaking this crap,Mentalcomposer
he has no idea half the time what shes orchestrating,Mentalcomposer
that doesnt absolve him of going along with all of it after the fact tho,Mentalcomposer
and ill bet once he figures out that its her she admits it but whats he gonna do he cant contradict her once its out there so he has to play the game her game,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
there is no way back for them,Mentalcomposer
he might be brought back but not to the life he had,Mentalcomposer
hell be treated like andrew living a life far away from any royal duties he may be invited to select things like xmas church service but thats it,Mentalcomposer
well see him sporadically riding a horse or something,Mentalcomposer
im not even sure if the fam will let the kids back if she gets unsupervised visits h cant be anywhere near her alone once  if hes free of her grasp,Mentalcomposer
too much risk that hell say something that shell exploit,Mentalcomposer
just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing unless she is competing in either sport,Mentalcomposer
neither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue,Mentalcomposer
she already knows how to ride and climb after that its just for practice,Mentalcomposer
plus i think learning sign language is awesome,Mentalcomposer
you have got to be kidding with this,Mentalcomposer
your bf wants nothing more to do with you youre a cheater,Mentalcomposer
leave him alone you cant get him back you dont deserve him,Mentalcomposer
i couldnt read the article so sorry if this was in it,Mentalcomposer
it might be effective depending on what happens when you test positive if youre quarantined until you test negative then maybe it will be effective,Mentalcomposer
i think the bigger issue is since china isnt very forthcoming with any data they may have variants caused by mutations that the rest of the world hasnt even seen yet,Mentalcomposer
my biggest worry is a variant that is more dangerous that starts to spread well be back to the exact place we were at the beginning,Mentalcomposer
this is less about you and your sister and more about what your parents should be saying to your sister,Mentalcomposer
they need to get her petty jealousy under control,Mentalcomposer
she made her choice of schools and you made yours it isnt as if your parents denied her the choice they need to explain that to her and tell her to knock off the rivalry,Mentalcomposer
your mom cant stay neutral when this is affecting the whole household and you dad needs to do more than just be pissed at sister,Mentalcomposer
maybe because he said they bonded over their shared military service,Mentalcomposer
we dont really know that op even knew his grandpa had any money or if he did he assumed it would go to gramps child  ops parent,Mentalcomposer
op was at his lowest and sought out the person who could relate to what he was going thru after his deployment his visits could have started for that exact purpose but turned into wanting to make sure his grandpa wasnt alone in his last years,Mentalcomposer
its possible he actually enjoyed visiting,Mentalcomposer
i dont think we can understand what op went thru on deployment and how having that outlet was probably vital to his well being,Mentalcomposer
for all we know grandpa might have wanted op to have the money knowing he wouldnt be around forever and wanted to ensure op had the financial resources to get the help he needed in the future,Mentalcomposer
its happening whether you fear it or not so just dont dwell on it,Mentalcomposer
concentrate on the excitement of the baby,Mentalcomposer
and like the other poster said you dont care about anything but getting that baby out of you youre just done being pregnant,Mentalcomposer
obviously this relationship is not working  why would you want to put more effort in,Mentalcomposer
break up but take some time to get yourself straightened out nobody wants a sad depressed partner who wont talk to them,Mentalcomposer
once youre happy with and by yourself you can be a good partner to someone,Mentalcomposer
if he says hes not very experienced i think in this instance you should believe him,Mentalcomposer
its possible he thinks you expect him to be good at sex given his age and since he doesnt have much experience he knows hes not and that makes him overthink and get nervous,Mentalcomposer
youve also only been dating for 3 months and as close as you are he might still need to be even more comfortable with you to be intimate,Mentalcomposer
dont stress over it and dont rush either,Mentalcomposer
the problem with roaches in an apt building is that even if your gf bombs her place with the strongest stuff she can find shes gonna get them back again because her neighbors will still have them and roaches will eventually get back to hers,Mentalcomposer
thats why the whole building needs to be treated at the same time and even then theres no guarantee,Mentalcomposer
why didnt you use the same stuff on your gf apt that you used on your place,Mentalcomposer
roaches aside youre mean to your gf the coat incident was inexcusable,Mentalcomposer
i agree i love a loaded salad its a complete meal,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
so you make your gf leave your place after seeing one roach and that made her cry but then call her back to open presents,Mentalcomposer
then you gift her a used coat and when she doesnt want to wear it to this party you make her feel bad about it and tell her youll give it to someone else  of course shes gonna cry,Mentalcomposer
whats wrong with you  do you even like your gf,Mentalcomposer
she cannot help the roach problem you do know that right im sorry one hitched a ride over to your place but it happens,Mentalcomposer
then you get insulted she wont wear the coat because she wants to wear the other one she also just got and you go off on her,Mentalcomposer
leave her alone or be a nicer person,Mentalcomposer
ok so not a therapist makes the scene a bit better at least,Mentalcomposer
but also not really therapy more like a self help audiobook,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
i didnt watch past episode 1 but what kind of therapy is this,Mentalcomposer
and what ethical therapist would agree to have another person in a session taping it,Mentalcomposer
what kind of explanation could they possibly give to the therapist to make them agree to this,Mentalcomposer
there are two things going on here and they are both on her to address,Mentalcomposer
first the physical pain she is having is clearly not normal she needs to see a gyno and see what is available as far as treatment is concerned has she never seen a gyno or just never brought up this problem,Mentalcomposer
the second is her mentally she needs to address the fact that she cannot open up to you due to whatever happened to her,Mentalcomposer
this is non negotiable sex is as much mental as it is physical and she needs to address both of these for you two to have a healthy sex life,Mentalcomposer
you need to let her know that a healthy sex life is something you are not willing to forgo and that its up to her to get the help she needs or you dont see this relationship lasting,Mentalcomposer
its just that simple,Mentalcomposer
this is not a blame thing its just a fact that she is the one with the issues and shes not addressing them,Mentalcomposer
i also thought that at 20 its cute to wear your bf initial,Mentalcomposer
at 24 and after 4 years you grow out of the cute phase,Mentalcomposer
the thing is hes not really criticizing,Mentalcomposer
in your example he is saying that you should automatically know what he needs,Mentalcomposer
like are you supposed to read his mind  hes an ass just for that comment alone,Mentalcomposer
thats not bad communication thats a normal every day question that people would ask another when they see them a bit out of sorts,Mentalcomposer
and you had nothing to apologize for you did nothing wrong,Mentalcomposer
but i do agree with him that once you know what the problem is its better to ask to help instead of solve the problem for him those two statements arent really interchangeable,Mentalcomposer
overall his ego and self importance is way over the top hes not being honest hes trying so hard to prove to you and everyone else that hes so much better than you and them and when you and they dont come to that realization he outright tells them and you,Mentalcomposer
i give you credit for sticking it out for all those years,Mentalcomposer
yup i did,Mentalcomposer
so of course i had to read the whole thing,Mentalcomposer
can i point out that we havent gained a new wealth your bf has access to his savings acct,Mentalcomposer
otherwise you are nta but your sister owes an apology to your bf,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what kind of weird crap is this,Mentalcomposer
im guessing you had no boyfriends until now and hes not even really a bf youre just hanging out  but not really cause you havent even seen him  just the fact that you physically leave the house freaks out your dad so of course the solution is to make you live elsewhere,Mentalcomposer
theres got to be more to this are you a deeply religious family is it usual to have an arranged marriage is the boy a diff religion race anything,Mentalcomposer
and whats with your mom not thinking your dad is a complete and utter wackadoodle and telling him so,Mentalcomposer
id say run as far and fast as you can cause your parents are nuts  grandmas is looking better and better but i know you cant do that,Mentalcomposer
dont get stuff just for the sake of having,Mentalcomposer
pick walk art knick backs that actually have some meaning to them or youll end up with useless clutter,Mentalcomposer
every wall or shelf doesnt have to be full,Mentalcomposer
buy what you need and use what you buy once,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with your son  there must be something because 10 year olds arent usually this cruel and whats with him opening gifts before xmas  yeah somethings not right here,Mentalcomposer
im worried what hes going to do to his sister to get back at her for him not getting any gifts,Mentalcomposer
thats how i saw it,Mentalcomposer
once her dad got the letter it became his property and he should be allowed to do with it whatever he wants,Mentalcomposer
can someone explain the court case where she sued the mail about the letter,Mentalcomposer
did the court find in her favor without a trial,Mentalcomposer
and then when knauf gave his evidence which clearly showed she lied to the court did the court really just chalk it up to her not remembering writing a slew of emails,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
awesome  thanks putting it on my list,Mentalcomposer
do you mean its not a fun ship  in general what are the entertainment options,Mentalcomposer
i really like the look of this ship but i want some fun activities not all out crazy but i dont want the ship to be quiet by 10 pm,Mentalcomposer
hows the casino if you went,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
so you hate your lying   cheating secretive bf and you think your biggest issue is trying to figure out how not to have sex with him,Mentalcomposer
do you think hes suddenly going to have an epiphany of  wow my gf wont have sex with me better change my ways so she doesnt leave me,Mentalcomposer
hes not going to therapy hes not going to change and hes not leaving,Mentalcomposer
the quicker you admit this the better you will be,Mentalcomposer
yeah ive always thought the opposite,Mentalcomposer
i always wondered how many people they actually convert or even convince to check out the religion,Mentalcomposer
they really dont start the conversation with a compelling argument its usually a boring can i talk to you about,Mentalcomposer
i think they like having to go on these missions just to see diff areas of the country,Mentalcomposer
hell tell you he appreciates all you do so that youll keep doing everything,Mentalcomposer
this right here is what you will be dealing with if you marry him he will not suddenly begin to pull his weight and his video game addiction will not just stop,Mentalcomposer
think long  and hard about if thats what you want in 3510 years,Mentalcomposer
nothing else to be said you said it perfectly,Mentalcomposer
this is what she needs to hear and what she needs to do,Mentalcomposer
congratulations  you should be proud of yourself im proud of you too,Mentalcomposer
if the filled bread is put in a panini press i call that a panini,Mentalcomposer
if i grill the bread filled with ham and cheese in a pan on the stove top then its a grilled ham and cheese,Mentalcomposer
toast to me is just toasted bread topped with something  butter jellyetc and is eaten one slice at a time not put together like a sandwich,Mentalcomposer
and a sandwich is just two slices of bread with a filling whether its toasted or not,Mentalcomposer
there is absolutely no reason for your wife to get that worked up over something so trivial ten minutes is not going to make a difference did she even feel bad about co ti king to blow up at you,Mentalcomposer
partners can only take so much abuse before they snap and you did but at least you recognize that its not a point you want to get to ever again so thats good,Mentalcomposer
time for some serious lay down the rules talk if she does this frequently explain that its not making a happy home for anyone especially your children she should not be ranting and raving over everything,Mentalcomposer
if its a one off find out why this day in particular she was so obsessed with d being ready at the exact time and by making a huge deal of it im sure she didnt leave when she wanted to anyway,Mentalcomposer
so what exactly did she achieve she achieved having her h disgusted by the her behavior and ultimately his own,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how cheap is he that 40 is a big deal,Mentalcomposer
he knew it was going to be too big so its not really a surprise,Mentalcomposer
you didnt have another bag which he also knew so what did he expect you to do magically produce another bag out of nowhere,Mentalcomposer
your h is an ass,Mentalcomposer
im leaning toward you being the ah but not on purpose youre young and probably havent had to make big decisions yet between a so and your mom and its overwhelming,Mentalcomposer
youve only been together 7 mo you see each other all the time over the course of the year and youre both pretty young,Mentalcomposer
i sympathize with your gf its obviously a terrible situation but she has family that can help her deal with grieving and while it would be great to be there for her its not like she will be alone,Mentalcomposer
plus im guessing this is the first time youre meeting her family they might not want an outsider around at this time,Mentalcomposer
on the other hand your mother is alone and im sure was looking forward to your visit its one of the few times she gets to see you all year,Mentalcomposer
go home and spend the holiday with your mom your gf has support but i would do anything for my mom and would never leave her alone on a holiday yes its only one day but the thought of my mom celebrating all alone with no joy on the day would kill me,Mentalcomposer
of course my thought is that you actually like and get along with your mom if you dont get along and dread going home ever then take the out and stay away,Mentalcomposer
i think they are both trying to guilt you into doing what they want make up your own mind what do you think is the right thing to do in your heart and your mind,Mentalcomposer
edit  i just saw your mom could spend xmas with your aunt and uncle and isnt alone alone,Mentalcomposer
so no judgement still but id go home anyway,Mentalcomposer
how long are you with your gf and also do you go to the same school or only see her occasionally,Mentalcomposer
why are you even going to your dads if he treats you badly youre old enough to decide where you want to be for holidays,Mentalcomposer
where is your mom spending xmas,Mentalcomposer
i would think your mom would love to spend the first xmas after her husband passed with people who also  loved him,Mentalcomposer
also is your mom the mother of your sis and nephew that passed  even more reason to spend it with her,Mentalcomposer
yta theyre both your nephews treat them the same or when the older one finally figures it out he wont want anything to do with you because of your disdain for him,Mentalcomposer
you might think the 20 yo is just being a bum and not actually finding himself but he may actually be trying to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
from experience  not mine tho,Mentalcomposer
some guys dont want college but they also cannot see themselves sitting in an office all day but they also cant see themselves doing an outside trade job,Mentalcomposer
yes its irrational  as it was to me to hear  to you because there arent many other alternatives but at some point they get a spark of something and it all comes together for them,Mentalcomposer
give him time you dont have to like it  it hes not your kid,Mentalcomposer
i literally laughed out loud at that,Mentalcomposer
so i guess chris isnt allowed out of the bed until she gets her cuddles in,Mentalcomposer
what a ridiculously immature thing to think as a 26 yo never mind text to the mother of his child,Mentalcomposer
youre not a loser nobody is a loser,Mentalcomposer
do you have a roommate why arent you friendly with him,Mentalcomposer
join a club at your school or an intramural team or volunteer somewhere on campus,Mentalcomposer
or just start saying hi and talking to every  person you see in your dorm building,Mentalcomposer
why havent you done this the first week you were on campus when literally every club was looking for people,Mentalcomposer
youre not gonna make friends if you shut yourself away nobody is gonna come knocking on your door and say hi i want to be your friend,Mentalcomposer
and dont worry so much about attracting girls because with your attitude of thinking of yourself as a loser girls sense that and they want no part of it,Mentalcomposer
the gym is good as long as you go to better yourself and not just to attract someone,Mentalcomposer
get out there and just do something the pieces will all fall into place,Mentalcomposer
we just did a dinner out with immediate family godparents and grandparents,Mentalcomposer
your argument against judging by todays standard is spot on,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to like what the person did or stood for in their time but the fact remains that it was acceptable in their time it happened and was celebrated,Mentalcomposer
key point is  at that time,Mentalcomposer
better to show those statues and have a discussion about the person the act the time in history than to lock them away and never discuss to understand what was going on at that time,Mentalcomposer
that is history for good or bad,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
how old is your son his kids and your younger kids,Mentalcomposer
does your dil work,Mentalcomposer
we used to rent strollers and when we returned the stroller we were given one but only 1 around 9700,Mentalcomposer
thats where i got mine,Mentalcomposer
they are in the photo albums from the trip,Mentalcomposer
yes,Mentalcomposer
and honestly if they would drop the titles and go on their merry way without any mention of his mom his family her family the press i would wish them well in their merchandising endeavors  well id really be rooting for failure but,Mentalcomposer
just go do whatever the hell you want to do as just h and or m write a blog do a reality show pick a cause and champion it just please no more podcasts that was painful just leave everyone else the hell alone and live your freakin life already,Mentalcomposer
ive been keeping up saw a bunch of clips read a bunch my post just tipped the iceberg as you probably know,Mentalcomposer
cant wait for the fallout from the book,Mentalcomposer
only the first episode,Mentalcomposer
did i miss something,Mentalcomposer
we loved that ride  sad to see it go,Mentalcomposer
and we dont really like the new railroad thing,Mentalcomposer
some rides are just classic and shouldnt be messed with,Mentalcomposer
oh where to start,Mentalcomposer
this might get long,Mentalcomposer
try to figure out how they met theres been about 3 diff versions,Mentalcomposer
2 diff versions of the proposal and one that she filmed and live streamed to a friend who does that,Mentalcomposer
now they might want these things to be private but then why even talk about it on a netflix show and out out diff versions,Mentalcomposer
pretty strong evidence that she had been planning to merchandise her and h and the royal connection since before they were married,Mentalcomposer
she lies about her childhood dumps her dad who raised her and suddenly her mom is in the picture to capitalize on her mixed race when up until then she was self identifying as white that rubs ppl the wrong way,Mentalcomposer
add in her admission of wanting to harm herself while pregnant but then not getting any help while being principals in a mh foundation never mind h admitting he didnt know how to get her help and the fam would not help when they didnt really ask for it,Mentalcomposer
m being on a royal tour complaining that shes not getting paid for this,Mentalcomposer
then she and harry are saying she was discriminated against based on her race if it happened they are right to call it out but they have not given one instance of it its all vague cryptic statements,Mentalcomposer
she claims being harassed by paparazzi but there is no evidence of that she claims the fam leaked stories to the press yet no evidence she didnt like negative stories in the press and wanted the fam to get them taken down the fam doesnt have that power but she took it as they wanted to slam her,Mentalcomposer
add in h harping on all day long about his dead mom and his generational pain and its just become a clown show at this point and a lot of his behavior has come out since hes been with her so what has she said or done to him to make him turn on his family,Mentalcomposer
she wants to be a globally known brand she wants fame and money and status shes been trying to do this for almost all of her adult life it hasnt happened even with her marrying into a very famous and influential family and shes grasping at whatever will keep her name in the spotlight,Mentalcomposer
hes just a middle aged man who gained weight and is in his own home where he can be comfortable,Mentalcomposer
we all have spent days just lounging around looking sloppy and so have our partners,Mentalcomposer
he looks presentable when he needs to cut him some slack on this one,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
this is an absolute nothing your gf is being ridiculous good lord its like middle school,Mentalcomposer
your gf is getting upset over your passcode  read that again your passcode on your phone,Mentalcomposer
you must be the most perfect man on the planet if this is the thing shes choosing to get upset about,Mentalcomposer
i dont care if youre good or bad with tech or know how to change it there is no reason to and thats what you should tell her,Mentalcomposer
mazda 3,Mentalcomposer
were on our third one,Mentalcomposer
the 2009 is still being driven by first kid,Mentalcomposer
2014 is now the second kids car,Mentalcomposer
2017  is ours,Mentalcomposer
how else are we supposed supposed to hear his generational pain if hes not the one speaking,Mentalcomposer
how will we know how tortured his life was,Mentalcomposer
maybe hell choke up a bit at timesreally try to pull at the heartstrings,Mentalcomposer
if were really lucky we might get an actual sob,Mentalcomposer
yta for putting up with that loser and his freeloading sister and her kids,Mentalcomposer
why are you with him  he obviously doesnt give a crap about you,Mentalcomposer
give yourself the biggest gift this year your independence from him,Mentalcomposer
you just started talking and youre already spoiling her  in what way,Mentalcomposer
she comes with a lot going on  living with baby daddy not financially independent and has 2 very very young kids you cannot possibly want to take on all of that can you afford to support all 4 of you and more importantly do you even want to,Mentalcomposer
im getting not on the up and up vibes from her id pass on this one there really isnt any upside for you,Mentalcomposer
i dont get angry or upset it just causes unconscious eye rolling which id like to avoid,Mentalcomposer
any qs where someone wants their so to basically have zero contact with anyone of the opposite sex no talking no friends on sm,Mentalcomposer
friends from childhood gone,Mentalcomposer
lab partners  gone,Mentalcomposer
study buddies  gone,Mentalcomposer
co workers they talk to  gone,Mentalcomposer
exes  gone,Mentalcomposer
theres only one person who they should cut contact with and that would be an affair partner and you,Mentalcomposer
you arent mature enough no matter your age to be in a relationship if you have this view,Mentalcomposer
edit and as soon as i posted the next feed is my bf is still friends with his ex,Mentalcomposer
insert eyeroll,Mentalcomposer
the driving might just be an age thing as stupid as that sounds but teens speed i might also let whoever that minor in the car with him that asking him to go faster is a def no go,Mentalcomposer
the more concerning part for me is when you said that when things are going well in life he feels uncomfortable,Mentalcomposer
if he doesnt know now might be a good time to open up about his moms behavior over the years is your ex actually diagnosed or are her issues your best guess,Mentalcomposer
if diagnosed it might help to move your son to be more open to therapy if he can see what his future may look like if he doesnt get a handle on it now,Mentalcomposer
its tough because you dont want him to think that you think  in his teen mind hes crazy or mental or insane or any other euphemism he might use so tread carefully,Mentalcomposer
and why isnt knauf just releasing these writings,Mentalcomposer
i also find it hysterical that they seem to think knauf is biased because he was working for william,Mentalcomposer
they left and the guy had no job he was obviously good at whatever he did enough that the dumb dumb duo used him as their go between with amid the scabies,Mentalcomposer
so the royal household or office or whatever gave him another job was he supposed to just disappear into oblivion after being used by the despicable duo,Mentalcomposer
no not normally,Mentalcomposer
they might thank their parents and their guests for coming but this,Mentalcomposer
this is just cringy,Mentalcomposer
if you have to convince anyone that you have a grand love story than you dont have one,Mentalcomposer
unless she just doesnt,Mentalcomposer
whats gonna happen the rf wont allow a scene to be made,Mentalcomposer
they will once again do and say and get away with whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
best the fam can do is have them sit in the cheap seats along with other non family members,Mentalcomposer
maybe think of it this way you were the handful and got the attention you needed enough so that you cant even remember what you were doing to warrant all that extra support and wasnt it nice that your parents were there to do that h,Mentalcomposer
now its your bro needing the extra and youre upset but you need not be because his time needing the extra will end at some point,Mentalcomposer
then all will go back to normal with your parents being annoyingly up your butt again  cause thats what we do,Mentalcomposer
its hard trying to be the all for everyone at any given time one kid or the other will need more and we have to give it and yes sometimes at the expense of the other kid but it all will even out in the end,Mentalcomposer
if you get to the point where you have a problem or issue that seriously needs to be addressed then you voice that to your mom or dad and ask for some one on one time outside of the house to concentrate on that one issue if they say no then you reiterate that this is important and youre not just being whiny,Mentalcomposer
but i will say that just feeling like they arent validating your existence isnt really serious if and thats only if your bros issues are a serious thing i dont know what hes dealing with,Mentalcomposer
it should revive itself once the kids get a little bigger,Mentalcomposer
but you have to keep it somewhat going or it becomes the new norm,Mentalcomposer
like its not gonna be ok the kids are all somewhat self sufficient enough to not be all energy consuming and youll both have this unbridled passion for each other,Mentalcomposer
it needs to be a constant even if its a once a month type thing now thats at least a constant then it becomes twice a month and then once a week or whatever,Mentalcomposer
is there anyway to heat the mm tube enough to soften the butter and banana enough that you can get the cylinder out maybe boil some water and put the tube in it for a few seconds,Mentalcomposer
or try to cut the tube with a scissor,Mentalcomposer
i am kind of curious how this situation happened if you dont mind sharing,Mentalcomposer
maybe some scratch offs small keychains packs of sports cards mini candies,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt buy one but if you get an actual card then i could see people buying it,Mentalcomposer
just for the historical implication of it,Mentalcomposer
theres no doubt all his ridiculousness will be written about at some point might be kind of worth it to have one maybe,Mentalcomposer
thats the only reason i bought the 5 campaign buttons just to have a little piece of history because hes just that absurd  please dont slam me for this yes i know it was another 5 in his coffers but whatever,Mentalcomposer
do these two actually believe anyone gives a rats ass where they are at any given point in time,Mentalcomposer
in case they or their minions follow along here no,Mentalcomposer
the answer is no,Mentalcomposer
nobody cares go away,Mentalcomposer
while i agree there will be headlines either way but what will they look,Mentalcomposer
like,Mentalcomposer
will it be they were snubbed and rightly so  which seems to be the way its going with the response to the docuwhine or because of what the book says or whatever else they just feel like vaguely moaning about,Mentalcomposer
or,Mentalcomposer
will it be the rf or kc is too soft on his wayward son and what will it take to finally be done with them how far is too far he literally called his father a liar  what he lied about is still anybody guess as they never give any concrete statements so i guess kc can use that as an excuse,Mentalcomposer
weve got a few months so lets see what else happens,Mentalcomposer
lady hussey really should have declined to even meet her,Mentalcomposer
what did she get out of it  nothing the damage has already been done its not like marlene took the blame and admitted it was all a set up,Mentalcomposer
theres no way i would ever even want to make all nice with that conniving grifter,Mentalcomposer
for me the gospel choir at the wedding would have been a beautiful addition if and only if megan or even just her mom had a longstanding relationship with a church that actually has a gospel choir hell even if she used to go as a child  and stopped as an adult to a church with one maybe she did and i missed that little fact,Mentalcomposer
i could be wrong but i equate gospel choirs with a predominantly black church which i actually like i think it makes the service idk less boring and it adds to the service lets face it church service is boring,Mentalcomposer
so the fact they added the choir literally just to play into her woc persona just didnt sit well with me as much as i enjoyed watching it,Mentalcomposer
i agree but his gf already doesnt want to stay at borgata,Mentalcomposer
we stay and play at b even tho we havent won there,Mentalcomposer
oh this made me think of something,Mentalcomposer
maybe it wasnt leaks to make them look bad but merely something they were doing in an official capacity but like everything else she does she missteps during it and thats what gets picked up by the journalists,Mentalcomposer
so for example if they visited a hospital of sick kids she refuses to touch or hug the kids   the paper would say yeah they visited but she was repulsed by sick kids or something like that,Mentalcomposer
so the story was bad but not by any fault of the family or palace,Mentalcomposer
stay at borgata for the free room and go over to ocean to play,Mentalcomposer
if youre going very soon be prepared that borgata is in the midst of renovating some slot areas there are a bunch of closed off sections so it looks messy,Mentalcomposer
if your gf doesnt really want to go anyway shell def not like it once she sees it,Mentalcomposer
but shell pick and choose select lines from long posts that are someone commenting things like what if is it possible allegedly and i heard a rumor that,Mentalcomposer
and then say see theyre spreading all these lies,Mentalcomposer
shes not gonna show a post saying they did this on this day and then said this on this day whats the truth,Mentalcomposer
or posts that point out evidence of her obvious lies,Mentalcomposer
of course its gayle he wont be asked about anything thats been revealed as being a lie or deceitful,Mentalcomposer
shell lob softball qs that have been answered ad nauseam in three diff ways maybe hell have a fourth answer,Mentalcomposer
who at this point will even watch this drivel,Mentalcomposer
unless its live and a respectable hard hitting journalist i think im busy cleaning bathrooms that day,Mentalcomposer
i love this idea,Mentalcomposer
maybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom  because she does actually have a live mom even tho she doesnt see her might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with just so the little girl doesnt feel totally rejected,Mentalcomposer
its possible his collar is visible when hes carrying lilly that way,Mentalcomposer
if the collar is not buttoned all the way up like if you are wearing a tie they are actually roomy plus the front of the shirt would just slide up,Mentalcomposer
plus shes a small child she can def fit between his collar and his neck,Mentalcomposer
i dont know if its photo shopped or not but the collar is not a smoking gun to me,Mentalcomposer
but what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda after breaking up,Mentalcomposer
and if it was while they were together again what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda while dating a nobody,Mentalcomposer
i think they dont want to get pulled into her crazy,Mentalcomposer
i think youre getting ahead of yourself here,Mentalcomposer
lets say that someone legitimately not mentally ill gets kidnapped gmafb they will be placed assessed and have you ever thought that maybe just maybe they will be referred to somewhere that will help address whatever their issue is since its not mh this is a good thing,Mentalcomposer
you seem to think an actual mental health provider is going to hold people that dont need their services when in actuality those providers want to free up space for the ones that they can actually help,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for abuse everywhere give the program a chance before you condemn it,Mentalcomposer
you say if they want to help then get to the root cause  well thats exactly what they are trying to do,Mentalcomposer
we were one of the million that actually watched the show we liked it too but even back then i remember i didnt like her character and it wasnt personal to her just didnt like her storyline,Mentalcomposer
but it never registered to me that she was mixed race i wasnt looking for it i dont remember it being in any plot line and i just didnt make the connection until her dad was introduced and then was like   huh shes black then happily went back to watching and even now i dont remember if there was any substantial plot regarding her race but i could be wrong there,Mentalcomposer
all this is for nothing if theyre not even invited,Mentalcomposer
would anyone really be surprised if they werent,Mentalcomposer
dont announce theyre not invited and maybe use their pr to ask media to not even mention the are they arent they invited,Mentalcomposer
im sure m will make it known but if the uk press doesnt report it how much traction can they get  after a while the us press will realize they as a whole are a non story,Mentalcomposer
no one treated her like a black person,Mentalcomposer
because no one even knew she was half black  kind of what happens when you yourself hide that info,Mentalcomposer
of course when she starts to date h did anyone care to want to know anything about her background as would have happened with anyone he dated lets be real the press would have dug into anyones background and found the worst things they could,Mentalcomposer
but notice she has no instances of how she was treated differently,Mentalcomposer
the compton and chimp thing was over the line no doubt but as pointed out those were condemned by the press against the press,Mentalcomposer
if they release any recordings even if its so called shocking people who dont really have an opinion either way will suddenly have one and it wont be in their favor,Mentalcomposer
regular every day people know that families arent perfect and have their dirty laundry but we dont air it,Mentalcomposer
same kraft is great when i want quick but homemade is a treat to myself,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
sorry but ywbta to demolish it,Mentalcomposer
the prudent thing to do is to sell it and split the proceeds among the kids,Mentalcomposer
i can sort of understand your attachment to the home you built but really youll be dead you wont know or care who will be living there,Mentalcomposer
and think about it this way,Mentalcomposer
from your description whoever buys it will be wealthy and will go in and change it to how they like it and that might upset you to think about but its going to become someone elses dream house another family that will raise their children to have the happy childhood that you were able to give your kids that legacy alone should give you some peace,Mentalcomposer
the worst part of this whole story is that your kids are already fighting over who deserves the house more,Mentalcomposer
im sorry what here i was thinking your kids had an awesome upbringing going and then we see that they have turned into greedy self serving adults,Mentalcomposer
cause lets face it one of them will get the house maybe live there till they realize its too expensive to maintain it and then theyll sell it anyway and keep that windfall,Mentalcomposer
in the process their sibling relationships will fail,Mentalcomposer
stipulate to sell the house if one of your kids can afford it they are more than welcome to bid on it,Mentalcomposer
well that blows my theory out thanks tho its good for me to know going forward,Mentalcomposer
i probably wouldnt be able to do a perfectly proper curtsy if i was put on the spot  which is a ridiculous claim that she didnt even know the q was going to be there but id sure as hell try to do something genuine looking,Mentalcomposer
the q seemed to have a funny side so if it came out looking like a baby deer learning to walk shed probably laugh it off id be mortified but id apologize anyway and promise to learn the diff is i would actually learn how,Mentalcomposer
but that witch of a champion of women feels its beneath her to even to the most esteemed woman in the world,Mentalcomposer
my theory is that when you first start out it allows for typos and small errors like missing accent marks,Mentalcomposer
as you progress it marks them wrong because it thinks you should know that by now,Mentalcomposer
as of now i havent been marked wrong for the accent marks yet and i hope it doesnt happen in the future,Mentalcomposer
im only unit 6 so still early and i may be wrong but words that i misspell are usually many letters so its easy to misspell when starting out but the ones that ive seen for a while get marked wrong,Mentalcomposer
she cant get specific because everything they said happened didnt,Mentalcomposer
its too easy to go back to that person and have them refute it all,Mentalcomposer
and they think theyre smarter than literally every single other person on the planet and that we wouldnt see right thru that,Mentalcomposer
at this point they can have a public ccv camera that recorded literally any mundane thing that they did and i still wouldnt believe it happened if it came from them,Mentalcomposer
they have lost all credibility and rightly so,Mentalcomposer
or she just doesnt like the name harry she thinks william got the cooler name  h isnt a very oooular name in the us i dont think,Mentalcomposer
who knows in her deluded mind,Mentalcomposer
do you think she calls him hazbeen when shes raging at him  that would be priceless,Mentalcomposer
i do agree with taking some time to cool off if you say thats what youre doing and its a short amount of time walk around the block go for a drive but op also says she went and stayed with her parents for a few weeks,Mentalcomposer
thats not really a cooling off period seems more like trying to solve that problem from afar and we dont know if h took a small time to cool off or hes still gone,Mentalcomposer
but again a short cooling off period is sometimes a good thing,Mentalcomposer
especially that both of them have left the home after an argument,Mentalcomposer
that is not a healthy way to resolve conflict,Mentalcomposer
love that last line  its so simple but so true,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
of course your son would be upset with you,Mentalcomposer
do you really think he would tell you hes gay if hes not or if hes not sure  he has a boyfriend even,Mentalcomposer
how your son looks or his hobbies and interests have absolutely no bearing in regard to his sexuality i dont know why you would even think that,Mentalcomposer
you owe him a huge apology if hed even accept it,Mentalcomposer
be a better parent,Mentalcomposer
im sorry but i am failing to see what you are so mad about,Mentalcomposer
are you mad because they lied to you all these years,Mentalcomposer
well id be willing to bet that there have been a lot of people who over the years have lied to you about one thing or another this lie really has no bearing on your life it hasnt made it better and it def hasnt made it worse this is an absolute nothing i find it extremely hard to believe if you have never lied to anyone why was it ok for you to tell a lie but not anyone else,Mentalcomposer
or are you mad about the age gap being what it is,Mentalcomposer
in which case that really is not your business they were both adults when they got together and thats really the only thing that matters,Mentalcomposer
they have stayed together so that in itself should show you that they are happy together,Mentalcomposer
now you may feel a bit weirded out by the gap but that is your personal moral code and you have no right to impose or pass judgement on anyone even if its your dad,Mentalcomposer
it seems you are taking this news way too personal as if something was done to you your life was a happy one with sam in it why would you purposefully make problems when there really isnt one,Mentalcomposer
why are you even looking at 3 br homes,Mentalcomposer
your realtor should not even be showing you them,Mentalcomposer
keep looking you will find a 4 bed that will call to you just as much as this one and you will be grateful when 2 teen girls are not fighting over space,Mentalcomposer
i have 5 siblings i can honestly say i have rarely bought any of them gifts for their bday and i like and get along and hang out with all of them,Mentalcomposer
it just isnt a thing occasionally if its a big bday and theyre having a party for it then ill get a gift 253050th,Mentalcomposer
as far as im concerned parents get gifts for everything,Mentalcomposer
if this is your partners only sib then an xmas gift is ok since shed be left out when every one is opening gifts,Mentalcomposer
but id stop the bday gifts,Mentalcomposer
ah thank you i was obviously confused,Mentalcomposer
i thought the prince title could never be removed and i thought the king couldnt remove the duke title that it had to be done by parliament and that this bill would give the king the power,Mentalcomposer
good to know parliament can at least do some stripping of titles at some point,Mentalcomposer
ill refrain from commenting till i understand the whole issue it does get confusing,Mentalcomposer
personally id like both titles stripped from h he hasnt lived up to either of them,Mentalcomposer
as far as andrew as long as he keeps himself hidden away i can wait for his turn in the next round  not that i condone anything he has done but hes at least staying within the bounds the q set for him,Mentalcomposer
parliament doing the stripping would be the best thing that could happen,Mentalcomposer
maybe kc can put out a weakly worded statement in opposition just to appear to give a sht but if it comes from above him theres nothing he can do about it,Mentalcomposer
maybe parliament can throw around some key words treason grievous harm prosecute etc,Mentalcomposer
youre not the only one who doesnt drink just dont make a big deal out of it or talk about those that do,Mentalcomposer
go to the parties grab a soda and have fun nobody is going to know or care,Mentalcomposer
since i have no experience in nursing but frequently am the visitor to a patient frequently admitted  chronic issues,Mentalcomposer
i like the idea that i can go in to visit and connect with a nurse to give me the daily update too often i have no idea what the diagnosis actually is and the waiting for a nurse to have the time to come in and advise is usually long i dont think that aspect harms patient care many times i have questions later on and this would be helpful,Mentalcomposer
i dont have an issue with a virtual doing paperwork things like discharges but maybe the actual on site nurse should have to sign off on the paperwork thats been prepared thats a good check and balance in case something has been missed or overlooked by the virtual that isnt actually seeing the medical state of a patient,Mentalcomposer
im not sure about admission assessments i would think theres a lot of nuances that in person can pick up on i would think patients especially older folks would downplay their illness pain uncomfort but in house might pick up on all this,Mentalcomposer
the idea of a virtual monitoring labs or electronic monitoring info may prove helpful but only if its being done in a timely manner sort of like what good is a lab report that needs immediate action if its not being looked at immediately no matter whose looking,Mentalcomposer
theres always a fear with this that virtual nurses will evolve into doing too much and things will slip thru the cracks almost like how if an in house nurse is so busy the virtuals will eventually become too overloaded as well because really they still need to be paid and it does seem that hospitals are all about cutting expenses anyway,Mentalcomposer
do you think a program like this could eventually lead to too few actual nurses on the floor and what could that mean for patient care,Mentalcomposer
thanks for posting its certainly an interesting idea,Mentalcomposer
those eco warriors dont you just love them,Mentalcomposer
but if it was a borrowed plane its ok right  all the carbon footprints are someone elses,Mentalcomposer
oh its for security they say  yes well theyre doing such good things in the world someone just must be after them to stop them from ridding the world of all those racists,Mentalcomposer
did i miss any other excuses,Mentalcomposer
if they were editing based on public opinion there would be no show,Mentalcomposer
what they should be doing is taking what they say and present the other factual side of the whole damn story,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
stay at your brothers and dont even answer her texts,Mentalcomposer
she needs to learn that she cant keep pushing shes going to have to figure out a way to not need constant attention from you,Mentalcomposer
take your time to figure out what you want to say then text her with that,Mentalcomposer
dont get into a pissing match with her about your action of leaving just concentrate on her actions her actions had consequences too bad so sad,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
seriously how long are you going to coddle the 24 yo,Mentalcomposer
she obviously has horrible taste in men and if i had to guess your and her dads marriage wasnt great and thats part of the reason why,Mentalcomposer
she needs help but in the professional way not mommy cleaning up after the fact,Mentalcomposer
do you not remember when your older kids were in hs and how important dances proms plays sporting events were,Mentalcomposer
you have done this all 4 times but your d is doing all this for the first time  think about that for a bit,Mentalcomposer
thats the kinda the point,Mentalcomposer
it was 1 day that you specifically asked for and he couldnt even just handle it and not moan about it,Mentalcomposer
and this 1 day was when you were going to give birth to his child,Mentalcomposer
but good luck today may your labor be quick and painless my third was the easiest delivery and the easiest baby too,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your h really couldnt help  and i hate that he even thinks hes helping when its his kids get the kids situated one morning,Mentalcomposer
i was a sahm for all my kids i readily volunteered for all night stuff because my h had to get up early for work,Mentalcomposer
but if i had a bad night or couldnt settle the baby and woke him he never bitched and moaned about it he got up did what he had to do and went back to sleep,Mentalcomposer
was he a bit more tired at work im sure but weve all been tired at work for whatever reason,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand a partner that moans when they have to do one teeny tiny thing other than what has been deemed their chores or their part,Mentalcomposer
like seriously are we partners or are we two people who share space and children,Mentalcomposer
i read one article where h said theres a hierarchy of the family,Mentalcomposer
he cannot be that stupid,Mentalcomposer
like yeah duh,Mentalcomposer
youve been doing this your whole life and just figured out that the monarch comes first the heir second and so on down the line,Mentalcomposer
i really think the dumb duo mean,Mentalcomposer
we wanted to do something and they told us no because cs or ws thing takes precedent,Mentalcomposer
the first snow of the year is always so beautiful isnt it,Mentalcomposer
i hope your pups  enjoyed it,Mentalcomposer
i hate saying this because whats done is done but  you bothered to read about the failure rate about bcps  but that still didnt register to you that you should have been using condoms also i dont fault you for believing her when she said she was on the pill but oh man shes something else,Mentalcomposer
so that out of the way im not judging cause this is just way to big to judge on teenagers,Mentalcomposer
has she even said that she wants to keep the baby thats what you need to ask,Mentalcomposer
then what you do is tell your parents that shes pregnant,Mentalcomposer
you cannot handle this by yourself,Mentalcomposer
again in case you didnt get it the first time,Mentalcomposer
you cannot handle this by yourself,Mentalcomposer
you her and both sets of parents need to sit down and figure out what you are all going to do,Mentalcomposer
you cannot make her get an abortion you may voice your stance that you are not ready to be a dad but she will do what she wants,Mentalcomposer
this is why you need adult parental guidance,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused with this story but why dont you write the letter but not send it,Mentalcomposer
give it to a friend to destroy,Mentalcomposer
maybe just the act of doing it will be enough,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
just for the fact that they are coming on xmas day and also staying for 2 nights,Mentalcomposer
isnt that enough,Mentalcomposer
honestly im surprised theyre not spending the holiday with her dad and or her siblings,Mentalcomposer
we did that the first xmas after my mom passed i usually swap years with my inlaws and it was their turn but i just felt i had to be with my fam  and it was hard,Mentalcomposer
but also that before this move she only moved 20 min away yet they havent seen her in ages,Mentalcomposer
theres is def a reason she doesnt want to see them,Mentalcomposer
im more curious about the tweet never saw that before,Mentalcomposer
id say the acct was hacked just based on the way it sounds but really some random hacker had months to figure out how to get into the acct just to tweet this,Mentalcomposer
what are the chances some hacker was invested in their story so much to spend their time doing this as opposed to idk literally getting into any other legitimately important persons acct,Mentalcomposer
maybe some palace insider just wanted to give them grief whether true or not and planned to tweet and delete on the off chance someone got a screen shot of it,Mentalcomposer
or m did it just to be able to say the rf wanted to ruin her by putting it out there,Mentalcomposer
idk why but i find this hysterical,Mentalcomposer
there is no excuse for what he did you really have no idea what he did with those recordings id be gone,Mentalcomposer
whatever you do one thing would be certain for me never another intimate video call or even a phone call,Mentalcomposer
ooh attacking american values  thats a new one,Mentalcomposer
its not enough the fam didnt like her now lets have them hating a whole country,Mentalcomposer
the only thing that might be somewhat new would be the people who didnt want them to marry,Mentalcomposer
we know william tried to slow h down but were there any others maybe charles or camilla suggested they wait to see if she fits with the fam or if shes up to the kind of life of service thats expected  or simply if she really just wanted h,Mentalcomposer
im sure theyll spin it to because theyre racist when we see now that all those objections would be true,Mentalcomposer
one things for sure h and m will not be telling any stories with any kind of detail that could show any kind of slight against them,Mentalcomposer
such as we were working with a to do a named project and person b did this and then said x,Mentalcomposer
itll all be very superficial i got the impression someone was trying to ruin a project  no name that we were trying to  start up,Mentalcomposer
i hope thats understandable it made sense when i thought it,Mentalcomposer
thats weird thats what fixed mine,Mentalcomposer
i am not techie at all so id say uninstall and reinstall but,Mentalcomposer
only if you remember your login,Mentalcomposer
sorry im out of ideas,Mentalcomposer
update the app,Mentalcomposer
we need to know what your mom said,Mentalcomposer
i had the same,Mentalcomposer
update your app it fixed it for me,Mentalcomposer
so like if he didnt even know the woman was pregnant,Mentalcomposer
yeah id be ok with that  good point,Mentalcomposer
oh geez could you just imagine he asks for a test and hes the one with random offspring out there,Mentalcomposer
way to shoot yourself in the foot,Mentalcomposer
karmas a bitch,Mentalcomposer
one more thought if you have friends that will vouch for you maybe you can ask them to co sign on a lease,Mentalcomposer
that might solve the credit issue,Mentalcomposer
then when the lease comes due and you fix the credit issue you can ask the landlord if they will do another credit check to see if youd be good on your own,Mentalcomposer
sorry just throwing ideas out there,Mentalcomposer
def not a prude its just an unusual situation wanting to see his accomplishment and also what makes this photographer so good at what they do and what they can capture what feelings the photos elicit,Mentalcomposer
as i said have someone cover what you dont want to see,Mentalcomposer
it would then be like what he shows in a bathing suit,Mentalcomposer
but at least youd be able to appreciate the art aspects of the photos,Mentalcomposer
good point about objects blocking his bits,Mentalcomposer
if that was the case she wouldnt be worried about viewing the pics but we really dont know either way youre right,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
that cousin tho wow  i really have no words,Mentalcomposer
you take care of yourself and when you feel back to fighting weight you give that rude condescending ah of a relation a huge verbal ass whooping,Mentalcomposer
family harmony be damned she needs to be called out and called out loudly she needs to be ostracized by the family,Mentalcomposer
you have an income that would afford you a pretty good life,Mentalcomposer
air bnbs are gonna cut into that i would think pretty quickly,Mentalcomposer
instead of trying to get an apt that would have a credit check maybe try to find a roommate situation,Mentalcomposer
after that you need to build more credit cc might not be viable but a monthly subscription to a magazine would help  i did that when i first started out,Mentalcomposer
and dont stop with the credit companies fight until you get an answer from them of what documentation you need to accept the name change and then get it to them  maybe check with a lawyer if what they are doing is even legal and send your docs with a letter from the lawyer,Mentalcomposer
she knows theres a racial divide still in america and she plays off that,Mentalcomposer
this is exactly why she plays it up so much,Mentalcomposer
dont you know she can single handily cure the world of racism if she could just let everyone in the whole wide world know that she and she alone is calling out racism,Mentalcomposer
oh and that pesky resume listing her as white  well the racists in all of hollywood would never ever cast her if they knew she wasnt lily white,Mentalcomposer
shes got nothing else to be victimized for,Mentalcomposer
id want to see them for the art aspect of it but as a mom of grown boys im with you where it seems idk the word  ick no strange maybe just some things moms dont need to see yes,Mentalcomposer
this will sound weird but maybe have someone cover his bits so that you can still see the pictures,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
youre jealous of a then 15 yo when your bf was what 23,Mentalcomposer
get over it already youre punishing a young woman who may have had a teenage crush,Mentalcomposer
i am curious tho how he even met her and were they friends in a sense that at 23 he was hanging out with teens,Mentalcomposer
that would say a lot more about your bf than this girl,Mentalcomposer
at this point  30 years and all kids are adults now and never ever having this convo,Mentalcomposer
go for it  knowing its a total and absolute waste of money,Mentalcomposer
although id probably ask to do something like a 23 and me for all of us this way well get all the ancestry in addition to the bio relationship,Mentalcomposer
kind of curious if all the kids ancestry would be exactly alike,Mentalcomposer
two birds one stone,Mentalcomposer
you know you should get out but why should you leave  if hes done then he can get out,Mentalcomposer
but id worry about my name being on the lease,Mentalcomposer
if its just your name then he leaves,Mentalcomposer
if its both of your names then dont go anywhere until you can figure out something with the landlord to get your name off,Mentalcomposer
if he stops paying youll be on the hook for it,Mentalcomposer
omg just plan to have a meal with each parent and their so if you have to meet them pick a restaurant have a meal then d can go home with gma or gpa for her visit,Mentalcomposer
do you not talk with or visit when you drop off your d  just how amicable is your relationship with each parent,Mentalcomposer
id be more concerned that since your dad is wanted in that country if they have been keeping tabs on him the govt might just know that his wife and d are arriving,Mentalcomposer
but i have no idea what country youre talking about t might be turkey in which case i dont know if id be that comfortable going,Mentalcomposer
just use the vacay money to bring a few relatives to you,Mentalcomposer
other than the house which i agree would cost them a lot of money each month and the nannies what else do they do that they pay for,Mentalcomposer
theyre not jetting around the world on humanitarian missions in which theyd need transport and lodging,Mentalcomposer
theyre not invited to award shows or hell even dinner parties with the a listers in which theyd need to buy something new to wear,Mentalcomposer
i dont pay too much attention to their day to day but theyve gone out to dinner what 2 times  oh and cant forget he uvalde visit,Mentalcomposer
so if they werent so full of themselves and had to have a huge home for 4 of them theyd probably be doing ok,Mentalcomposer
edit  nope they wouldnt be ok,Mentalcomposer
did some digging their monthly expenses are estimated at about 360000 plus repaying the frogmore renovations of 18000 per month  idk maybe 20000,Mentalcomposer
and this is not including landscaping maintenance which i couldnt find,Mentalcomposer
these 2 are screwed,Mentalcomposer
i have no doubt that she can have a platonic relationship with a guy especially if hes a family friend  someones son that her parents were friends with and therefore they grew up together,Mentalcomposer
but if you know for a fact she lied you need to talk about it why did she lie,Mentalcomposer
you say youre young how young,Mentalcomposer
when we are just starting on our dating journey it is possible we lie because we dont want to upset out bf gf of course our inexperience leads us to believe the other person will not know but with social media it always comes out,Mentalcomposer
talk to her in a non accusatory way,Mentalcomposer
you know her best is she coming across as truthful does she seem like shes lying or trying to hide anything from you,Mentalcomposer
what is her reasoning to deceive you while snapping from another guys bed  seriously where was he,Mentalcomposer
honestly if your gut is saying theres more to this there probably is trust it,Mentalcomposer
if youre not long term id say just cut your losses and move on,Mentalcomposer
of course im of an age where we didnt have sm so a lot of this is just bizarre to me,Mentalcomposer
love or need of her,Mentalcomposer
if he ditches her wheres he gonna go,Mentalcomposer
yeah what stakes,Mentalcomposer
there are no stakes its not a competition theres nothing to lose,Mentalcomposer
just go live your fn life and stop making every freakin thing about your what 72 days as a royal,Mentalcomposer
she really is a waste of life,Mentalcomposer
im sorry there is absolutely zero reasons why this bill should not be pushed thru and voted on,Mentalcomposer
it should be obvious to anyone in parliament that these two are not good for the uk never mind the rf,Mentalcomposer
and id be ok with a bill that strips the prince title too  unless its better to try the second born son for treason,Mentalcomposer
in which case im ok with that too,Mentalcomposer
whatever it takes to get them distanced for the rf,Mentalcomposer
dont you want to spend the holiday with your family,Mentalcomposer
if you think this is a long term thing you may as well get used to switching off or just spend it with your own family again and meet up later,Mentalcomposer
dont tell him you hate spending time with his family we all grow up getting used to our own familys way of doing things,Mentalcomposer
try to find something you can relate to with his mom i know its hard you have nothing in common with a middle aged woman,Mentalcomposer
keep it light tv shows local news maybe your job places youve visited etc,Mentalcomposer
and im sure you know no religion or politics,Mentalcomposer
who was taking all these pics,Mentalcomposer
theyre not official royal duty pics so what they had someone follow them around while they were dating before they got engaged during wedding planning  and the rf allowed this,Mentalcomposer
did she plan on a doc that early on,Mentalcomposer
thats some serious long con,Mentalcomposer
and adding in,Mentalcomposer
you know because no one protected my mum and we all know how that ended,Mentalcomposer
im gonna watch it have to see how they spin literally everything to their advantage,Mentalcomposer
but how else will they get sympathy if they dont play up how badly they are suffering if we dont see it,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah i read the daily mail every morning,Mentalcomposer
the amount of articles is unbelievable,Mentalcomposer
clicked one  but only one since i read here about not giving them clicks to read harry saying something about not knowing what goes on behind closed doors,Mentalcomposer
ironic no   considering what probably goes on behind their door,Mentalcomposer
i can just imagine tw waking this morning screeching to hazbeen   look im everywhere,Mentalcomposer
just tell her she agreed to the 100 amazon budget and then spent more with her sis,Mentalcomposer
if she wants more it has to come out of her separate account,Mentalcomposer
its kind of silly to buy so much the first year half the fun is adding on each year and seeing how your tastes are going to change each year,Mentalcomposer
im going to assume your parents have met the bf and like him,Mentalcomposer
that is literally half the battle,Mentalcomposer
but oh boy this has disaster written all over it and i hate to say it but if it goes badly i think itll be your parents fault,Mentalcomposer
off the top of my head,Mentalcomposer
first off you have got to beat into your parents head that they are absolutely not allowed to talk about their wealth at all  no way no how,Mentalcomposer
make them understand that saying anything that might reflect badly on his parents is just not done in polite society,Mentalcomposer
then forewarn his parents about how your parents are maybe explain that your values arent theirs and ask them to please dont get into it with them and to not take anything they may say personally as much as they would want to,Mentalcomposer
who knows tho maybe they will all get along and all your worries are for nothing,Mentalcomposer
good luck,Mentalcomposer
sorry i dont care how close friends they are those kind of flirty messages are never  their way of communication,Mentalcomposer
if you have to live constantly checking his phone hes not worth it youll never get to a place where you trust him again therefore leading to never giving your all to this partner and a relationship needs those things,Mentalcomposer
its really not that hard to not flirt with others if you are truly invested in the one youre with,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
should have done it long ago and just not said anything,Mentalcomposer
she probably wouldnt have even noticed,Mentalcomposer
and really she wont come over anymore second problem solved,Mentalcomposer
keep the album especially if you have kids,Mentalcomposer
both my parents are now passed,Mentalcomposer
my sister happened to take my parents wedding album home from visiting my step dad one day,Mentalcomposer
she brought it over and it was really nice to see them when they were young and in love,Mentalcomposer
they divorced when i was small and my dad passed a few years later,Mentalcomposer
and putting faces to grandparents i dont really remember,Mentalcomposer
they are memories you cannot capture from any other pics that might be floating around,Mentalcomposer
my truth,Mentalcomposer
your truth is your perception of a situation or your opinion or just you lying,Mentalcomposer
there is only the truth,Mentalcomposer
as bizarre as it is that he talked about his book and recounted stories its even more bizarre to me that hed get mad when others tried to change the subject,Mentalcomposer
like what these arent his friends he can get drunk and vent to these are business associates,Mentalcomposer
but i guess when you have no friends youll vent to anyone you can get and if he hadnt made this situation all on his own it would be really sad  but he did so its not,Mentalcomposer
are you upset that he put down single and that he may get in trouble for it,Mentalcomposer
or are you upset that youre not on the house and think if he put down married you would somehow own half the house,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that you havent had so much as a conversation with your mom about any of this,Mentalcomposer
somehow she found out on her own so can you really blame her for being a little salty about the whole situation,Mentalcomposer
she may be in denial or feel  as many parents do that youre just labeling yourself because its popular to do so or she may be just hurt that you didnt come to her when you had this revelation,Mentalcomposer
stop the passive aggressive crap that shows your immaturity and could actually reinforce your moms thinking that you just want a trendy label,Mentalcomposer
have a real honest down to earth talk with your mom,Mentalcomposer
stay calm and explain to her whats going on with you even if she gets excited or nasty or dismissive  hold your ground calmly,Mentalcomposer
she may not jump on board right away either but youre not making any progress as it is,Mentalcomposer
and when she agrees to your pronouns give her some leeway if she slips up  14 years is a long time to call you she her and now shes going to have to think before she addresses you every single time,Mentalcomposer
honestly i would think a nanny would be a useless expense and its not cheap,Mentalcomposer
hes home all day anyway he can take care of the baby and does he not think the baby needs him,Mentalcomposer
it is inconceivable that this man is writing all day every day,Mentalcomposer
most days hes probably not doing any writing at all thats how the writing process works,Mentalcomposer
why does he not want to care and nurture his child,Mentalcomposer
go to the office someone in this marriage has  to sustain this family,Mentalcomposer
just spend what you can easily afford on something that you think she would like,Mentalcomposer
dont forget that after the engagement theres a wedding and a honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
if you blow all your money on one ring you have to scrimp and save for the rest that comes after,Mentalcomposer
yes you are crazy,Mentalcomposer
your bf and his friend actually asked to vacation at your deceased dads house  without you,Mentalcomposer
then when you rightly said no they change their trip conveniently to where you are also going to be vacationing  but youre all not going together  why is that,Mentalcomposer
oh it gets better the friend not even your bf ask again to stay at your dads house oh but again youre not there but shes bringing her friend,Mentalcomposer
just tell them both to go to hell,Mentalcomposer
i do not believe you and bf are so in love that you have to bend over backward to appease not only him but his friend also,Mentalcomposer
and why do you think that,Mentalcomposer
because she stood up to some ah that made fun of your accent,Mentalcomposer
how about you just start standing up for yourself to ppl who make fun of you and to these two users,Mentalcomposer
nta for not entertaining his ridiculousness,Mentalcomposer
its absurd that he would even ask you to give him advice on his relationship youre not a couples counselor,Mentalcomposer
do away with both of them like literally dont even pick up her calls or,Mentalcomposer
texts,Mentalcomposer
they arent even your friends you know her because she is friends with your bfs cousin which at best make you acquaintances,Mentalcomposer
she picked him and wants to stay so let her deal with her own messed up life,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but i want to know how old frank is,Mentalcomposer
this is not your situation to manage,Mentalcomposer
and you dont know or even like this guy if rory and frank want to see each other they have to figure out a way,Mentalcomposer
every time she wants to see him youre gonna somehow get your parents to go visit family in queens  oh and youre just gonna conveniently being your best friend and then what disappear for a few hours to go see frank,Mentalcomposer
oh and her parents are strict about boys so add to this absurd scenario her parents finding out,Mentalcomposer
see how stupid this sounds,Mentalcomposer
really why cant you guys just find some nice boys where you live,Mentalcomposer
youre 15 youre supposed to be figuring out all this dating crap with other teens from school or a club or anywhere closer,Mentalcomposer
and as per usual the revenge dress will fail because it will be ill fitting,Mentalcomposer
the issue is not that you cant lose weight,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to lose weight,Mentalcomposer
the issue is,Mentalcomposer
you know youre at a healthy weight but you want to lose more weight to be skinnier you need to explore why you feel the need to be even smaller than you are,Mentalcomposer
do you see the difference,Mentalcomposer
did you tell the therapist that you are not happy with how you look and that is the reason you want to lose weight have you explained the binging purging and excessive exercise,Mentalcomposer
if you did and their advice was to eat more veggies you need a diff therapist,Mentalcomposer
your weight is perfectly fine you know this you acknowledge youre at a healthy weight,Mentalcomposer
do your parents know about your past  issues with your weight  if not now is a good time to tell them,Mentalcomposer
and if they do now is a good time to tell them,Mentalcomposer
if they dont make sure you see at the least your regular dr if not a therapist then tell a guidance counselor at school,Mentalcomposer
you need to get a handle on this now  before you do irreversible damage to your health,Mentalcomposer
ok im looking at this a bit differently than the other 2 commenters because its not just her whose saying she regrets not being with others you said it too,Mentalcomposer
i think her coworker was totally out of line with his behaviors i cant even imagine what he was thinking so im not gonna comment on that thats a while diff issue,Mentalcomposer
you say that it was rocky at the beginning but its better and you love each other now,Mentalcomposer
i think you need to check in with your wife about that and also do a brutally honest assessment of your own feelings,Mentalcomposer
if yours was truly a loving partnership marriage there really should be no reason to need validation from others on either side,Mentalcomposer
your start was tough because maybe you didnt really know each other that well but after 7 years you both should know if this is your person or not,Mentalcomposer
it shouldnt be we stay together for the son or were just comfortable in our day to day or itll cause too much upheaval to split up or any other superficial excuse you could both come up with,Mentalcomposer
you both should be staying together because this is actually the person you want to be with if its not youre both just prolonging the inevitable,Mentalcomposer
not that i think 28 is old by any stretch but having wild times that you both think you missed out on just isnt going to be the same at 2830 as opposed to 2125 and having sex with other people just for the sake of having sex with other people is a really crappy reason,Mentalcomposer
its time for some real honest soul searching by both of you neither of you can try to spare the others feelings in this if its not working its not working,Mentalcomposer
is she gonna tell all about her early life where her dear mother was thru her childhood all about what her dad has done for her the story about trevor or even better cheating on corey with h,Mentalcomposer
were gonna get her spin  from age 37 thru 41,Mentalcomposer
get out of here with this nonsense what publisher would agree to any of this knowing how neither one of them can actually deliver on what they promise,Mentalcomposer
are you really saying that h would go back to his family and eliminate his brother and all 3 of his kids just so he  and his wife can take the throne,Mentalcomposer
i hate them too but thats just way no to crazy land,Mentalcomposer
wth did i just read,Mentalcomposer
im gonna need to know what the argument was about that made you take a break for a week,Mentalcomposer
so without that some observations,Mentalcomposer
you seem to have a lot of control over him you read his messages and his journal and decide who he can talk too does he always do what you want him to,Mentalcomposer
and that crap about him having to break up with you  no put your big girl panties on and make a decision thats middle school level maturity,Mentalcomposer
you dont want a marriage you want a proposal and wedding so you can pretend you have some great love story that survived through all your  perceived struggles,Mentalcomposer
and your solution to this is to set an arbitrary date at which point if he doesnt want to get married you will leave  i think my eyes are stuck in the back of my head from that hard roll,Mentalcomposer
you two both have a lot of growing up to do and i think it should be done separately,Mentalcomposer
you are a grown man why are you moaning to your parents about your job when you readily admit that you bore everyone about it theres only so much a person can take,Mentalcomposer
figure your shit out for everyones sake,Mentalcomposer
make up with your parents and get some help you sound insufferable,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i dont understand this at all,Mentalcomposer
godparents where i come from are not expected to raise or even help raise the child,Mentalcomposer
its a religious thing for baptism i never expected anything from my kids godparents,Mentalcomposer
she is saying she expects you to be all in with this kid from day one then no id decline thats mom and dads job of course everyone needs some help occasionally so then its grandparents siblings and friends very occasionally,Mentalcomposer
how does she treat the godparents of her first child are they bending over backwards for this child and does she talk badly about them if they dont,Mentalcomposer
id tell her you just dont feel you will have the time and energy to help raise her child and in addition you feel very strongly that you plan on focusing on your child when you have them and arent going to worry about anyone elses household,Mentalcomposer
shes a selfish person and as you know a selfish friend this decision might finally get you free of her,Mentalcomposer
think how much hurt youre setting yourself up for in the future,Mentalcomposer
people who love you do not tell you they dont love you talk shit to their family about you get an apt behind your back and seemingly try to get with their co worker,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt really want to be with you hes just too much of a coward to break up so he does everything he can do to try to get you to break up with him so hes not the bad guy,Mentalcomposer
give him what he wants,Mentalcomposer
exactly how will it keep you busy and away from him,Mentalcomposer
is he expecting you to go outside to his car and itll take you a while to pick the lock with a bobbie pin,Mentalcomposer
locking your stuff away is a sure fire way for you to keep engaging with him,Mentalcomposer
why exactly are you with him he seems to treat you crappy,Mentalcomposer
youre missing the barbells,Mentalcomposer
your practice mistakes and stories,Mentalcomposer
nothing about this makes sense,Mentalcomposer
they include you when youre single while some of them are attached but then start excluding you when you get attached,Mentalcomposer
if it was that their partners felt threatened cause youre the young chickie  no offense to you just how older sos would view it id think the partners would be glad you found your own man,Mentalcomposer
they tell you when they got a raise or new car is it possible they are a bit salty that you as the young newish one is making the same money as them and theyve been their longer it have more experience  obviously its not your problem but they have to take their angst out on someone,Mentalcomposer
you need to speak with the ones that you were friendly with and ask what the deal is thats the only way youre gonna figure out why the sudden cold shoulder,Mentalcomposer
your partner recounted to you the horrible things you said and you dont remember saying them,Mentalcomposer
think about what you said is there any truth to it at all even a little,Mentalcomposer
you broke up once are you sure you,Mentalcomposer
both agree those issues are resolved,Mentalcomposer
think back was anything you said related to that time,Mentalcomposer
all this to say take some time and be brutally honest about if he is really the one you want to be with,Mentalcomposer
maybe this whole thing is pointing to a reevaluation,Mentalcomposer
i always wondered if a meeting with both sets of parents and both kids and a school psychologist to mediate would be helpful,Mentalcomposer
get it all out in front of everyone why do you pick on or bully or throw things or whatever and no letting the bully not answer,Mentalcomposer
i think younger kids would probably stop the behavior but middle and high school is a toss up depending on what the parents of the bully are like,Mentalcomposer
trash parents make trash kids,Mentalcomposer
if that fails then yes my kid would be learning to fight  ill give you one chance but ill be dammed if my kid is gonna be fodder for some insecure bully,Mentalcomposer
esh you both sound unorganized,Mentalcomposer
i dont mean to sound judgmental at all my first didnt sleep thru the night until maybe 9 months so i understand what youre going thru but,Mentalcomposer
why is your home always a mess,Mentalcomposer
two adults and a 6 mo old who doesnt even crawl yet never mind play with toys,Mentalcomposer
your wife didnt need to put together the high chair right that minute and how long did it take seems like it was hours,Mentalcomposer
you could have made supper while the baby sat in a playpen or a baby chair or just take the initiative and order something,Mentalcomposer
first babies are hard for the fact that youre tired youre figuring out a new normal and a new schedule,Mentalcomposer
put the baby in a baby seat or a swing or a playpen or whatever you use and go about doing what you need to do if youre cleaning the lr have them in the room with you and just chat away at them while you clean if youre making bottles bring them in the kitchen and do the same they will be fine if they fuss a bit its what they do,Mentalcomposer
as far as the formula im not even sure what your wife was upset about she had to tend to a crying baby while you went downstairs to make a bottle  maybe her job should be to make sure there are enough pre made bottles made to last thru the night,Mentalcomposer
you can then clean and make them to last thru the day,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
they are your assets and can go to whoever you want id think dan would know why he wasnt included,Mentalcomposer
if your son is old enough and has had a good relationship with his uncle before he cut off contact maybe one of your other sibs can give him dans number and your son can text him,Mentalcomposer
but be warned you dont speak to your dad your brother has turned against you do you really want your son conversing with someone who is going to talk bad about you  you dont know what dan is going to say or if your son is going to decide youre the bad guy   be careful what you wish for,Mentalcomposer
this is the only answer,Mentalcomposer
people cannot be won in a fight,Mentalcomposer
if they dont want you accept it and move on,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
this person has accused you of despicable things and then went  oops sorry didnt mean to totally screw with your life  cause really im sure the whole school heard the accusation lets be friends again,Mentalcomposer
how does this person even have any friends left after what they did,Mentalcomposer
nope how could you ever trust this person ever again,Mentalcomposer
id stay as far away from this person as possible,Mentalcomposer
as long as you find a dress that you absolutely love within your moms budget  and i am sure you can i would just tell mil that while you appreciate her offer you really want your mom to be the one to buy your dress its a mother daughter thing and that doesnt take away any good strong feelings toward her and you appreciate all the help she has offered for the wedding,Mentalcomposer
she should be able to understand that md bond and respect it,Mentalcomposer
also can i give 2 pieces of advice,Mentalcomposer
plan your wedding for what you and fianc want his mom might want top tier everything or every option on the menu but figure out if these are things that you really want sometimes less really is more,Mentalcomposer
go dress shopping with just your mom you will know which dress is yours its a feeling when you see yourself in it your dress shouldnt be decided by a committee too many opinions will cloud your judgement  ive watched too much say yes to the dress but i honestly believe this,Mentalcomposer
congratulations and dont stress about planning this should be a happy fun time,Mentalcomposer
how long have you been dating,Mentalcomposer
have you guys even talked about what the future would look like once the baby is here were you planning on being a couple,Mentalcomposer
look i think its unreasonable that shed choose to spend tgiving with another guy is it just the two of them or is she going to his familys holiday since i would think you two were in a committed relationship but idk her situation are you working that day does she not have family close or friends she could spend it with  did you two even talk about what you were doing for that holiday,Mentalcomposer
her idea that two guys cant hang out alone is off the wall to begin with i dont even know how shed go right to must be gay,Mentalcomposer
you need to make some decisions,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be with her,Mentalcomposer
do you just want to coparent and not be a couple,Mentalcomposer
take today to decide and then contact her to tell her what you decided youre old enough to make these decisions about whats best for you,Mentalcomposer
either way id def get a paternity test and have everything go thru the courts especially since youre military and could be moved at any time protect yourself and your rights to your child,Mentalcomposer
talk about division of chores but realize that at times things wont get done its ok if some chores like dusting or vacuuming dont get done on sat every single week itll keep,Mentalcomposer
just be flexible with almost everything youll eventually find a rhythm that will work for you both,Mentalcomposer
i think theres more to this,Mentalcomposer
what did your friend mean about making better decisions about you the pregnancy the family friend,Mentalcomposer
what would make her jump to you are gay  unless your friend texted more than what you know,Mentalcomposer
really just let her go dont even try to contact her,Mentalcomposer
if you think its your child go thru the courts for paternity testing visitation and support dont even try to work this out with her youll be in for months of crazy,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
for all the reasons everyone else posted but also because as you stated youre not even sure if your d is telling the truth,Mentalcomposer
not yours or your d place to say anything,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
him having no one to hang out with isnt your problem,Mentalcomposer
he moved to a place he knew no one thats what happens,Mentalcomposer
you broke up when you were a junior in college youve moved on and its time he did too,Mentalcomposer
but you have to tell him or hell keep trying to force his way into your life,Mentalcomposer
its not odd that he moved to your city but did he have a job lined up other friends or at least a reason other than he likes it,Mentalcomposer
hes free to live wherever he wants but it does seem like he moved to be closer to you and thats creepy,Mentalcomposer
heres the thing  you do not have to be friends or even talk to anyone you dont want to,Mentalcomposer
so if you dont want to talk to or be friends with the ex just tell him dont explain why this isnt a conversation this is you stating call him or text him  it make it short i dont want to talk to you anymore we are not friends goodbye then hang up and block him if you called,Mentalcomposer
do you just let that talk to you that way or so you answer them back,Mentalcomposer
say it firmly and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they say anything else about your food you will not be back,Mentalcomposer
i realize theyre your parents but at this point it should be more of a reciprocal adult relationship not a parent child one they should treat you accordingly,Mentalcomposer
the thing is you can never be absolutely certain that a partner is not going to cheat,Mentalcomposer
its only been 3 weeks the hurt over his cheating is in the forefront of your every thought your fear will be brought into any new relationship you have,Mentalcomposer
maybe you shouldnt be looking to date and give yourself time to just be,Mentalcomposer
eventually you will find someone who you want to be with and the fear you have now will be lessened to the point that you wont be in paranoid mode,Mentalcomposer
paranoid mode which is not at all healthy will only lead to you questioning everything your partner says everything they do and it will drive them away nobody wants to be looked at with constant suspicion for just living their life,Mentalcomposer
dont let this fear take over your life this too will pass,Mentalcomposer
sorry no,Mentalcomposer
no one needs to placate their partner to the detriment of their own well being,Mentalcomposer
your wife is insane,Mentalcomposer
divorce over an over cooked chicken sandwich  i cant even,Mentalcomposer
is she frequently this absurd have there been other issues that she goes insane over if you dont cave in to,Mentalcomposer
for me id just agree to the divorce to save myself from the crazy,Mentalcomposer
i am curious tho did she eat her whole sandwich how about the sister,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
you certainly have a very high opinion of your family dont you most times when i meet someone like you i cant quite figure out why,Mentalcomposer
the fastest way to keep them together is to make them be apart,Mentalcomposer
and really you are a grown woman and you really are entertaining the thought that your 16 yo is going to be with this guy for the long term,Mentalcomposer
we all thought that at 16 and it never does  for the majority anyway,Mentalcomposer
leave them alone your d will decide if and when shes had enough,Mentalcomposer
why doesnt he want your dads money  is there any bad blood there,Mentalcomposer
how does your dad treat your h older kids,Mentalcomposer
have you told your h that its almost insulting that he wont allow you to help shes as much your d  as his at this point,Mentalcomposer
and if its a trust then its your money not your dads no,Mentalcomposer
you can also go along with leah taking out the loans  she wont have to even start paying them back till 6 mo after she graduates at that time maybe your h will soften his stance and you can pay off the loans,Mentalcomposer
i thought i heard read that your phone does listen to what you talk about but if you turn siri off it cant,Mentalcomposer
anybody know if its true,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot of anxiousness when they leave the house in the beginning,Mentalcomposer
a lot of texts saying they arrived wherever,Mentalcomposer
then after a bit it becomes commonplace,Mentalcomposer
and youre actually glad you dont have to stay up late to pick them up from wherever they went,Mentalcomposer
go on the trip,Mentalcomposer
memories with your friends will last a lifetime,Mentalcomposer
you cannot know what the future holds you or your gf will get to uni and the distance and freedom may cause one of you to want to explore what else is out there,Mentalcomposer
why will it take him time to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
does he not read newspapers or magazines,Mentalcomposer
does he not have friends who know whats going on with them,Mentalcomposer
hell if hes so close youd think hed try to keep up with whats being put out there,Mentalcomposer
i just cant figure out what the end game was supposed to be with this display,Mentalcomposer
the connection to diana can only go so far he may have a soft spot for harry but she has been instrumental in harrys misery,Mentalcomposer
elton should sing about that,Mentalcomposer
im pretty sure this is illegal,Mentalcomposer
why would you even want to be married to someone under these circumstances  you will be putting your relationship life on hold for the foreseeable future are you really willing to not have a real relationship with someone you love,Mentalcomposer
it does not benefit your life in any way,Mentalcomposer
i say just tell her youre not comfortable with this and the answer is no,Mentalcomposer
nope  theres nothing to discuss,Mentalcomposer
in my book this is a no coming back from break up thing,Mentalcomposer
brooke sivendra royals series and the james thomas series is awesome,Mentalcomposer
anything by megan march,Mentalcomposer
christin  harber has a delta series thats pretty good,Mentalcomposer
i could be wrong but even up until the baby shower i think the perception of h and by extension m was that they were all about championing causes,Mentalcomposer
i could see the clooneys being somewhat in that circle they have a justice foundation and have a charity geared toward sudan,Mentalcomposer
now why amal was invited was probably more to do with m wanting to appear to be friends and cash in on that status but i would think amal would be a little more busy to attend,Mentalcomposer
once they realized that these two were more interested in what can be done for themselves they knew they didnt want to be involved with them,Mentalcomposer
more a case of they came they saw and ditched them,Mentalcomposer
thank you for the duomo tips,Mentalcomposer
why do you have a problem with him hanging out with his friend,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused why he needs to be home when you get home,Mentalcomposer
its his day off he can enjoy it without you  just like you can do what you want on your day off,Mentalcomposer
you dont need to be attached at the hip,Mentalcomposer
wait your bf was cheating on his ex for 6 months with you,Mentalcomposer
thats why you dont trust him to be out of your site,Mentalcomposer
i agree she did something related to the embassy that her uncle had a hand in arranging,Mentalcomposer
but bower says her dad paid for the  study programme and her sister says she wasnt employed by the embassy but was at a school attached to the embassy that arranged work study,Mentalcomposer
so really which is it,Mentalcomposer
did her dad pay for a program but what kind of program is only 56 weeks or did he fund her living arrangements,Mentalcomposer
is the sister embellishing her recollection to make mm look even more like a fool,Mentalcomposer
that being said i certainly believe whatever she was doing there had nothing to do with any diplomatic relations whatsoever so basically just another lie to try and make herself seem more important which of course backfired,Mentalcomposer
im not really seeing what it is that you need to work on,Mentalcomposer
you got a little lazy once you moved in and played games for longer than she would like   ok it happens she points it out and you adjust,Mentalcomposer
porn once and you have to tell your gf about it this is just silly if the urge strikes and you need a little help finishing why cant you do that does she have to control every orgasm you have  i dont even watch but have no issue with it,Mentalcomposer
so shes stressed if she cant handle a relationship and regular life stress at the same time it kinda seems like she needs to do some work not you,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if shes as good a friend as you say then she would presumably already know your financial situation and she wouldnt be hurt by you not coming,Mentalcomposer
she may be disappointed that you cant be there but she shouldnt have any bad feelings toward you,Mentalcomposer
you need to get her on the phone and explain exactly what you told us here that you are upset you cant be there but its your last month of school and you just dont have the money to fly home in jan and then in feb when you have to leave the school,Mentalcomposer
ask if when you are home in feb can you celebrate her marriage see all the pics and get all the details of the day,Mentalcomposer
i hope shes understanding of your situation,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and hes cheated already,Mentalcomposer
its like he didnt even try to be faithful,Mentalcomposer
is that what you want to have in the back of your mind all the time,Mentalcomposer
you guys were friends before maybe you should go back to that before you get in too deep,Mentalcomposer
and of course dont snoop if your gut is telling you something is off trust it and confront him,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter what bil thought he was doing he was way out of line,Mentalcomposer
did no one say anything to him at the time your sis your parents  not even your husband,Mentalcomposer
what exactly would you be apologizing for not sending him his own gold plated invite  ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
and wedding invites are always addressed to the couple not each individual,Mentalcomposer
your sis and her husband can go pound sand do you even really want them there,Mentalcomposer
his reaction was way way over the top does he do that a lot,Mentalcomposer
please dont change anything on yourself because he doesnt like it,Mentalcomposer
today its eyebrows whats tomorrow going to be  weight boobs clothes,Mentalcomposer
youll get to a point where you wont even recognize yourself,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i would think your parents would want you to go to the competition because of all the hard work youve put into it,Mentalcomposer
your sisters graduation is important but its important to her and your parents mostly,Mentalcomposer
not that you arent happy and proud for her but its not like graduation will be ruined if youre not there,Mentalcomposer
send your sis a text explaining how much this competition means to you and that its not that youre not thrilled for her but this is a one time thing for you,Mentalcomposer
signed,Mentalcomposer
the sister who didnt go to her older sisters graduation,Mentalcomposer
it also depends on your age and life circumstances,Mentalcomposer
if you live at home and are a student and its just for spending money then sure why not,Mentalcomposer
if you are supporting yourself then you have to figure out how much of that salary you actually take home and decide if its enough to live on,Mentalcomposer
since you say its a bit above min wage then maybe its not the worst job to take even if its just to get some experience or if youre in a spot where you need a job any job,Mentalcomposer
maybe one of these,Mentalcomposer
this is an argument i would have,Mentalcomposer
hes known this for 2 months and being that you scheduled this so far in advance ill assume you had to give that much notice and cant just willy nilly change your days,Mentalcomposer
im getting the feeling that you placate him more often than not and he feels entitled to dictate what he wants,Mentalcomposer
but did you tell him you were taking those days and then he decided to schedule all this private stuff,Mentalcomposer
thats the key here,Mentalcomposer
if he knew you were taking those days then hes wrong for scheduling on those same days i would tell him too bad he has to reschedule as your days were already set,Mentalcomposer
and no way i would be leaving my home for his stuff he can lock himself in a room away from where youre going to be,Mentalcomposer
i didnt even know he was in baywatch,Mentalcomposer
so i went and looked him up,Mentalcomposer
hes slightly more attractive then than he is now but still does nothing for me,Mentalcomposer
sorry i know its just me,Mentalcomposer
but him now just always looks dirty like he needs a shower,Mentalcomposer
so then tell him you cannot be with someone who is so irresponsible with money and break up,Mentalcomposer
tell him to call you when he has figured it out,Mentalcomposer
jason mamoa,Mentalcomposer
def successful and fit but hes just ugly to me,Mentalcomposer
yeah you should tell her but i wouldnt make a big thing out of it,Mentalcomposer
since youre the same age she might assume  youre gonna graduate at the same time better to know now if shes ok with this  and i cannot imagine why she wouldnt be,Mentalcomposer
youre just dating so i would think there would be a lot of conversations and do wonder why this hasnt come up before,Mentalcomposer
i think we all figured he would announce  hes already come out to moan that arizona was  taken away from lake,Mentalcomposer
im more curious to see who in the near future is going to support him and what the rnc is going to say and do,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i find it incredibly weird that you collect nudes like why,Mentalcomposer
and then to trade them like one would trade baseball cards says to me that your attitude about the girls who post or sell nudes is that they are  lesser or maybe not be deserving of respect,Mentalcomposer
you think nothing if trading some other girls pics but god forbid you send your gfs pics anywhere shes better than that gmafb,Mentalcomposer
youre not a horny teenage boy who cant control himself and needs to troll the internet for exciting pictures to get you off  youre supposed to be more mature than that but we know thats not the case dont we,Mentalcomposer
take a long hard think about that,Mentalcomposer
the absolute fact is that if he wanted to be with you more than his gf he would have broken up with her as soon as he realized that,Mentalcomposer
he hasnt so he doesnt,Mentalcomposer
he talks a big game wants to respect your values and boundaries but always trying to push them so right there i dont trust anything he says,Mentalcomposer
do you think he wont do and say the things hes doing and saying to you if you guys are dating unlikely,Mentalcomposer
dont hang out solo with him make sure you have a trusted friend with you when you hang out with him who will stop you from doing anything stupid,Mentalcomposer
are you that hung up on him or is he just nice enough and is there at this moment,Mentalcomposer
theres nothing to figure out,Mentalcomposer
you only know this guy a few months how close friends can you be,Mentalcomposer
this guy is still with his gf just the idea that he would even make a move on you shows you his character,Mentalcomposer
do you really want to be with a guy who while he has a gf is telling you hes not sure he wants to be with her while also trying to get with you,Mentalcomposer
you really have no idea what is going on with his gf he can tell you anything he wants you have no idea how to verify it,Mentalcomposer
your idea is solid he breaks up with gf he takes some time to get over her while you two stay strictly platonic friends while you figure out if you want to be with him,Mentalcomposer
dont compromise your values for anyone if they cant wait they are not worthy,Mentalcomposer
have you two ever even met in real life,Mentalcomposer
ldr is just not for you,Mentalcomposer
its perfectly ok for you to tell him you cannot continue this relationship,Mentalcomposer
wish him well and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
then b has to tell c that they have no interest and to stop asking a to set it up,Mentalcomposer
i feel like youre missing a fundamental basis of marriage which is trust you married this person so id like to think it was because you love and trust him,Mentalcomposer
apparently not because you really stretched his innocent question about tinder for his friend to thinking hes going to cheat,Mentalcomposer
seriously i cant even do the mental gymnastics it would take to get to that conclusion,Mentalcomposer
if he was going to cheat im positive he would not be asking you which dating app to use,Mentalcomposer
calm down crappy ridiculous arguments like the one you had will eventually be the death of your marriage if you continue these silly arguments,Mentalcomposer
you your husband and your marriage will be much happier if you just trust in the fact that you married each other in good faith with the idea that its forever,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for the end before its even had a chance to start,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
in addition to being an absolute dirtbag and disgust me,Mentalcomposer
you obviously have no respect for your gf and only think of her in terms of what she can do for you,Mentalcomposer
i dont care how bad the construction industry is in your area you get another job any job you dont pimp out your gf,Mentalcomposer
i hope your friend tells and i hope she kicks you to the curb,Mentalcomposer
you dont deserve her,Mentalcomposer
keep that money,Mentalcomposer
it may seem trivial to you but when you were little i am sure you brought joy to that woman by just spending time with her and sharing your amusing stories,Mentalcomposer
and she showed you how much she appreciated your company by gifting you in her will,Mentalcomposer
you have to do what is best for you,Mentalcomposer
and this is not what you want anymore,Mentalcomposer
why would you  put what he wants above what you want,Mentalcomposer
first thing find a new job its ridiculous that your job is threatened just because you work for his relative,Mentalcomposer
get that straightened out first then work on an apt in the meantime save as much money as you can,Mentalcomposer
as far as being heartbroken will you really be  youre in an admittedly not healthy relationship its quite possible that you will feel relief as opposed to heartbreak,Mentalcomposer
will you miss him or will you miss the routine that you have been in  those are two very diff things,Mentalcomposer
ultimately you will be fine just the fact that you recognize that you two are not compatible is huge i would think most people would just keep going along to get along,Mentalcomposer
you know what you have to do just get it started life is too short to be stuck with someone just because,Mentalcomposer
nta for not wanting to change your schedule,Mentalcomposer
but you really should have pointed out that you were hired for 25 travel and as of now it has been 100 travel,Mentalcomposer
if i was you i would call into the person that hired me and find out what the deal is,Mentalcomposer
if they want you to permanently work in the far place which it seems they do then you have to decide if this is a job you want to keep,Mentalcomposer
nta for being livid about him quitting before having a new job but,Mentalcomposer
youre having another baby who is going to take care of this baby,Mentalcomposer
for the first one he did and you went to work maybe hes thinking it would be the same way but of course he should be working up until the baby is born to have a bit of a money cushion,Mentalcomposer
and have you thought about how youre going to handle 2 kids on your own  you will still have day care needs and someone to watch the other child before and after school and what do you do if you get deployed again  can you count on him to stay in your area after you send him packing or is he gonna run home and then youre literally in your own,Mentalcomposer
you guys need to talk about all of this your job his job your budget child care,Mentalcomposer
dont just go scorched earth until you have had this conversation,Mentalcomposer
oh gosh didnt even realize that,Mentalcomposer
caught ever other typo i think except for the one that made a funny difference,Mentalcomposer
im not sure if this is sarcastic or not,Mentalcomposer
and idk about magical rights but there are provisions for parents to give medical decision authorization to another person for either a limited time period or until the parent can be contacted,Mentalcomposer
if i take my childs friend with us on vacation their parents gives me the authorization to approve medical care if something were to happen to them while on vacation or until the parent can be contacted,Mentalcomposer
service members do the same thing if they are going to deployed or otherwise out of contact,Mentalcomposer
single people may do it if they have no family and are having a risky surgery better to designate someone who knows your wishes than leave it to an anonymous medical team,Mentalcomposer
i think he has shown you enough of what he is really like im not convinced his drinking was to numb the pain of hurting anyone that would mean he actually had any empathy which he seems to be lacking toward you,Mentalcomposer
he was the one who blew up his life and family  and i wonder why he did that since that was left out you just happened to be there so he wasnt alone,Mentalcomposer
anyone who would treat you bad while your father is right there helping you move out is absolutely not the person i would ever give another chance to,Mentalcomposer
hes obviously some years older than you let him go there are more stable less baggage guys closer to your age that you can build a solid life with why are you even trying with this one,Mentalcomposer
this is a def case of parents know best,Mentalcomposer
nta but your friend sure is,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt have to give you guardianship but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if when she cannot be contacted,Mentalcomposer
id probably get it notarized while im at it,Mentalcomposer
so theres that now as far as holding her hostage  oh no shes got that backwards,Mentalcomposer
lets look at this  her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant then they say yeah come back into the fold but without the baby,Mentalcomposer
so your friend is just having it all isnt she  she gets to dump  yes i say dump because thats exactly what shes doing the baby on you whenever she feels like going home,Mentalcomposer
and then when shes good and ready to come back she resumes care of her child,Mentalcomposer
you are a saint for agreeing to any of this,Mentalcomposer
she needs to decide is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react or is she going to pretend he doesnt exist to make her parents happy,Mentalcomposer
this baby isnt going to disappear you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents dont accept him now what makes you think that will ever change,Mentalcomposer
are you ok with that,Mentalcomposer
honestly you guys were young when you got together its possible this has just run its course,Mentalcomposer
he might realize he misses you or he might enjoy being free of commitment and enjoy being single for the first time in his adult life,Mentalcomposer
i suggest you also enjoy being single and free,Mentalcomposer
hang out with friends find ways to be ok with being single,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt be of a mindset that this is the only guy for you most of us have felt that way but its rarely true,Mentalcomposer
spend less than you make cut out any expenses you dont absolutely need and invest the leftover,Mentalcomposer
put it in a mutual fund not individual stocks,Mentalcomposer
it may seem like such a small amount to invest but give it time once you start to see even a small increase in value it will spur you to keep at it,Mentalcomposer
once you are comfortable with the amount you can put away each month have that amount auto deposited each month from your paycheck and you wont even miss it,Mentalcomposer
it may be a slow journey but it will be worth it,Mentalcomposer
girl seriously you are a fool,Mentalcomposer
love is blind maybe but deaf dumb and stupid  no,Mentalcomposer
you moved to be with an absolute loser who cant support himself never mind helping to support a kid,Mentalcomposer
what is it about him that you cant see he is using you,Mentalcomposer
i give him credit for being there for the child if hes the only dad the child ever knew but at the same time hes not really is he,Mentalcomposer
youre the one supporting him and the child,Mentalcomposer
the exs finances have absolutely nothing to do with anything these two will figure out what they need to do about the child without any help from you stop being their atm and if they dont thats their problem,Mentalcomposer
have you ever figured out how much he is really contributing to the household you two share,Mentalcomposer
wake up and get out,Mentalcomposer
heres an article showing their mortgage payment,Mentalcomposer
according to this their mortgage is 95 million with a monthly payment of 40000,Mentalcomposer
youre still in school so there is nothing wrong with living home,Mentalcomposer
why cant she come over and hang out in your room or you can go to hers,Mentalcomposer
you can watch movies and cuddle,Mentalcomposer
no need to always be going out somewhere,Mentalcomposer
im sure she is well aware of why you live at home and why you dont have unlimited money and she still wants to hang out so dont stress so much,Mentalcomposer
could be 2 reasons,Mentalcomposer
someone on govt assistance might be easier to take advantage of since donors are paid,Mentalcomposer
or,Mentalcomposer
the payments to a donor may make them ineligible to continue on assistance,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and even though you talk a lot its hard to really get to know a person that way,Mentalcomposer
dont you feel that there are just some things that dont translate well over the phone  how does a person act in social settings how do they talk to their family friends and even their child are they messy or neat do they have any odd quirks that def would not mesh with your life,Mentalcomposer
and more importantly will they and their child or you and your child get along with both other people  its not enough that you like her kid so far but what if she resents moving and leaving everything she knows and comes to resent you or your son what if your son resents having strangers move in,Mentalcomposer
my advice keep doing what youre doing for a few more months then bring your son to meet them then talk to your son and have an honest conversation with him and she should have one with her kid how do they feel  if theyre ok so far have them come to you and have the same convo again,Mentalcomposer
im guessing both kids are relatively young so it is either going to be easier cause they arent as aware or harder cause to the kids you and her are their while world and they wont take well with sharing their parent,Mentalcomposer
just some things to think about but please please do not upheave either child unless everyone especially the kids are ok with it put your kids feelings before your own,Mentalcomposer
did you really not realize that marrying someone after 2 weeks wasnt going to work,Mentalcomposer
seriously if you dont mind answering,Mentalcomposer
id love to know what was going thru your head at the time as it seems a lot of military have these quick marriages,Mentalcomposer
did no one try to talk you out if it,Mentalcomposer
so its ok that your d is getting sloppy two hundred seconds because he can take care of her and give you grand babies you realize a 35 yo man who is still able to attract a 19 yo has been around the block more times than you could probably count,Mentalcomposer
but your oh so precious s is so special that he cant saddle himself with a woman who may have had previous lovers what if she can provvide for him  you do realize she can still have babies dont you,Mentalcomposer
hypocritical much,Mentalcomposer
i found this,Mentalcomposer
its a free text crisis service,Mentalcomposer
they are trained professionals,Mentalcomposer
maybe try them check them out,Mentalcomposer
go to someone at your school guidance counselor teacher there is usually someone in every school who is there for the students,Mentalcomposer
if that fails walk into a hospital and tell them you need to talk to a mental health worker,Mentalcomposer
best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
i dont know about your scenario but if a parent was willing to do that why dont they just add your car onto their policy and you pay whatever the increase would be to your parents when the bill comes in it might be cheaper that way,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but maybe she has some weird aversion to doing the dishes like everyone has their one household thing that they hate doing,Mentalcomposer
ask her then you can swap out a different chore that she can do instead of the dishes you do dishes and she does one that you currently do,Mentalcomposer
i do wonder tho why you even while working full time were doing all of the household chores while she was working part time,Mentalcomposer
have  you guys talked about the changes that were going to take place since youve been sick does she feel that since shes working full time she doesnt have to do anything else you know like you were doing for however long,Mentalcomposer
seems like this marriage has been unequal from the get go,Mentalcomposer
im sorry you got so sick i hope you get well enough to go back to your job it must feel awful especially being in the health fuel that the thing that was supposed to help protect you actually harmed you,Mentalcomposer
nta for trying,Mentalcomposer
your bro seems to resent your mom because of the divorce he needs to know if he doesnt already that it was your dad who forced the divorce your mom was not willing to just forgive and forget the affair so him being mad at mom is not sensible make sure there isnt more to it than that,Mentalcomposer
now if youre still gonna talk to mom you need to let her know that bro is not a baby and hes also not a very affectionate person its nothing personal to her its just the way he is  even if it is just toward her,Mentalcomposer
hes a teen boy the last thing he wants is to hug his mommy if she needs affection that badly she should find a boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
i do agree they both that they both need therapy,Mentalcomposer
what could employees of a sandwich shop possibly divulge  mayo or mustard,Mentalcomposer
i could see it not wanting to be known where they honeymooned but thats a 2 week nda at most,Mentalcomposer
these two are so over the top its absurd,Mentalcomposer
im not sure you were being selfish,Mentalcomposer
you thought of her and what she was feeling and what would be better for her instead of clinging to her because you need her as you go through a really serious time in your life,Mentalcomposer
are you sure you broke up with her because you want to be with someone who is all in for you  that would be selfish or did you do it because somewhere in your mind you know that its unfair to ask her to be your nurse maid support person and girlfriend yet again  that would be selfless,Mentalcomposer
it might seem like you made the decision for her but she probably would not have made this decision on her own how do you leave the person you love when they are literally fighting for their life the guilt would be astounding,Mentalcomposer
i wish you a full recovery and a wonderful life,Mentalcomposer
its not hate its disappointment in you and the friend,Mentalcomposer
you have been in a committed relationship for 2 years with a guy who obviously trusts you  and his friend and both of you broke that trust and for what a couple minutes of funtime,Mentalcomposer
whats best for your baby is that it is recognized by its real father so that it can grow up knowing where they came from whether that father wants to be a part of their life or not,Mentalcomposer
you cant decide paternity based on who is in a better position to raise the child or who you would rather be with,Mentalcomposer
there are multiple stories on reddit where kids found out who there real dad was later in life and their whole world was blown up do you think thats good for your child,Mentalcomposer
you know your bf best how do you think hes going to react when he finds out the whole story  maybe he wont care and will stay and raise the child with you maybe hell break up with you but either way he needs to know,Mentalcomposer
saying nothing is not the solution,Mentalcomposer
secrets will come out at some point,Mentalcomposer
there is no other advice to give you have to be an adult and fess up,Mentalcomposer
he should be able to decide if he wants to stay with a gf who cheated and also whether he wants to stay friends with the guy who would sleep with his gf,Mentalcomposer
and really his friend on a trip where the bf was there  how did that even happen where was bf when you were sleeping with his friend 3 times,Mentalcomposer
i hope its the friends baby and the bf breaks up with you and dumps his friend,Mentalcomposer
you and the friend deserve each other,Mentalcomposer
but how did she react when you pointed out you thought you werent doing gifts since she got you nothing,Mentalcomposer
its very telling if she expects you to be giving to her and she has no obligation to reciprocate,Mentalcomposer
if she is mad then thats her problem not yours shell get over it,Mentalcomposer
but have the holiday gift talk soon save yourself any future grief,Mentalcomposer
usually id say its pretty standard to get and give your so a bday gift,Mentalcomposer
but you two are young do you guys even have disposable income to be able to afford gifts,Mentalcomposer
being that your bday is before hers there should have been a simple conversation about gifts either a price limit or an agreement to not exchange at all,Mentalcomposer
heres a thought instead of gifts agree to do something for both of your bdays supper and a movie an experience you both want to do etc,Mentalcomposer
this way youre both spending the same amount of money and nobody can get their feelings hurt over something pretty trivial,Mentalcomposer
you best have this conversation before the holidays come around,Mentalcomposer
i am curious did you say to her that she didnt get you anything so you just assumed you werent exchanging gifts this year  what was her reply,Mentalcomposer
are you saying that you and your partner are still willing to hang out with them but you just want her inappropriate behavior acknowledged,Mentalcomposer
so does that mean the rest of the friend group is not willing as in does not want to hang out with them at all,Mentalcomposer
if this is the case then it is eric and amy that have lost all their friends not just you and partner,Mentalcomposer
if you watch tv while on the couch you could get up and move during every commercial walk in place walk around the house use empty gallon milk jugs refilled with water and use as barbells its not much but it makes me feel like im doing something,Mentalcomposer
you can also buy one of those foot pedal things to do while you sit there,Mentalcomposer
youd have to be watching regular tv tho so if not set a timer and do it every 10 minutes for a minute,Mentalcomposer
were there any people dancing,Mentalcomposer
did the b  g even dance to italian rap maybe they like it if they were club people maybe they wanted it that way,Mentalcomposer
i agree it does sound awful tho even if i was a club person id want to dance to something i know,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
mistakes happen but you still paid for something that you didnt get,Mentalcomposer
youre in the group chat so you should have just answered his message to everyone that you didnt realize that you didnt actually order but still paid thinking you did order and just wanted to figure out why there wasnt one for you,Mentalcomposer
and everyone didnt need to know anything about what happened why would they,Mentalcomposer
im sure you talk to some other team members and would have mentioned to them what happened you know like normal people do and the committee could care less about uniform ordering im sure,Mentalcomposer
thats why i said to explain what went on with your bro so that your parents dont have a negative idea about you which is ridiculous anyway they raised you they know who you are and what youre like why would they ignore what they see and know just because their other kid says so,Mentalcomposer
look you are probably still in school so while its great that you are interested in learning computer stuff it cannot be the only thing you do besides school explain to your parents that all learning and studying is just as unhealthy as all gaming you need balance,Mentalcomposer
just tell your parents what really happened what he said you said and explain it to them clear the air so they stop thinking of you as the problem child,Mentalcomposer
you get 50 every time you help him cant you buy your own graphics card,Mentalcomposer
your partner is not there to make you happy fulfill all your hopes and dreams and jump at your every whim,Mentalcomposer
stop sweating the small stuff work out the big things,Mentalcomposer
small  its ok if your so didnt vacuum on tuesday like they said they would itll get done at some point,Mentalcomposer
big stayed out all night and you had no idea where they were,Mentalcomposer
treat each other like you want to be treated in return its a partnership not a competition of who is the better person,Mentalcomposer
after what he said about the dishes i wouldnt wash another one ever again fuck him,Mentalcomposer
know your place you know your place and it isnt with this ah,Mentalcomposer
stop this behavior  oh yeah im stopping everything with you,Mentalcomposer
you have a job and an apt ready to go take the leap whats the absolute worst that could happen,Mentalcomposer
you need to change your mindset from scared to mad mad enough that you just say fuck it and fuck him call today and make sure you can get that apt then when he leaves for work tomorrow pack your stuff and leave,Mentalcomposer
you can leave a note but dont explain anything just say im not coming back and dont contact me then block him and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
you can do this you did it before him and youll do it after him,Mentalcomposer
yes whatever this event is for its most likely nothing tw and her husband have done anything for  because,Mentalcomposer
they dont do anything,Mentalcomposer
so id ask what have you done for  insert event name,Mentalcomposer
and watch her try to word salad her way out of answering and then counter her answer and around and around we go until then just saying so basically you do nothing for anyone got it,Mentalcomposer
i agree its not any of the parents fault,Mentalcomposer
the kid is responsible for their actions and knows by this age right from wrong,Mentalcomposer
has the child acknowledged what they did wrong and what was the reasoning for it,Mentalcomposer
punishment should fit you took money so you earn it back to pay it back,Mentalcomposer
weekend chores around the house,Mentalcomposer
1200 is a lot of money what did they do with it,Mentalcomposer
lying is tough to punish because its more a trust issue  ie i cant trust what you say to be true idk what they lied about so these are example,Mentalcomposer
maybe once they are allowed back out with friends you make sure they can be tracked you confirm with other parents that who and where they are going is true,Mentalcomposer
if schoolwork is not being done then you arrange with the school to be informed of all assignments and you have them show you the work,Mentalcomposer
things of that nature until you can be relatively sure the lying has stopped or at least not for the big things cause the mundane stuff doesnt really matter in the scheme of things,Mentalcomposer
youve been advocating trying to help this child for a long time to no avail maybe now their parents will listen,Mentalcomposer
as the stepmom id be asking the kids dad what he was going to do about his wayward kid,Mentalcomposer
id also ask the dad to try and figure out why said child is doing these things you cant just blindly punish if you dont know whats going on with the kid,Mentalcomposer
oh and id also lock up anything of mine that has any value to it,Mentalcomposer
this,Mentalcomposer
i can sort if understand the idea that if harry comes she has to also as much as i think its ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
but lets look at them as a regular family there are some where ones spouse is not welcome to family things,Mentalcomposer
its no secret the rf has no good will left toward mm so while it may cause a bit of a stir that hed be going and not her shell be the one to save face and put out a statement saying she declined to go so at least one parent could spend archies bday with him or some other bull that makes her look not as left out,Mentalcomposer
ok thats odd then,Mentalcomposer
you need to ask him to explain what his aversion to meeting these people is,Mentalcomposer
how is he supposed to get to know them if he doesnt hang out with them,Mentalcomposer
his logic is flawed there must be another reason does he have any other friends except you  is he shy or have social anxiety  if this is the case maybe have him meet one person for a very short time and then another person until hes somewhat comfortable with hanging out with these people,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see you having is that this person it seems is withholding work related things from you because you dont agree with her opinion of mm,Mentalcomposer
if you outrank her then its time for a chat  she needs to know that regardless of her feelings about you based on your feelings of this topic the idea of withholding work related information is not acceptable and it needs to stop now,Mentalcomposer
you may want to wait to see if it happens again give her the benefit of the doubt but if it happens again then its time to take action,Mentalcomposer
it kind of sucks that shes giving you attitude and you might want to mention that too usually adults can be civil even if we disagree and this is such an insignificant thing for her to be so invested in,Mentalcomposer
but she really doesnt have to let him go does she,Mentalcomposer
he can just file and move out or share the house till its done,Mentalcomposer
its not like they both have to agree to a divorce,Mentalcomposer
now she may try to make his life a living hell try to smear him with whatever lies or truths she can get out there but after a while who is going to want to listen to her same old same old,Mentalcomposer
and maybe the rf will leak some of the more unsavory things they know about her to ruin her credibility even more,Mentalcomposer
yeah i wont read them in the hopes the dm will stop writing about these two,Mentalcomposer
i just come here to see whats new,Mentalcomposer
so thank you everyone,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that he doesnt even have a communication style,Mentalcomposer
whats with the ignoring you nope you need to say out loud that you will not stand by and be ignored,Mentalcomposer
you ask for a hug and kiss and he just moves you aside with no explanation at all  were you offended by this did you voice that to him and he did what said nothing  and then continued to ignore you hours and days later,Mentalcomposer
why are you still there  he clearly doesnt have any problem not talking to you so give him no one to talk to,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot more going on than a diff of communication styles,Mentalcomposer
we are one of the few that actually watched and liked suits,Mentalcomposer
that said even as we watched her character was the one we always said we didnt like she added nothing to the story lines we watched for the scheming of the rest of the shows characters,Mentalcomposer
i think we should all print this article and mail it to harry,Mentalcomposer
you know in case he missed reading it,Mentalcomposer
those are really cute,Mentalcomposer
do i think its a big deal that he played longer than an hour no not really i am not a gamer at all but i can understand the idea that sometimes you cannot just put a time limit on gaming things happen in a game teams are set up and you cant just drop out etc,Mentalcomposer
and your post made it seem as if he has been prioritizing you over his gaming for the past few months which to you is great but it probably really bothered him but he was trying to keep the peace with you that is not sustainable for any relationship with any hobby or outside interest,Mentalcomposer
i think you are more upset that his hobby is gaming if his hobby was long distance cycling would you be as upset that he goes on hours long rides every day probably not because youd see that as a good hobby as opposed to gaming which i suspect you see as a bad or childish hobby but thats not for you to decide for someone else,Mentalcomposer
and sorry but your family was quite frankly absolutely in the wrong adults dont admonish other adults for their likes and dislikes we accept that people are individuals and will like what they like if i was him i wouldnt want to stay involved with you knowing how your family was so dismissive and rude,Mentalcomposer
let him be to find someone who doesnt mind his hobby or who will actively participate with him in it,Mentalcomposer
youre not the one for him,Mentalcomposer
i thought the same thing,Mentalcomposer
he wants to get you a ps5 so that he can also play on it,Mentalcomposer
id let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for your birthday,Mentalcomposer
you can buy the ps 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other,Mentalcomposer
as far as i can see your bf will do something nice for you but then needs you to do something nice for him like tit  for tat and you will do that just to make him happy yikes,Mentalcomposer
this guy wouldnt do all the dishes just his  in his mind half who does that in what world does this seem like a normal thing to do and to boot you were sick,Mentalcomposer
and then he proceeded to only do his half of the chores  uh uh no way is this ok,Mentalcomposer
seriously i dont care how long you are together he sounds like a nightmare to be with,Mentalcomposer
ill bet he never does anything for you just for the sake of doing something to make you happy but you do that for him,Mentalcomposer
this is a seriously unbalanced relationship and youre on the losing side  ask yourself why you want to be with this guy what is he adding to your life,Mentalcomposer
theres a carnival ship that leaves port canaveral on sept 21  2023 ending in barcelona on oct 4,Mentalcomposer
then on oct 28 theres a trans back from rome to tampa  nov 12,Mentalcomposer
so you can have 24 days to bop around europe and then sail back to the us,Mentalcomposer
all diff airports  and i have no idea where youre starting from but it might be something to look about,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine she was fired because its not like she wrote the article in a vacuum,Mentalcomposer
someone higher up would have had to see the finished article and approve it for publication,Mentalcomposer
so if allyson gets put on unpaid leave the approvee would get worse,Mentalcomposer
anyone know if someone higher up at the cut is also gone,Mentalcomposer
do we think harry will even attempt to defend himself and expose what shes really like,Mentalcomposer
or is he gonna be just as spineless as he is now,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your bros relationship may not be an actual sugar baby one but are you afraid that maybe she likes him just a little bit more since he is comfortable,Mentalcomposer
im sure she likes him dont get me wrong but does she also have a career is she established in her own right,Mentalcomposer
maybe thats why youre bothered by the comments somewhere you feel shes not kidding,Mentalcomposer
i dont know if this is something you can come to as middle ground,Mentalcomposer
she has said what she needs is to be left alone to study you have to be able to do just that  leave her alone when she says she needs to study there is no middle ground there,Mentalcomposer
if your usual way of trying to be supportive is to constantly doing something for your partner then youre going to have to figure out how to not do something and reassure yourself that this is what she wants,Mentalcomposer
its going to be a long lot of years if you cant come to terms with this,Mentalcomposer
you might need to find something to do all the days shes busy youre a music major so do music  play learn a new instrument compose whatever it is that youre wanting to make as your career,Mentalcomposer
when you two are together just enjoy the time together whatever you do,Mentalcomposer
