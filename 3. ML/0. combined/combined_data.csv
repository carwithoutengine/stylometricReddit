tell your next closest friend shes the new invite op representative because clearly old friend cant handle it,MagicCarpet5846
obviously word it way more professionally than that but seriously tell them to stop letting him invite you because he isnt and you want to join them next time so ask someone else to take up the reigns,MagicCarpet5846
you literally just tell the girls hey i would love to join you guys next time looks like friend keeps not inviting me for some reason how about next time you all want me to join you invite me and ill be there,MagicCarpet5846
stop letting your friend be the gatekeeper of your invite you were clearly getting invited by someone else before have them take the lead back up unfortunately you learned this guy isnt your friend anymore but youre his boss you gotta be professional i would just distance yourself and make sure to keep being the cool boss to everyone else this reeks of i want to sabotage you and take your job,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you really just have to pick your girlfriend or your friends because if you dont break up with the girlfriend immediately after this none of these people will ever her over again and most likely will distance or drop you entirely,MagicCarpet5846
my point was if hes getting tested regularly it seems without a doubt he made sure she was tested early on and was negative,MagicCarpet5846
i never said you shouldnt but the reality is most dont so anyone who is subscribing to regular texting even in a relationship would be conscious enough to ask a partner about their std status early on and make sure they were tested recently,MagicCarpet5846
idk man if hes getting tested while in a relationship you would think hes the type to ask about stds beforehand,MagicCarpet5846
she sounds racist i know your type ill bet op is not white and the kids are potentially mixed and more white passing than she is,MagicCarpet5846
im assuming its racism not classism,MagicCarpet5846
maybe call the police and actual professionals rather than posting on reddit,MagicCarpet5846
it just makes it so you can fully focus on moving on you dont have a reminder in your life of what you lost or what could have been you wouldnt be constantly putting yourself through little moments of longing and sadness no contact is definitely meant for times like this because otherwise youre never going to be able to fully let the past be the past if it really isnt past,MagicCarpet5846
yeah shes going to totally fuck up her relationship with her kid by tracking her losing trust when she inevitably breaks the rules and potentially ends up in legal issues or needing to call the police,MagicCarpet5846
some damage cant be undone she shouldnt risk it because shes already playing with fire saying shell show up randomly at her daughters job especially because it sounds like this may be or turn into an abusive or otherwise toxic relationship not enabling it while preserving the relationship as much as possible is the smartest and most parental action to take,MagicCarpet5846
you likely need to simply take the car away from her in its entirety dont track your 22 year old daughter simply say its really clear youre not okay with following these rules and i dont want my trust in you to be damaged when you break them so you need to find a new way to get to work from now on because youve both lost access to the car im sorry but im not letting this situation escalate further,MagicCarpet5846
you can seriously damage your daughters trust in you  by tracking her and im sure it wont feel nice to be confronted with how far your daughter is willing to lie to you over a guy she just met dont make things worse make sure she can trust in you as much as possible should anything happen with this guy just dont enable her to be taken advantage of but be her mom not a police warden,MagicCarpet5846
would,MagicCarpet5846
she was a 362434 55 and 118 lbs at 19 which would probably make her a size 24 on todays standards at least when she was a teen i would imagine she filled out a little bit as she grew and ended up maybe a 68 which is still a perfectly healthy and beautiful size,MagicCarpet5846
you dont need a tourist visa for us or canada just a passport,MagicCarpet5846
i would be very honest with her that you cant stop her from going through with it but if she does that you cant promise it wont lead to divorce it sounds like shes scared as id make the argument you two were actively trying for kids if you werent using any actual birth control and actively were discussing kids i dont see this changing in a few years she can make the choice but she should do so understanding that it will end the marriage it does you both a disservice to pretend to be more supportive than you are itll make her feel blinded and could potentially influence her into a decision you are all unhappy with in the end you can make your feelings known so she can make an informed decision,MagicCarpet5846
wanting to murder someone is not normal just because youre 90 lbs and a teenager does not make anything youre saying okay get help i am not engaging in this anymore,MagicCarpet5846
you need help he will break up with you and if you dont speak to a therapist youll end up in jail because it wont be anyone manipulating him itll be him realizing hes dating a deeply unwell person,MagicCarpet5846
if hes joking why didnt he apologize,MagicCarpet5846
nothing youre feeling right now is normal please speak to a professional or at least a trusted adult about how youre feeling,MagicCarpet5846
and if youre wrong what if he breaks up with you what will you do to him,MagicCarpet5846
i wouldnt entertain that mindset most relationships at 17 dont last forever theres a very real prospect of you not being with him your life should continue beyond that,MagicCarpet5846
okay you definitely need some therapy because that attitude is deeply disturbing get some help youre only 17 so i get it but you wont be well if you keep entertaining such an exceptionally toxic mindset what will you do if he breaks up with you,MagicCarpet5846
that doesnt work the way you think it does in the real world youll end up dead if you have that attitude,MagicCarpet5846
wild that youd risk tax fraud for the same money either way,MagicCarpet5846
he cant work in japan with the proper visa if he plays theres no way it doesnt catch the attention of japanese officials and eg gets in trouble sure if he needed to do a business meeting for an hour with 5 people he might be able to get away with it but not an international televised event,MagicCarpet5846
it was more like we arent getting results worth the price we are paying so they dropped him cant really give a guy a demotion its either keep paying the salary or cut him and they clearly made the right call im sure if the org was totally flush with cash they wouldnt have made such a fast decision but multiple people in the org have also said the team wasnt doing well leading up to the decision either,MagicCarpet5846
because they are all teenagers who fail to understand that an expenditure report isnt just reporting pure salaries its reporting the cost to the company which will be at least 50100 more than the employee salaries and could be 34x depending on other overhead costs involved,MagicCarpet5846
i will also remind you that when running a company expenses tend to run 50100 of the salaries of your employees meaning you can likely half the expenditures if youre trying to figure out what portion of the total cost is on pure salaries the players see rather than the overhead involved in taxes benefits lawyers offices equipment etc,MagicCarpet5846
the number seems wrong because youre assuming that 100 of the cost of a team is player salaries and it typically isnt not from the perspective of the company theyll factor in at a minimum the taxes benefits and other comp package costs and theyll also need to have some additional overhead to keep everything running that will be summed in these expenditure reports,MagicCarpet5846
nta but youre going to need to tell them youre changing the password on x date before the change takes effect and theyll either need their own account or lose the service then as you dont want to run the risk of unknown numbers of households being charged to your account if anyone shares the password so no one but you will have it from now on,MagicCarpet5846
if youre inclined to say anything and only if youre an active part of the conversations i would just respond with its not that we suck youre just really good at hitting some insane shots im good for a casual player but those are some shots even the pros struggle to hit consistently,MagicCarpet5846
kill them with kindness reframe things as beginners luck and encourage them to keep it up more than them really sucking and you lying about your skills,MagicCarpet5846
best advice is telling anyone involved not to give you any information about his life you can always give the gf a heads up and say you dont have any proof so you just want to give her a heads up so she is cautious about any other red flags and then keep doing what youve been doing the sad thing is good doesnt always prevail sometimes evil wins the best we can do is try to combat it and not feed into it,MagicCarpet5846
if you have any articles or police reports or arrest records id probably anonymously send it to her and then let her make her own decisions,MagicCarpet5846
my guess is she found it funny or acceptable before but youve essentially described yourself as an asshole people like being around shes 18 i assume shes growing up and realizing she really doesnt want to be the person that loves hanging out with assholes and thats why shes putting some distance ill give you a heads up there are definitely people out there that find what you are describing totally normal and acceptable behavior but as you get older especially in modern society the number of people who do find that acceptable will rapidly dwindle if i were you id keep that in mind im not saying to completely shift your personality overnight but youre only 18 if you can try to be the person who grows up with their peers and doesnt get stuck in the assholes are cool phase of life,MagicCarpet5846
what are you on about not many employers would let you take off 3 days during busy season with a few weeks notice,MagicCarpet5846
in the case of you being weak then i really would not default to violence like this as youre essentially running the risk of if that hair pin doesnt make them back down you have no further defensive options and youve just royally pissed someone off youre putting yourself in significantly more danger this way be safe,MagicCarpet5846
i mean i think the sad reality is if you turn to violence any time a dude disrespects your boundaries youre going to find yourself in trouble or seriously hurt i would probably default to less violent means but taking selfdense classes and knowing how to properly defend yourself against a genuine attack rather than a standard creep is good,MagicCarpet5846
i understand how unfair it is but the reality is women are going to be subjected to an onslaught of creepy guys who will push boundaries and touch you without consent like that violence is sending a very clear message you arent okay with it and where high school boys are concerned yeah theyll probably be shocked someone is so forceful and leave you alone but other people might call the police against you and the reality is if theyre the one bleeding you might get a cop that sides with them even worse unless youre fully able to defend yourself you may make someone angry enough to seriously hurt you or teach you a lesson you said in a comment youre weak but fast so please be smart and safe about when to act in self defense,MagicCarpet5846
people can change dont act as though what someone said three years ago is what theyre beholden to for life,MagicCarpet5846
i mean why do you have an issue with him giving an ultimatum you two did discuss it and you responded by essentially saying well i can still meet someone i like more than you even if its a closed relationship so we might as well keep it open not exactly comforting,MagicCarpet5846
hes laying out his boundaries on what he needs to feel like a long distance relationship will work the discussion really is that simple i need xyz and you either say i can agree to that and you two continue dating or i cant agree to that and you break up it really sounds like what you want is a chance to convince him that an open relationship while living in portugal is fine otherwise whats the difference in how he opened up the second conversation hes being clear and expediting the discussion it can be really damaging to trust to try to convince someone why you still want an open relationship and he wants a closed one,MagicCarpet5846
at this point the ball is in your court if youre telling the truth that youre fine with closing the relationship then you should have no issue with his ultimatum because ultimately it isnt an ultimatum its just him communicating and establishing really clear boundaries which is the only way an open relationship has even lasted thus far,MagicCarpet5846
lowkey would expect her to just move to a major city which i mean thats probably what they should do,MagicCarpet5846
you should consult about the actual eviction process and start it that means giving notice in writing usually and being aware of next steps if they refuse itll be different since you live there as well and own so a lawyer specializing in landlord tenant disputes will help you out,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you just tell him i will not be getting pregnant until we have a baby name picked out if you really are this stubborn i will be going to get an implant in this week this is a hard boundary for me i am not going to endanger my life with a stressful pregnancy because youre too stubborn to compromise like an adult and i refuse to bring a child into the world with someone who thinks thats acceptable behavior,MagicCarpet5846
i think he thinks now that youre married youre not going to leave its normal and common for military to cheat on their spouses not everyone but obviously your husband is one of them you can choose to be a stereotype or refuse to partake but sounds like those are your only options,MagicCarpet5846
sean isnt on 100t im pretty sure hes on corrected to shopify rebellion as a content creator,MagicCarpet5846
i think you need to accept that not being okay with something isnt just grumbling about it and going along with what he says in the end its making a clear statement with actions behind it if i am only paying my share if that isnt okay with you we need to split because at the end of the day you are okay with it because youve stayed for four years of this love yourself more youre definitely being taken advantage of again,MagicCarpet5846
this isnt really a case of being wrong so much as you need to start respecting yourself is this really what you want in a life partner someone who is using you to subsidize their life despite making more than you i mean hes selfish at best and totally and plainly using you at worst,MagicCarpet5846
your friends were directly asked not to tell you your exs business you never asked your friends to keep info from your ex in the same manner it isnt really fair to say they chose her i also assume that since everyone of them knew they were dating these may have started out as your friends but along the duration of your marriage and you moving they became mutual friends to both of you,MagicCarpet5846
tell her she deserves to know shes being pursued by a cheater you owe him nothing and by telling her itll hopefully give him a reason to stay tf away from you,MagicCarpet5846
holy shit nta im not going to diagnose anyone but you probably should not remain in contact with a woman who has even less control over her own behavior than you she likely has her own unaddressed struggles but you need to look out for you and i cant imagine it would be easy to modulate your behavior well when someone is constantly forcing perfection or utter insanity upon your life,MagicCarpet5846
i would honestly think of it this way you would inevitably lose him anyway its better to lose him and gain a kind hearted man in your boyfriend than lose your boyfriend only to become bitter when your dad inevitably abandons you in the future,MagicCarpet5846
i mean i think its her right to decide if she wants to share that information with you or not people saying their loyalty is to her and not you isnt really that fair as she directly asked them not to tell you whereas i dont think you did something similar the only person i think its fair to have an issue with is m28 as he was in a situation to tell you himself or to ask your ex to tell you,MagicCarpet5846
i personally would just say to m28 hey im not mad at you for dating ex but i gotta be honest that it makes me uncomfortable that you listened to me talk about my experiences knowing you were with my ex i just want to clear the air so we can move forward without it being awkward you can decide you want to ditch the whole friend group but that seems like its punishing you more than them id just chalk this up to what happens when you have a lot of mutual friends it isnt their place to share news that they were explicitly told not to share,MagicCarpet5846
well were you aware your husband was wearing that jersey or did you genuinely have no idea this was a jersey let alone a signed jersey until after he got upset with you,MagicCarpet5846
if you were aware beforehand ofc youre the ah your kid vomiting doesnt suddenly shut down all higher level thinking in your brain you cant possible argue it isnt your fault for not having the common sense of i need to get a towel because my husbands jersey isnt an appropriate vomit rag,MagicCarpet5846
nta fhv is highly transmissible and can cause tons of issues in kitties you have to know if either of your cats has it before moving in together and if only one does you two shouldnt move in together,MagicCarpet5846
im gunna take a guess and say youve made similar comments in the past because calling this a lie is a pretty strong word it seems pretty clear you dont trust him especially since you just said its fair he wants someone who trusts him and not that he has someone who trusts him if you dont trust him and he knows you dont trust him why wouldnt he call of the wedding,MagicCarpet5846
most likely women in his culture say similar things too and once theyre stuck in marriage kowtow to tradition idk where hes from but i have seen it in some other cultures so he pretended to be okay with everything youre saying because he figured it wouldnt matter when you were stuck in the marriage,MagicCarpet5846
now its up to you to decide was he right,MagicCarpet5846
its common yeah are the guys youre attracted to very different from you or something because i mean i can imagine this happening if youre going after the sort of guy who goes after different girls and this is just a we have very different types situation,MagicCarpet5846
probably would see what you can do to reduce your hours so that you can show her with action that youre serious about making a change the issue is you work too much so work less make a change give her quality time not fancy gifts or expensive dates she wants to go on hikes or weekend beach trips with you she wants to make dinner together and fall asleep together not get fancy jewelry or a giant bouquet of roses sure thats nice too but if you try to throw money at the problem rather than make actionable changes in your behavior shes gone for good,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you said hes an immigrant is this normal in his culture because it could also just be that this is what having a wife means to him and if thats the case run,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity why are you not asking your fianc to handle this youre taking care of 95 of wedding planning and youre the one that needs to move in to care for his grandma girl you gotta make sure this man is an actual adult and capable of taking control of his own life his own family and his own relationship and not just throwing everything on you because it he isnt mark my words your marriage will end you will not be able to withstand being the manager of both of your lives forever,MagicCarpet5846
being understaffed on a particular night doesnt mean anything about retaining staff someone who worked in a restaurant should know the difference it was a saturday night having 12 people call off sick could and often does make a restaurant understaffed says absolutely nothing about the ability of the restaurant to maintain staff,MagicCarpet5846
ah yes please mansplain how people who say i take home well over 6 figures somehow know less about their own salary than you because you happened to have worked in a restaurant even though im talking about a fine dining restaurant on the level of 1600 meals being normal on not just servers in general,MagicCarpet5846
but go off i guess you know more than people do about their own jobs guess what was also a restaurant manager some make over 6 figures its not unrealistic or even that uncommon in fine dining,MagicCarpet5846
sorry fam he isnt changing for you or your kid accept him as he is or decide you want something different changing someone isnt happening especially not after 5 months,MagicCarpet5846
you may understand tipping but you dont understand math if you are making 100hour you need to work less than 20 hours a week to make 6 figures shes making well over 100 an hour because this is just one table and if you dont believe me google it the articles are out there it is 100 realistic and common in fine dining waitresswaiter makes 6 figures a year hundreds of threads and articles and amas pop up immediately,MagicCarpet5846
dang fam you got rejected by the person you let walk all over you and begged for more i would take this as a wake up call that youre really struggling with your self esteem and having any amount of selfrespect for yourself,MagicCarpet5846
if i were you i would be asking myself why on earth i still want this to be salvaged because i mean shes never been loyal to you never never wanted to never will and is now isnt even getting enough from this to want to stay it sucks but wake up man you deserve better,MagicCarpet5846
you cant be that dense shes making at least 100hour on one table and no server at a high end restaurant handled one table at a time waitresses do not care if their money comes from the job itself or customers and there is no way theyre complaining about the pay because frankly theyre highly overcompensated here,MagicCarpet5846
servers at even slightly fancy restaurants let alone one of this level routinely say the real reason they dont want tipping culture to change is because they make 6 figures and know damn well the job isnt a job worth 6 figures and if it were changed to a salaried position paid for by the employer theyd be making 2025hour flat rate instead of potentially hundreds of dollars an hour,MagicCarpet5846
nta its insane anyone would think a waitress should be making well over 150hour and if theyre serving a normal number of tables the real figure would be at least double that yeah they should get a livable wage it isnt a job worth more than engineers lawyers and even some doctors are paid sorry but the expectations of someone without any qualifications being entitled to that kind of salary is utterly insane to me,MagicCarpet5846
waitresses dont need to be making 100 dollars an hour for shitty service and thats assuming that was her only table which it obviously wasnt if them being busy and understaffed was the underlying reason for poor service,MagicCarpet5846
sorry but a waitress even at the highest end of restaurants and the best of service should not be making more than most lawyers engineers and even some doctors make,MagicCarpet5846
we dont know if sil made the rule or if family did we at least know sil isnt putting a stop to it though,MagicCarpet5846
reaffirming this isnt how men are this is how shitty unhappy people are,MagicCarpet5846
how to address it be honest i have a feeling youre planning on proposing soon and before we discuss marriage we need to have a serious conversation i am and have been unhappy and have not felt like my needs are being met for awhile now ive tried to delicately bring it up to you and it ended really tensely so i dropped it but i cant marry someone i dont feel loves me and isnt putting in effort in maintaining the spark i know weve been together awhile and its easy to get comfortable but i want more for my life than that i hope you do too i would love to go to a couples therapist if youre open to it so we can try to talk and find ways to reconnect but this isnt a dynamic i will be happy in forever and i want our marriage to last forever,MagicCarpet5846
were you tested for hiv because i looked up all of those drugs and they seem to be commonly used in treating secondary infections associated with hiv i would likely have your partner get a full and i mean full std panel and have him show you the results assuming he is fully clean then you can decide if you think your unhappiness is truly just a state of mind or not i cant tell you to choose happiness but i will remind you your daughters are learning from the example you set so act accordingly to what youd want them to do in the same situation,MagicCarpet5846
zitrolin appears to be azithromycin most commonly used to treat chlamydia and gonorrhea flucoral appears to be fluconazole and most commonly used to treat yeast infections or secondary infections with hiv herclov seems to be used for genital herpes in immunocompromised patients with hiv,MagicCarpet5846
given the fact that two of these are given to treat secondary infections due to hiv and one is a general wide spectrum antibiotic your partner having a history of shady behavior at best and they all treat different genital infections your partner very well may have and is hiding hiv from you or had an unsafe exposure and went to the doctor to get treatment for a number of sexually transmitted pathogens this is all information ive gathered from looking up the drugs and isnt medical advice but you need to be very concerned because i do not imagine this combination of drugs being given just because of an old herpes flare up im not familiar with how drugs are prescribed in the regions it says these drugs are available though,MagicCarpet5846
you didnt ask him if he was clean and when he was last tested before sleeping with him lady no offense but youre way too old to be so dumb and fast and loose with your own health at this point you need to decide if youre happy in this relationship exactly as it is or if you arent if you arent i would recognize you are a 44 year old woman and old enough to be able to stand up for yourself and say im not happy its better for us to go our separate ways and stop teaching your daughters that this is the relationship that they should aim for,MagicCarpet5846
lol oh my god i only lied to you once and i cant believe youre doing this you dont love me,MagicCarpet5846
youre damn fucking right i do not love someone who would so willingly endanger the lives of mothers and children on the road because youre too much of a fuck up to call an uber home the fact that completely sober he has no remorse and can say that to a nurse who very well may have real trauma surrounding the consequences of drunk driving shows that if anyone in this world is actually unloveable it might be him,MagicCarpet5846
i would honestly question the moral integrity of anyone who told me they actually did still love someone who pulled this sort of shit,MagicCarpet5846
nah i disagree rather strongly a girlfriend of 3 years absolutely gets to say if you want this relationship to continue you need to divorce your wife and i need to see proof,MagicCarpet5846
do you know how many women believed the whole bullshit of were separated well get a divorce eventually she doesnt even live around here to find him married with a baby on the way not saying thats the case here but the gf would and frankly is for letting it go on so long be an idiot for not wanting the divorce to be official by now and for wanting to know without a doubt that it is a real divorce i mean you need to give your partner some faith and trust but 3 years into a relationship and 5 years after a separation sorry theres trust and then theres being a fool she still shouldnt force herself to be at the courthouse but this is absolutely 100 her business this isnt a new relationship this is in the territory of trying to decide if i can or want to spend my life with this person territory and at that point yeah a major decision of hmmmm should i continue being a married man with a serious girlfriend becomes your business as said serious girlfriend,MagicCarpet5846
utterly ridiculous to claim it isnt her business or that its at all similar to her influencing his will,MagicCarpet5846
i really dont think its fair to say a gf of three years should have no say and should keep out of the fact that shes dating a legally married man she definitely is fully within her rights to wonder why after 5 years neither of them has finally said hey this marriage is obviously over lets make it official because even knowing and believing op that theres no feelings i am wondering how five years later and multiple state moves this hasnt been made official i mean shes had to get licenses and file for new jobs completely divorced is saying shes married it is definitely weird it would definitely get a side eye and some questions from any rational selfrespecting person,MagicCarpet5846
lets not make a completely valid concern of the girlfriend into an issue of insecurities because thats also harmful to women if i was dating someone separated and three years later they were still just separated omg everyone in my support system would be shaking me to snap out of it and leave,MagicCarpet5846
i would just say this is a legal process and the lawyers have advised me to only have us and a lawyer there to take care of things as amicably and quickly as possible i will see you immediately after and we can celebrate but im going to take their advice here to make sure this happens and happens quickly i am ready to close this chapter fully,MagicCarpet5846
could be how,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think youre breaking up for your son and you need to stop framing it that way youre breaking up because of you and knowing youre unhappy its also true that youre putting your son in the middle of a seemingly unhealthy relationship but you should not make your child bear the burden of ending your relationship own that decision yourself,MagicCarpet5846
nta but you need to handle this very delicately so i am glad youre excited and willing to support me in this journey and i am willing to pay up to 4kmonth for our home we can get a really nice place for 4kmonth and i would be willing to pay the entirety of the rent because im so happy to have you join me on this adventure but if you want a place thats more than 4k you need to be willing to pay the difference because i am not willing to spend any more than 4k if the place you want is 5k or 10kmonth i dont really care you need to pick a place where youre comfortable with paying that difference otherwise it feels like you want to spend all of the extra money im making and that would make this move totally pointless for me i want to save and i want to continue being responsible i need to know that you are i are on the same page here financially before we make this move because otherwise i honestly dont see the relationship working out long term if we are on such different wavelengths when it comes to finances,MagicCarpet5846
also not to be that guy but you can definitely get a nice place in a good part of town for 45kmonth in any city i lived in a good part of la for 3kmonth in a giant 1bd apartment with high ceilings and i lived overlooking the river in manhattan in a luxury small but extremely nice and plenty for a couple that isnt working from home apartment for 5kmonth and had a 2 bd apartment in the upper east side for 6kmonth again luxury building,MagicCarpet5846
yeah youre still living like a normal well off person you arent getting a mansion with 8 bathrooms but holy shit you dont need that especially if you her arent making enough to afford it and i specifically picked the prices for la and nyc because i know its two of the most expensive cities you can live in so absolutely bullshit you need an 810kmonth apartment for a couple with no kidspets where a 1 bed would be plenty and a 2 bd is excess if you want guests in order to live in a nice place without high crime your budget is plenty assuming you arent looking to live like a millionaire finding his trophy wifes lifestyle,MagicCarpet5846
she needs to learn to make choices she cant have everything,MagicCarpet5846
have you just say her down and said hey ive noticed this pattern and every time i try to talk to you about it you shut it down so the options are we either address it now or we need to break up because this isnt fair to me nor is the lack of communication an attractive trait to me,MagicCarpet5846
i think the issue is asking at all is going to damage your rep the same amount as trying to force her at this point if you no longer have any mutual in common no worries but otherwise i wouldnt,MagicCarpet5846
i mean that just mean another day of childcare instead sending the message after she had to leave of hey daughter is lovely but im not comfortable having a child in my home unsupervised for safety reasons and i cant guarantee ill be home all day while youre here so if youre unable to find childcare for daughter i dont mind you taking the day off with just a heads up thanks for understanding,MagicCarpet5846
thats probably the whole my toddler is still a toddler and isnt 100 perfect but we do try very hard to make sure they understand how to behave thing op was getting on yeah a baby is still going to be a baby sometimes but that doesnt mean good parenting and bad parenting wont produce on average wildly different behavior in children,MagicCarpet5846
youre not an ah but you do need to bite the bullet next time they ask just say im sorry but every time our toddler and their kids get together toddler gets sick we need to look after her health first so until all of them are older and have stronger immune systems ie better behaved or you have time to find a better reason we dont feel comfortable doing hang outs,MagicCarpet5846
you can also use olive oil followed up by her face wash to remove the oil then you can teach about skin care routines to promote natural beauty as thats a super diy two step cleanse the oils help gently break up the makeup and then the face wash removes the oils,MagicCarpet5846
i mean youre both being childish blowing up his phone is also the immature response because a mature and selfrespecting woman would simply say when youre ready to talk let me know so we can arrange to give each other back the stuff at our places and never tolerate this behavior from a boyfriend,MagicCarpet5846
this is not a friend is it because if he is genuinely just a friend you honestly need to back off youre coming off like a clingy gf,MagicCarpet5846
ok well if you genuinely believe that you are delusional because this was absolutely meant to be malicious and controlling,MagicCarpet5846
you need to snap out of whatever trance this dude has put you on before you end up a shell of yourself,MagicCarpet5846
nta just say her name wont be anything after your mom you can either sit here and figure out a name we both agree to or i will be taking your refusal as permission to unilaterally choose the name as i am her mother and carried her in my womb for 9 months you can pick whatever you want of those two options but those are your only two options compromise or get no say,MagicCarpet5846
i mean hes naturally a flirt he seems not to think of you as the special woman in his life but as though all women need to be blessed by his attention,MagicCarpet5846
ill say i have known people like this and yes they ended up all cheatingleaving for someone else that isnt a comment necessarily on your boyfriend but what ive seen from people who are flirty and everyone likes them,MagicCarpet5846
nta you asked what to do you do nothing remind him if you want to care for your brother i will get a job to support us and you can take care of baby and him thats your options i am unable and unwilling to take on that role and i have made that very clear it will go very poorly for you if you try to force this on me and will not end how you intend,MagicCarpet5846
it also reveals something about you your comments are coming off very obtuse at points you two are very obviously not on the same page yet you for some reason are unwilling to talk to him and get on the same page that sort of expectation will kill any marriage you do get around to so you may wanna up your ability to have difficult and awkward convos with your partner,MagicCarpet5846
give the cops a call,MagicCarpet5846
heads up your fiance is pretty willing to straight up lie to your face thats uh something you should look into before you marry her good intentioned or not thats not wife material right there,MagicCarpet5846
i mean did you actually ask him if he had any stds before having unprotected sex with him what he did is still likely illegal as usually hiv is a legally reportable disease to any sexual partners typically before any intercourse has occurred regardless of viral loading but also too many people assume a partner theyre exclusive with is automatically clean without asking the following,MagicCarpet5846
do you have any stds or stis,MagicCarpet5846
when was the last time you were tested,MagicCarpet5846
before i feel comfortable having unprotected sex i want us to both get retested and send each other the results are you okay with that,MagicCarpet5846
last one is optional but i have always done this it ensures that both of us were actually tested tested for everything not just chlamydia and gonorrhea and that no one is lying or asymptomatic or whatever and as an added bonus makes it really clear that if you ever do contract an std from them they without a doubt cheated and there is no well maybe it didnt show up yet crap,MagicCarpet5846
nah fam if he was able to remember you giving him a hall pass he was able to remember the three rules you gave him in the same conversation thats just a straight lie to try to blame it on the adhd,MagicCarpet5846
i dont even think a month has passed since hes left this sounds like it happened a few days ago,MagicCarpet5846
okay fam youre focusing on the wrong things here him wanting kids in the past is irrelevant he said he didnt want them now people change for a number of reasons if someone says i dont want kids you gotta focus on what theyre telling you not what you hope theyll want in the future and not what they wanted in the past you see how you messed up there,MagicCarpet5846
and unfortunately heres some more tough love if youre moving every 6 months to a new place every time i wouldnt picture yourself finding a long term relationship until youre able to settle down in one place guys are less likely than women to make a long distance thing work indefinitely that might also be playing a factor did this guy end things with you around when you had to move again is this info you tell the guys,MagicCarpet5846
he wanted kids with he because he was madly in love with her and not with you because he wasnt in love with you i get it hurts but youre not doing yourself any favors here,MagicCarpet5846
could be yeah might not be that either its impossible to know if he didnt tell you i dont think its worth your energy to figure out i think the big takeaway should be just because one particular individual was unable to love you does not mean you are unlovable in general and also dont date men who tell you they dont want kids,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846
see  for more info,MagicCarpet5846
i mean a spark in the beginning can fade quickly and a spark for you is not a spark for him guys can also seem really excited for you when really they just like a new experience it can also just die for random reasons its called ick you are super into someone and then they do something could be as innocuous as bad breath fighting with a waitress stopping wearing makeup or a million other things and all of a sudden the physical chemistry is just dead,MagicCarpet5846
but yes absolutely if you want kids and he doesnt that is enough for any man to immediately dip you need to be smart here and leave as soon as a man says he doesnt want kids because he isnt going to give you one and hell just dump you if you push it or happen to get pregnant kids are one of the biggest dealbreakers out there and can instantly kill a persons attraction to you,MagicCarpet5846
you will find a long term partner but it start by realizing dating is about finding someone youre compatible with and wasting time on someone you arent compatible with for instance someone who doesnt want kids or someone who isnt showing you any affectiontaking you on dates just means youre losing out on the possibility of finding the person you should actually end up with,MagicCarpet5846
ill give some tough love because youre 26 and its probably a lesson youd benefit from learning being wrong for a specific person does not necessarily mean there is something wrong with you in general yes i am sure there was a reason why he didnt fall in love with you maybe you did something that annoyed him maybe you have a different view on kids or retirement or whatever other fundamental goalbelief maybe you two just didnt have that spark physically whatever it is that is particular to him and your potential relationship with him not a comment on your worth as a person you kinda see the difference,MagicCarpet5846
i know that i am an utterly amazing catch but i also know that i am wrong for a heck of a lot of people out there and they would never fall in love with me if we dated because we just arent right for each other does that make me as a person unloveable no definitely not it just means i found someone who wasnt my person thats what dating is though and unfortunately sometimes it takes a few months or years to figure out that someone isnt your person be glad it was only a few months and remember that someone deciding you arent whatwho they want is usually an individual thing and not a comment on your general worth,MagicCarpet5846
honestly i wouldnt be okay with my partner doing this either,MagicCarpet5846
lol yes blame the abuse victim for going back to his support system because hes a man,MagicCarpet5846
thank you for proving you cannot read because there was not a single curse in that comment,MagicCarpet5846
no one said verbal abuse between parents doesnt affect kids i simply said abuse directed at the parents isnt treated as abuse directed at kids in the eyes of the law but you have made it crystal clear you have some utterly abhorrent reading comprehension so at least that makes sense why you dont understand the difference have a good day now,MagicCarpet5846
he is probably disenchanted with serious dating right now and likely wasnt very interested in you either if i had to take a guess he is having trouble finding and keeping someone he feels that intense chemistry with and has decided to only look for casual sex now its his journey and his burden to bear i wouldnt let it weigh too much on you youll find someone who treats you well but i would start by setting a higher bar for yourself than 6 months in and never being on a date,MagicCarpet5846
theres an exceptionally large difference between parking illegally in a private residential spot and an emergency services access area and you know it the issue is exactly that people who take a mild inconvenience and definitely ah behavior like taking someones assigned spot in an apartment and trying to inflate it to as bad a crime as indirectly leading to someones death worthy of the same punishment thank you for proving my point too many people dont know how to differentiate,MagicCarpet5846
nta this is when you say family doesnt take advantage of other family you used grandma and im not letting you use me too if you dont knock it off im blocking you all and any breaks you or your kids have been getting from me will end,MagicCarpet5846
and just stick to it be firm your uncle is a leech and will bleed you dry if you arent firm and willing to follow through with cutting him out entirely you wont keep that inheritance for long as hell find a way to suck it from you too,MagicCarpet5846
info its legal in your state why did he feel the need to hide this information if hes at the point where he feels shame for his habit its an addictiondependency and he needs professional intervention otherwise there is no reason to hide information with no legal repercussions from medical staff,MagicCarpet5846
well remember that not everyone is responsible and only spends the money they have this is how people end up with payday loans or tens of thousands of dollars in credit card debt,MagicCarpet5846
you act like people are responsible and only spend money they have you can take out loans to pay for a wedding or go into credit card debt,MagicCarpet5846
the weekends were something she asked for in the future that isnt happening now you need to go and read the post again she works 66 5 days a week its not an abnormal work schedule and i repeat working until 6 pm doesnt make you an unfit parent yes even getting home at 7 pm fighting with your husband does not make you an unfit parent does it make you a good parent no but you seem to think if you arent a perfect parent a court will say oh nope you cant see your kids anymore they should go with their dad and that just isnt how it works,MagicCarpet5846
understand this being a bad parent and an unfit parent are not the same thing and this woman is a bad parent but she is not an unfit mother the courts will not take her right to see her children away from her and make it so the father can leave the country with them,MagicCarpet5846
hopefully the caps will get through your thick skull and if not im not going to keep explaining to you the basic concept of wanting something to be true does not make it true,MagicCarpet5846
nah she sounds 19,MagicCarpet5846
definitely dont text him again im not judging for casual sex but dont let yourself be used for sex like that he isnt that interested and he would only agree to hang out because eh i guess she isnt bad enough not to fuck and i am horny and not because of you as a person you can use your hand or a toy and have a better time than that sorry he isnt interested it will likely happen with most guys you sleep with if it isnt an established relationshipclose to beforehand its okay to decide you are or arent okay with that reality but proceed accordingly in the future to what youre okay with,MagicCarpet5846
it could be idk but i am unfortunately familiar with excessive gaming being because of an affair so i wont project but definitely a thing a way more common than i ever wanted to know thing,MagicCarpet5846
but the rest of my comment stands affair or no affair doesnt seem to change the heart of the issue and her unwillingness to change said issues you can choose yourself and allow yourself to be happy shes chosen to be miserable it would seem you dont need to go along for that ride though,MagicCarpet5846
trauma bonding and codependency are definitely a thing and wouldnt surprise me if it played a role here i feel for oop but i wish she treated herself better than to keep putting up with this much drama for what can be at best considered a difficult relationship i hope the wedding is uneventful for her sake,MagicCarpet5846
hahaha well the idea of her cheating or not aside i think if you view your partner having an affair as an improvement you should take that as a pretty big sign that something is fundamentally broken in your relationship and if your partner is unwilling or unable to see and work towards fixing that then maybe the relationship isnt meant to work out,MagicCarpet5846
its okay btw for you to leave youre right you dont deserve this and you cant make someone get help if shes refusing to make any changes it seems as though there is only two paths forward you both stay miserable or only she stays miserable maybe one day shell choose happiness but you cant choose that for her you can choose it for yourself though,MagicCarpet5846
yeah op said there was nowhere else to park in the post and it was 2 am and they were tired plus honestly i personally wouldnt go the confrontation route too many crazy people in the world,MagicCarpet5846
she literally works until 6 pm in the post most people get off work at 5 its an hour different most people arent unfit or unable to be there for their kids so the hour isnt going to change that,MagicCarpet5846
she is absolutely abusive to her husband but none of that is directed at her kids you want to make it the same thing as being abusive to her kids and i get it really i do but it just isnt in the eyes of the law shes completely fit to be a mom this isnt about me saying she isnt abusive this is about me pointing out she is abusive to her husband not her kids there is no way she will be deemed unfit by a court so his choices are either stay in an abusive situation or leave to his home country if she wont willingly give up her kids then there may be a tough choice to be made i cant tell you how many tragic stories ive heard of women in the same positions who needed to escape abuse and their partners used the kids as a pawn if you dont understand this sad reality idk what to tell you,MagicCarpet5846
absolutely be kind to yourself you can and should allow yourself to feel how you feel the panic attacks crying not eating thats real heartbreak even the constantly checking his location it isnt healthy but it is totally normal you can allow yourself to give into it for a bit but make sure to give yourself a hard deadline for fully indulging your sadness because you dont want to lose yourself in this you will survive this you will find someone else and they will make you forget the pain youre feeling now thats life and just remember youll make it through this whatever happens,MagicCarpet5846
working until 6 pm and having a shitty marriage is not child abuse not by any legal definition which is all that will matter im sorry but youre just factually wrong about how a custody battle would look you can say what you think should happen until youre blue in the face but it just isnt how it works no judge will say this is abuse because it isnt working until 6 pm isnt not having time for your kids its called having a job its delusional to imply thats abusive its a fucking extra hour on the normal work schedule plenty of people work until 5 and have a 115 hour commute i just cannot fathom how you can intelligently argue working until 6 pm means you dont have time for your kids,MagicCarpet5846
his support system is in another country he may not be able to afford to live in this country alone with his kids that means yes the options are either stay in an abusive situation or leave because unless his wife willing allows him to take the kids he cannot take the kids you want the world to work a certain way and i get that but it doesnt,MagicCarpet5846
lmao yeah the sub that notoriously has a huge gender bias against men having a huge gender bias against men is shocking,MagicCarpet5846
your partner telling you no planning a bunch of activities to prevent you from being able to and then using your kids as a pawn to prevent you from having any free time to go see your friend because shes not comfortable going on the activities alone isnt controlling to you wtf of course that is the wife always plans the trips again imagine its because she forces herself in that role and doesnt allow op to plan things which is a pretty fair assumption with her blatantly telling him no when he asks to plan something here op asks to make time for his friend she flat out just says no and then makes it virtually impossible for him to actually go and do it on his own otherwise hell be the reason why his kids cant go do xyz for fun,MagicCarpet5846
you cannot genuinely tell me if a man did that to his wife you wouldnt be waving the red flag and honestly if you cant see how easily this is just a controlling partner then this conversation is pointless anyway because its pretty apparent to anyone who looks at behavior more than gender have a good day now,MagicCarpet5846
really you think thats less evidence of her being controlling that is the evidence for her being controlling just because hes a man and shes a woman lets not act like that changes anything,MagicCarpet5846
they very obviously only invited op because they know shes really good at planning and researching for these sort of trips it was about what she provides not her presence,MagicCarpet5846
its a road trip they clearly arent driving to get to a destination theyre driving to enjoy and experience the journey so its not the same as lets get a bit of sustenance its lets see what x city has to offer thats not a reason why they couldnt plan things though,MagicCarpet5846
its a 20 hour road trip at that point it seems rather obvious that part of the vacation is the driving and in that case yes i think its fair to want something more than mcdonalds you dont go to hawaii and do nothing but eat fast food ya know with gas car rentals hotels and food its definitely cheaper to fly if its a 20 hour trip so for sure this is supposed to be part of the experience for them,MagicCarpet5846
and experience which they absolutely only invited op on to plan things for them and they need to be adults and ya know plan things themselves,MagicCarpet5846
its good you recognized this is most likely heading towards a breakup i think its best to prepare yourself for it being a breakup and all of your emotions are natural you can give yourself a few weeks to grieve a 5 year relationship and make sure that next week you are firm in we are either together and you are in therapy working towards sorting yourself out or we are done and nc because anything else is going to destroy you and you need to look out for your mental health,MagicCarpet5846
he might be happier right now hes got friends around booze and feels a lot less pressure to be happy or act a certain way it sucks it isnt your fault you need to trust that this is part of his journey and isnt a reflection of you necessarily im sorry youre going through this be careful to let yourself feel the hurt while also cutting yourself off once its officially done from hurtful info his location his sm anything else that gives insight into his life moving forward it will only hurt,MagicCarpet5846
that is definitely not true i have known a number of people who meet a partner or fling or whatever you want to call it online playing video games never leaving their house,MagicCarpet5846
is she taking on the mental load or is she just a type a  personality and controlling because remember controlling people do exist and they can be women and it definitely sounds way more im doing things my way and you dont get a say rather than the typical nothing ever happens if i dont do everything and he never gives any input you see here,MagicCarpet5846
typically holier than thou redditor ego seeing as any rational human being knows having your car towed from a private property like that is going to be at least a few hundred bucks which unless youre quite wealthy is going to hurt at best and seriously endanger your financial wellbeing at worst dont park illegally but we also have no idea if this person got lost or what and the idea that we should treat any mistake as if its the end of the world acts as though people dont routinely make mistakes and they do some kindness and grace should be afforded for what is a normal human experience because even though you think well i would never do xyz that probably isnt as true as you think,MagicCarpet5846
you should sit him down outside of these moments and ask to talk about something with him honestly then say ive noticed a pattern lately well be talking and out of nowhere it seems like youll say im not funny and should stop trying to be funny but the reality is im not trying to be funny i have never tried to be funny this is just my personality and how i talk so it feels like youre not only criticizing my humor but also who i am its made me think and ive realized youve never even laughed at anything ive said and while i meant it when i said i never try to make you or anyone else laugh its made me think you dont enjoy me or my company much and thats becoming an issue for me we need to address so im hoping we can have an open discussion about whats been going on,MagicCarpet5846
eh its also been 3 months i dont really think you can conclusively say anything about what this other woman does or doesnt know,MagicCarpet5846
well have the conversation again and next time she replies with that just say okay then its clear the relationship isnt working out lets part ways shes either bluffing in which case you need to call it out or she isnt bluffing and its only a matter of time before she breaks up with you so might as well beat her to it and leave with your dignity,MagicCarpet5846
you literally just tell her plainly if this is how you feel we need to break up if you still want to stay together you need to stop the comments which one and make her pick and hold her to whatever she picks if she refuses to pick tell her youve picked for her and its over,MagicCarpet5846
stop being so passive and firmly shut the behavior down and if she doesnt back down you end it pretty easy way to show someone what you will and wont tolerate,MagicCarpet5846
i think you just need to communicate with her are you really this unsure about our relationship because if you are i think we should end things now it isnt fair to either of us to stay in a relationship where youre having this much doubts and if you arent that unsure you need to really be mindful of your language because its starting to feel like you dont want to be with me and at this point its honestly making it difficult for me to want to continue seeing you,MagicCarpet5846
and then see where the conversation goes but really if she doesnt say hey youre right this was super uncool behavior im sorry and ill work on it you probably should just end things sooner rather than later as its pretty obvious this isnt a relationship made to stand the test of time so if marriage is a goal of yours why even bother here anymore move on to someone who will be sure of you,MagicCarpet5846
lmao props to you for not even blinking at the ultimate manipulation your family tried to play and just shutting it down so hard even the cops breaking up a house party would be impressed,MagicCarpet5846
he was also very likely getting ready to end it if op hadnt im unhappy in our relationship means if you dont change im out,MagicCarpet5846
youre aware your opinion doesnt change how courts sometimes handle these situations right no it isnt okay but generally unless the kids are in physical danger courts try to keep both parents in their life the husband wouldnt be able to get her deemed unfit and take them out of the country this isnt a comment on how things should be but a reminder that unfortunately no she is not unfit to be a mother and unfortunately if the husbands support system is in another country he wont really be able to take his kids with him unless the wife will allow it and she doesnt seem the type to do so freely,MagicCarpet5846
you did though what do you think saying someone is unfit to be a mother means,MagicCarpet5846
also 300 m2 isnt really big enough for two separate families i dont know if you are currently or ever plan to have a family or even just a partnerpet but while 300 m2 is good for you and your needs it isnt really a two family house as a permanent set up which this obviously would be,MagicCarpet5846
that is definitely not how it works plenty of parents work until 6 pm 5 days a week and arent forbidden from seeing their kids thats insane to suggest,MagicCarpet5846
and even her abuse means nothing if it isnt provably directed towards her children family custody battles unfortunately are notorious for failing to take into consideration abuse of a partner when deciding custody if she gets even partial custody he cant just move them out of the country,MagicCarpet5846
might not be an option abusive partners often dont just let you walk away with their children and i dont think he would legally be able to just take them without a custody arrangement to another country unfortunately leaving an abusive relationship isnt always easy and there isnt always an easy solution when someone wants to make your life miserable and willing to use your children as pawns just to hurtcontrol you,MagicCarpet5846
sure but theres also plenty of free porn too that doesnt stop people from paying the thousands of gothwhatever other category of girl on of out there,MagicCarpet5846
does abuse actually change things though its an unfortunate situation but i dont think it changes the issue of op wants time alone with his family and doesnt want to be paying for things for harper like a father figure would thats an acceptable boundary to have yes even if abuse is at play after all if jennifer is aware enough to tell amber there is abuse at play shes aware enough to also know that she shouldnt be staying and exposing her kid to that environment,MagicCarpet5846
you do you but its unreasonable to suggest you wont even leave your house until your long term boyfriend is where he said he would meet you,MagicCarpet5846
trying without any belief it will change isnt trying its going through the motions,MagicCarpet5846
therapy is a joke because youve decided its a joke of course if you go into something convinced it will never help it wont help  thats like thinking everyone will break up with you you make yourself so miserable to be around it becomes a selffulfilling prophecy,MagicCarpet5846
he cheated on you and feels guilty,MagicCarpet5846
op said she was living with this guy talking about fantasies of marriage and shes also extremely close to this cousin the cousin knew op had a pregnancy scare with her summer fling she just didnt have a name or a face apparently which feels so weird to me possible absolutely just so weird,MagicCarpet5846
ok pause youre saying youre still not over the ex you had at 22 its time for therapy no you arent unlovable but you are stagnating yourself its okay not to be over him but you need help its time to love yourself enough to get it,MagicCarpet5846
i think you need to be honest with her and be very very blunt hey friend sorry to message but i didnt want to wait until closer to the wedding i love you and want to support you as much as i can on your special day but i have a very hard budget for how much i can spend in total on the wedding its x ive already contributed y i wanted to be really clear that from now on i cant contribute anything else and i am not comfortable asking people who dont know you to come to any paid events if you no longer want me to be a bridesmaid i will step down and be a regular guest because i dont want to be a source of stress for you but ive felt a lot of pressure to spend more than i am able to and while i understand its unintentional i want to be really transparent with you,MagicCarpet5846
and then go from there,MagicCarpet5846
you would be incredibly selfish to message him knowing he is in a relationship let him move on if they break up and youre still single and feel this way reach out but know your place do not invite that sort of bad karma into the world,MagicCarpet5846
id do it over facetime in your backyard garage or even walking to a park,MagicCarpet5846
just tell him then i want a kid and that hasnt changed if youve changed youre mind thats youre right but were no longer compatible i hope we can split quickly and amicably as i wish you no ill will but am firm on what i want in life,MagicCarpet5846
for either side shes allowed to be willing to die on this hill but honestly if she knew her sibling was at risk and knew she was offering a safe haven that should have been a conversation she had with her boyfriend long before it came to fruition then they couldve had the discussion and had a plan and he wouldnt have felt like an outsider in his own home,MagicCarpet5846
to be honest i would figure out if you can move on from this if you cant and no one would blame you simply tell her you found her notes and want a divorce but decide beforehand i would either accept it and leave it be or tell her youre looking for a divorce but i wouldnt tell her what you found and expect your marriage to survive,MagicCarpet5846
i mean hey if youve decided how you want to handle it go ahead i hope it goes as well as it can,MagicCarpet5846
well she very realistically may be sacrificing her relationship she seems okay with it but she shouldve been more upfront about her priorities,MagicCarpet5846
look fam if youre willing to be dumped over this go ahead but fully understand that youre in the wrong here not him you always communicate beforehand even if the answer is i am helping my sibling and if you are unwilling to support me in this its a dealbreaker but you need to have that conversation first hed be a fool to propose to a woman who cant even respect him enough to give him a phone call before agreeing your sibling can wait another 20 minutes,MagicCarpet5846
yeah but even before all that how did op know her cousin was in the same school and major yet never mention his name to the cousin or so much as a picture i know my closest friends partners names and faces well enough that i would definitely recognize them if they showed up in my physics class,MagicCarpet5846
dont even wait 3 days tell her she needs to get a job and start contributing let her start the divorce herself,MagicCarpet5846
if you want to protect yourself you get in front of it dont just wait for him to decide hes built a strong enough case instead strike first,MagicCarpet5846
info have you contacted the school and asked for an exception because most schools will give out more than the two tickets if you ask,MagicCarpet5846
i mean the reality is what other choice does she have live in her car she has no family or friends around is attending a school with poor resources and doesnt make enough to easily afford a new place sometimes you have to act ignorant for self preservation not everyone has the luxury to immediately and shamelessly leave shitty situations,MagicCarpet5846
idk man the facts here i see no way for op to go hey you need to pay for a new place for me and the grandma to go oh okay here you go i mean like i guess maybe she could but i very much doubt it especially because ops boyfriend would likely step in and even if he didnt i dont really see a world where a landlord is legally required to provide alternative accommodation and legally unable to simply terminate the lease hence it being a situation that would likely require a legal battle if theres even any chance of success which im dubious of i dont really care to get into a back and forth on hypothetical legal situations though suffice to say ops housing situation sounds on borrowed time so shes better off focusing on that right now and only then looking into anything else if shes so inclined because im sure if she tried anything legal with her boyfriends elderly grandmother unless she has backup accommodations right then and there he isnt going to continue living with her as she tries to sue his grandma or even send a strongly worded legal letter,MagicCarpet5846
definitely op needs to learn renters rights and how to protect herself but at this point in time she probably has much more pressing matters than any potential recourse rethe old apartment sometimes unfortunately you learn lessons the hard way long expensive and complicated legal battles arent always the answer,MagicCarpet5846
theres a good chance it wouldnt go anywhere landlords are under no obligation to inform you about renters insurance thats your own responsibility to limit your own liability some places landlords can require it but ive never heard of anywhere saying a landlord needs to usually the way the law is written a landlord either needs to repair the damage or if the place is uninhabitable they can terminate the lease which it sounds like is what she likely did i obviously dont know the law everywhere but dont feel bad about not wanting to pursue anything legally as i cant imagine a judge seeing i didnt know i needed insurance why didnt anyone tell me as a very good excuse,MagicCarpet5846
im sure it depends but if the place is uninhabitable the landlord is allowed usually to just end the lease which is what it sounds like she did typically landlords are only under obligation for their home to be habitable and in the case where it isnt end the lease not to provide adequate housing elsewhere if their accommodations are uninhabitable renters insurance is what provides accommodation if yours is unavailable and its definitely not the responsibility of the landlord to tell you about renters insurance thats on you to do research and decide some places require it but thats mostly for their own protections op can definitely try to double check but given her situation her time money and effort would probably be better spent finding a place to live that meets her needs and she can afford on her own as i suspect this friend wont let op stay much longer much less past when the bf inevitably lets the beans spill,MagicCarpet5846
you probably dont want to hear it but unless you have a backup plan no i would not say anything to him right now things are only somewhat fine because hes under the impression youre none the wiser as soon as you let him know there is no reason to pretend theres a goooood chance things get very ugly and at this point it seems like the people youre living with are only letting you stay because of your boyfriend you gotta look out for yourself number 1 so take this information and plan find an apartment on your own and get a move in date of asap only then should you bring it up as most likely once you do hell be honest with you and good chance you get kicked out of where youre staying,MagicCarpet5846
probably would send them a were so happy you want to celebrate officially becoming a family but we are holding off on the big celebration with a dress and photos until baby is old enough to be a part this is important to us and hope you will respect our feelings as they wont change that being said wed love to have you and fiances parents said this was as your husband should be sending the message not you over for dinner to celebrate all of the good fortune in our lives lately,MagicCarpet5846
did you buy or sell i dont know if the person who boughtsold it did so maybe the real estate agent honestly i have no idea how it works and id say it usually is pretty accurate but it definitely can be inaccurate and i suspect it has to do with someone incorrectly reporting it fringe case for sure but zillow definitely isnt getting the info from the government for every sale thats for sure,MagicCarpet5846
but yes i saw the price and was a bit annoyed i wish i didnt have to spend that extra 100k but i definitely did,MagicCarpet5846
500k in lottery winnings comes with a minimum 125k in federal taxes and a potential additional 44k in state taxes that means he only got a maximum of 330375k thats still a lot of money but it isnt buy my family a house money or retire early money and thats assuming he was in a position to save all of it but most likely he had some debts or large purchases he was able to make with that money like student loans credit card debt maybe he paid off a mortgage or bought a new car,MagicCarpet5846
it sucks but money doesnt go anywhere near as far as people think it does especially when you factor in taxes so just remember even with that huge leg up you probably canshould still have sympathy for him for all that stuff,MagicCarpet5846
yep and for mine it shows a completely and wildly inaccurate price thats more than 100k less than i paid and a price that was never even remotely possible so while yes its a good starting point it isnt always 100 accurate,MagicCarpet5846
just a heads up those arent accurate and must be selfreported by someone the house i bought was listed as being sold for well over 100k less than i paid and since i know how much i paid i know that zillow was very much not correct,MagicCarpet5846
well theyre only 22 now so i would probably say theres not a huge difference between discussing it when theyre 1819 the ages they actually were as they met at 15 and were together for 3 years and at 22 its really only 3 years different and yes you change in that time but idk if youre really ready for marriage at that point where you werent before ya know but also i just find it so hard to understand how op can be madly in love with him and living with him but her cousin who shes really close to and is in the same major and school as had no idea nor did kenny how did you not say anything all my friends knew about my partner within a few dates certainly 3 years and marriage talks would never happen without showing a picture or giving a name especially if i knew someone knew my partner from outside of me and then how can you have that sort of heartbreak its rather obvious kenny ended things and not say anything to your cousin about it like hey dont date him im not over him idk man sounds really weird,MagicCarpet5846
again doctors are more than just mds and even so yes the starting average salary is 211k for medical doctors thats after residency but you can complete your residency in your midlate 20s especially if you do medical school in another country or take advantage of a number of accelerated programs that pretty much every med school offers,MagicCarpet5846
remember just because you havent had this experience doesnt mean it hasnt and cant happen to someone else my niece has just graduated as a doctor yes being vague to illustrate my point and makes 185k at 24 with a signing bonus of over 10k and my sibling who graduated a few years ago was able to purchase a 4 bedroom home in a really nice area at 23 this one not a doctor but in a well paying field i wouldnt call it a mansion but its an impressive achievement at 23,MagicCarpet5846
it happens it might not be common but personal experiences on reddit arent supposed to be the average experience theyre supposed to be what happens to you so try to open your perspective on what you see as possible more and dont discount something as an obvious trollfake just because you personally havent seen something happen but in the end totally up to you what to think of what you read on the internet,MagicCarpet5846
its grossly selfish to stay in a relationship with the intention of thinking you can change her mind so assume she is 100 serious on never wanting kids if you know wanting kids is a must have in your life to the best of your abilities you two are fundamentally incompatible and the only honorable thing to do is leave her to find someone who doesnt want kids either,MagicCarpet5846
if you think the right person is worth not having kids for i would be very honest with her so she is allowed the choice as well i have always wanted kids but i also feel a very strong connection with you i am not asking you to change your mind but more i am open to seeing if our relationship develops into something more where i accept not being a father but i also want to give you the choice on if youre on board because i cant guarantee how i will feel in the future and dont want to put you in an unfair position if we ultimately do disagree,MagicCarpet5846
now chances are she probably will also say hey lets call it here and save us the potential heartbreak but at least youre being open and respecting this woman enough to communicate openly with her so many guys hear a woman say i do not want children and think it means i dont want kids right now or think to themselves well its too early to think about kids anyway so lets reevaluate in a few monthsyears but no do not do that this is why people bring it up early because they dont want to be in love with someone and have to break up they know if theres a fundamental incompatibility its just not worth pursuing the relationship further because you can be on the same page in everything and a relationship still fail why pursue one where its break is inevitable,MagicCarpet5846
uhm yes lol it is the pandemic completely changed the game for salaries in fields with burnout and high demand,MagicCarpet5846
dentists average starting is 123k with source,MagicCarpet5846
doctors sources vary pretty widely depending on specialty but average entry level doctor salary is 211k with source,MagicCarpet5846
vets 107k average starting salary with source,MagicCarpet5846
and this is average starting meaning a lot of people make substantially more than this right out of the gate i know a number of people who were graduating this year and had 150k offers with starting bonuses just because they were well educated and theres such a high demand right now and not enough supply i dont really know why its so surprising to see why a specialized field in medicine would start out low six figures even nurses right now are making 100k starting in certain areas location matters your education matters the experience you gained in school matters heck even your connections matter but its definitely not a crazy idea to me at all that someone out there could be a doctor and have a nice ass house before theyre 30,MagicCarpet5846
girl come now dont be so dense hes 8 years older than you and already trying to isolate you he wants you to move in with him and is displaying an issue with your job he wants you to be financially reliant on him to survive and if you are then you cant go back to school to finish your degree hes doing his best to make you his good little housewife and youre playing right into it,MagicCarpet5846
youre going through something serious and something scary you are looking for support and youre not getting it you and your boyfriend are both so young that its no surprise he isnt equipped to handle this well but neither of you are handling the stress too well,MagicCarpet5846
you shouldnt need to make up anything as you did nothing wrong ultimately even though it hurts you need to accept that he is entitled to feel how he feels and if hes unable to be understanding and supportive of his sick and scared girlfriend he isnt the right one for you,MagicCarpet5846
i mean no lol they are definitely also doctors and its also the internet its not super uncommon for people to be intentionally vague about personal details but anyway like i said its definitely an unusual path but totally possible to be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house,MagicCarpet5846
i was the one who added the med school the other person just said a doctor you can become a doctor a number of ways without going to med school,MagicCarpet5846
so i reiterate you can definitely be a doctor in your mid 20s and have a really nice house maybe uncommon definitely doable though,MagicCarpet5846
its not even an okay marriage and youre thinking of staying man you do you but youre only 30 if just okay is your standard you can find just okay with someone who isnt going to cheat on you,MagicCarpet5846
not residency thats totally true but could be a vet or a dentist which makes 6 figures right out of school and are still doctors,MagicCarpet5846
no hes over it at this point and moved on to someone else most likely trying to fix things is going to make you seem creepy and desperate at this point just let it go youve learned something about dating and about yourself and take that with you for future experiences,MagicCarpet5846
i agree here but she also shouldnt have sex with him if shed feel used if it was just sex because its very possible thats how it ends too and she shouldnt have sex if it will harm her mental health just to potentially keep someone around either,MagicCarpet5846
am i the only one who thinks its at least a little bit wrong to effectively try to manipulate someone into a relationship by using sex as a bargaining chip im not saying its wrong to wait to have sex at all but based on the post it very much feels like she was only waiting because she was playing a game,MagicCarpet5846
true could easily be a dentist or vet which are doctors no residency required and both have six figure starting salaries like i said definitely possible even if not the path most take,MagicCarpet5846
as for student loans i know when i was in school more people than you would think graduated without substantial student loans either trough scholarships help from parents or working through school but that also was very heavily influenced by my going to a top school where most of my class was well off im just a proponent of even if something isnt possible for you doesnt mean it isnt possible for anyone lol,MagicCarpet5846
question why were you on your laptop and taking calls when hosting a number of friends in your home you hadnt seen in a bit that seems to break a lot of hosting etiquette rules and while im not calling you an ah for it does seem like if you werent on your laptop or taking calls in the first place this wouldnt have happened,MagicCarpet5846
fam youre clearly way too young to be on the internet if you think the employees would ever call the cops and in the event they did that the cops would do anything more than generally gesture to take a look into it and never follow up,MagicCarpet5846
i mean its not actually as wild as you think you graduate from school at around 2425 if you go straight through and your starting salary can easily be 175k with the demand right now with large starting bonuses and even more if you go into criticalemergency care you could feasibly be 2526 and with that level of income afford a 500k600k house which in the right area could absolutely be a mansion or pretty close and yes i am talking about in todays day and age not 25 years ago,MagicCarpet5846
definitely not the path most take but if you prioritize buying a home over renting i know plenty of mid 20s who own homes and they dont have nearly the income a new doctor today would have,MagicCarpet5846
eta true med school requires residency but dentists and vets dont require residency and are making 100175k right out of school so like i said comment still stands just because something is uncommon doesnt mean its entirely impossible,MagicCarpet5846
did we get an age on the friend he could be older and away at college and in an apartment rentedowned by family oop being 18 doesnt necessarily mean all of his friends are his age and i knew plenty of people who lived in apartmentshouses their family owned while away at school,MagicCarpet5846
thats why it was so crazy everyone was blaming oop for simply saying to leave her out of this one i mean hes a parent to two children and it should be on him to manage his own relationship with his daughter rather than relying on the stepmom to always be the manager i feel like its super common for people to give the advice stop fixing things for xyz otherwise theyll never learn how to deal with it on their own yet here when oop simply comes to the conclusion of i wont be fixing things this time he needs to learn shes in the wrong just interesting how differently people can perceive the exact same behavior based on if it was advice they gave or just naturally how a person decides to handle a situation there was no easy answer here but i get oop wanting to be able to not always be the decision maker,MagicCarpet5846
did she delete some posts because the ones i see now while clearly paint her as deeply unhappy in the relationship shows shes more of the problem than him or at least theyre equally the problem,MagicCarpet5846
hahaha you mean like a teenager would be upset hes told he needs to finish his chores before he goes out with his friends,MagicCarpet5846
theyre definitely not that much anymore unless youre trying to find something expensive i went to a show a few months ago and it was 200 for the most expensive seats there were and plenty of options in the 50 range if you want to do a broadway show it doesnt need to be break the bank expensive,MagicCarpet5846
op is an electrical engineer engineers are pretty unanimously across the us excluded from overtime pay as it is a professional and has the advanced degree exemption,MagicCarpet5846
i mean he clearly picked her when he yelled at you for your behavior so i wouldnt test this any further if i were you and would just apologize and offer to step down from the wedding party or wear whatever dress they pick whatever they prefer,MagicCarpet5846
otherwise kiss your friendship with mark goodbye,MagicCarpet5846
you should try to repair the relationship but also be aware some of them may not want an enabler in their lives anymore,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846
see  for more info,MagicCarpet5846
i mean her behavior in this story alone should be enough to tell you its entirely possible she cut them all off for not doing exactly as she said,MagicCarpet5846
id just send one message saying if you truly feel badly about what you did let me move on and stop contacting me i have no ill will towards you anymore but i also have no desire to have you in my life in any capacity,MagicCarpet5846
oh no it gets worse later it can start very young though,MagicCarpet5846
if op says he doesnt love her thats totally fair but a month is plenty of time for love for plenty of people she definitely needs some help but she doesnt appear to be looking for a victimsupply she sounds like any other insecure 22 year old who doesnt know how to self regulate their emotions and is hoping a guy will do it for her try not to have the darkest outlook possible on peoples intentions when there is a way more common and way more likely answer in that shes just emotionally immature and struggling with her own demons,MagicCarpet5846
you should be encouraging her to get some therapy because you dont like hearing someone you love say such things,MagicCarpet5846
well this was a new partner and you frankly arent entitled to know about a deeply personal letter like that you said this happened in the beginning of your relationship,MagicCarpet5846
hes 7 good chance hes using sky because it pisses his mom off tell her to lay off and take away the appeal of sky being the rebellious name and then maybe hell change his mind in time or he wont but telling a little boy they cant do something only ever makes them want to do it more,MagicCarpet5846
how long was that stick,MagicCarpet5846
correct but this is an established thing tm in the horse world,MagicCarpet5846
you dont sound like youre a big horse person horse people flock to horse people and can be as cliquey as high school mean girls its no surprise the two of them would gravitate to one another when they share such a massive hobby and love of horses it also sounds like youre projecting your feelings of loneliness onto the man instead talk to your wife tell her you miss one on one time and ask to carve out some time for a date night and her horse back riding communication is key and a marriage takes work on both parties if you communicate your needs and ask her to help problem solve on how to make time to reconnect im sure these feelings youre projecting onto the friends husband will dissipate because the real issue here is you dont feel like youre spending enough alone time with your wife,MagicCarpet5846
this is only 3 months in the fuck just send him a message back you keep trying to guilt me about who loves who more yet you dont even feel strongly enough about me to be in a genuine relationship at this point its really clear everything you say is just manipulation to keep getting in my pants and i respectful myself enough to stop allowing the disrespect i dont think its a good idea for us to be friends after this its clear you dont have my best interests at heart and are only interested in getting your dick wet dont worry im sure someone other than me can fill that role goodbye and goodluck,MagicCarpet5846
then block him hes just using you and thinks you have no self esteem prove him wrong,MagicCarpet5846
interesting i see the opposite on reddit everyone says that you should be willing to love your partner regardless of weightappearance i definitely disagree there within reason 510 lbs whatever a significantly change in appearancelifestyle that now clashes with yours though is as much an incompatibility as anything else,MagicCarpet5846
but yes i agree especially before youre in a relationship if youve struggled with weight its totally understandable not wanting to be with someone you think wouldnt be able to handle fluctuations in weight never put yourself in a relationship you think might weigh on your own mental well being,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you can decide not to date someone for literally any reason yes,MagicCarpet5846
no were talking about exactly the same thing people who think weight doesnt matter and attractionlack thereof isnt a valid reason not to date someone are delusional but its also fair to not want to date someone who rejected you before solely because of your weight or even just someone who rejected you before but now cant get anyone better and is desperate this is one of those no one is wrong but actions have consequences moments,MagicCarpet5846
we can not judge them and also recognize that someone you rejected for any reason probably wont want to be a second choice,MagicCarpet5846
where do you live id like to read into this,MagicCarpet5846
i mean he said in more words that he was an ah for the sake of being an ah because the elderly couple did something a little sneaky too seems like no one is amazing here though i cant blame the elderly couple for giving a try something they probably saw online and had no idea it wouldnt work,MagicCarpet5846
am i the only one not believing hes actually bad at giving gifts and its just that op thinks anything other than exactly what she wants is terrible i mean a terrible gift giver doesnt just come up with a thoughtful gift like this and the coaching more sounds like her just telling him exactly what to get and since she clearly didnt this year he still got a lovely gift and put together a sweet day for her,MagicCarpet5846
it probably wouldnt be a bad idea to just know if you have toxic plants on the property not sure if theyre toxic just to pets or to kids as well or even if you ever invite kids over but just being able to quickly know in an emergency is never a bad idea even if its something as simple as asking the gardener to text you when he plants something new,MagicCarpet5846
get the annulment and then sue her in civil court for the cost of things you may not win but you might its easy to represent yourself,MagicCarpet5846
fam youre the problem here not the ex and not the boyfriend,MagicCarpet5846
it depends on what vibe youre going for is this a new partner or an established relationship you dont look cute but you do look ready to hike if youre the type who want someone who loves you even with no effort this is fine because youre dressed for the activity if you still want to look cute and functional there are hikingathletic skirts you could do two braids in your hair and a cuter more fitting tank topsports bra and matching socks instead,MagicCarpet5846
and a lot of sunscreen,MagicCarpet5846
its either couples therapy or divorce but he isnt an intentional abuser who would use therapy only to find new ways to abuse op hes just letting his own issues be taken out on op theres a difference the bigger issue is with op just working in a call center and both having extreme health issues and him being unemployed they likely cant afford couples therapy anyway,MagicCarpet5846
well ask him if moving in together would help otherwise move on,MagicCarpet5846
bury his head in the sand the same way you are to the fact that your boyfriend very obviously doesnt want to marry you,MagicCarpet5846
he doesnt want to propose to you and he doesnt want to marry you if he would marry you with no one watching he wouldve been happy to let you propose hes lying to you and youre letting him because that hurts less than the reality that he doesnt want to marry you but is fine enough to continue dating you indefinitely,MagicCarpet5846
i mean at this point your choices are stay as just a girlfriend and drop the desire to be engaged or wait until you piss him off and he dumps you,MagicCarpet5846
i mean by staying youve just told him he actually never needs to propose and youll just stay giving an ultimatum you dont really mean is a deaths blow for ever getting the thing in this case marriage you want he is never proposing he is never asking your father for your hand in marriage you either get over it and accept it or you leave but youve totally screwed yourself over for any chance of him ever proposing now because youve proven your words and threats are meaningless,MagicCarpet5846
honestly esh learn to say no and leave it at that stop adding qualifiers and allowing yourself to be walked all over let the 100 go but also just tell him that you dont want to hire him and let that be it no reasons no chance to change your mind,MagicCarpet5846
so you want this to happen again i mean do you think itll get easier if this keeps happening,MagicCarpet5846
the space will be helpful because itll help distinguish between himyou actually wanting to work on things together or you two just being afraid of being alone if hes holding on because hes just afraid of the unknown then once he gets over that the marriage will be done anyway taking that space makes it more likely that if you move forward its genuine and it also just helps to emphasize what being without you would be like rather than giving him a nice easy transition to leaving you,MagicCarpet5846
the first question you need an answer to is does he want to work things out with you the second question you need an answer to is do you want to work things out with him if you can both answer yes  he needs to cut her out and send a message saying i feel our friendship is starting to cross a boundary that isnt appropriate for either of us to continue speaking outside of work it isnt about you but i am going to focus on my marriage,MagicCarpet5846
the next thing is he needs to block her you both need to sign up for marriage counseling and likely individual counseling too then you two should take a break from one another sleep in separate rooms for at least 6 weeks while youre working through your feelings and how to move forward distance does make the heart grow fonder and often our desire to latch on even tighter in these moments makes it less likely the relationship survives,MagicCarpet5846
he needs to be honest with you about what he thinks she gets that you dont and be willing to say the things he thinks are too hurtful you need to be willing to hear him say some really painful things too only once all the issues are out in the open can you two begin to assess if this relationship is fixable but it starts by deciding if you two are both willing to make it work and you are both willing to make serious changes otherwise theres no real point in trying itll only hurt you more,MagicCarpet5846
i mean plenty of people are shit heads throughout their entire 20s so theres still help there it isnt a magic switch when you turn 25 its just that the brain is finally developed but theres plenty of people that dont even start to grow up until that point so hopefully theres hope for her,MagicCarpet5846
nta if this man were anyone other than your husband youd be the ah you are fully within your rights to tell your husband another woman has a crush on him to ensure proper boundaries are always maintained doesnt matter if the other woman is family or not,MagicCarpet5846
it was a mothers day meal i would hope she wouldnt be a teenager,MagicCarpet5846
info you guys are married,MagicCarpet5846
did you forget that once you get married its no longer mine and yours but ours it makes no difference which one of your cards were used,MagicCarpet5846
youre giving him way too much leniency and its going to bite you in the ass and hard,MagicCarpet5846
unless you want to follow in her footsteps you need to set down some iron clad expectations with your husband because hes your issue here if he isnt willing to put your comfort first you probably wont stay married very long,MagicCarpet5846
its not the idea of someone asking you to choose its the idea of two separate peoples entire family asking them to choose despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7 years and three other completely unrelated people to op,MagicCarpet5846
once believable twice kinda weird but sure no less than seven people from five different upbringings nah unless you were raised in a cult but op already said they werent,MagicCarpet5846
well think about it this way do you think people who made mistakes are unable to ever change if you do know people can change and learn from poor choices theyve made why dont you think giving someone a chance is the right call hes a meth addict itll be easy to spot if hes still involved in shady shit and then if youre making a judgment based on current behavior go for it but at least give someone a chance to see if it is truly in the past or not,MagicCarpet5846
its the internet if you wanna act like a dumbass and say something blatantly incorrect and easily googleable dont be shocked when someone treats you like a dumbass,MagicCarpet5846
if you think someone correcting you is rude dont have such a fragile ego you cant take being wrong,MagicCarpet5846
that isnt the analogy you think it is and i already said elsewhere its birds belonging to the psittacine family dont comment correcting someone on something a quick google searches will give you the answer to there isnt really an excuse for misinformation in the age of the internet,MagicCarpet5846
apparently people in the sub about animals dont know what animals are but parrots are any bird in the psittacine family cockatiels are parrots budgies are parrots cockatoos are parrots macaws are parrots theres dozens of other species that are also parrots,MagicCarpet5846
think of it the same way youd think of a golden retriever golden retrievers are all dogs but not all dogs are golden retrievers same thing here,MagicCarpet5846
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever,MagicCarpet5846
cockatiels are parrots what did you think parrots were thats like saying a golden retriever isnt a dog its a golden retriever,MagicCarpet5846
what exactly do you think a parrot is,MagicCarpet5846
yeah its more understandable to get a fake diamond than fake shoes lmao,MagicCarpet5846
girl just admit you fucked up and apologize stop trying to make him the bad guy here it was you all you and just you,MagicCarpet5846
probably because shes drunk its her bachelorette party and people have been known to cheat during them and an ex came up to her and some really monogamous people can get really honest with alcohol involved so things dont look shady ive definitely done this before and while i looking back know it can seem more sus it really just came from drunk anxiety brain combined with i dont want to feel like im hiding something totally innocent from my fianc alcohol definitely impairs your cognitive skills i wouldnt read into it much unless you think something more serious happened,MagicCarpet5846
i would definitely tell my partner if i ran into an ex and i would expect them to do the same the alcohol likely just added a sense of urgency to her wanting you to know,MagicCarpet5846
info do you sincerely believe youll be happy for life with this man if not dont get married,MagicCarpet5846
i mean if you can afford it sure but at some point you kinda need to start advocating for yourself unless youre really cool spending all this money its okay to just say im sorry but i cant afford that right now i can do without the giftexperiencewhatever it is,MagicCarpet5846
damn i cant believe ive lived long enough to become the prude but yeah of course your relationship is going to suffer youre asking for nonmonogamy i would assume most men out there arent going to be okay with it personally you sound waaaay too immature for a serious relationship let alone a long distance one but if you want to start making content again you need to tell him and see if hes okay with it if he isnt you need to make a choice him and monogamy or the content and being single,MagicCarpet5846
its normal for your age but my god are 21 year old males shitheads sometimes,MagicCarpet5846
answer with a yes or no have you ever had sex with your stepmother,MagicCarpet5846
dude has about as strong a grip of sarcasm as he does on the meaning of the word emergency then,MagicCarpet5846
info are you telling me your sister decided she no longer wanted to get married but never communicated this to her fianc and the father of her kids because if so your sister is definitely an ah,MagicCarpet5846
ok if you think your relationship will be fine both from your and his perspectives then ask him to write up a lease to sign,MagicCarpet5846
youre better off moving out its not going to do your relationship with him any favors by moving to such a transactional relationship but hes in his right to decide what hell allow in his own home,MagicCarpet5846
youre 28 you can definitely start to move towards being an independent adult and living your life the way your want to,MagicCarpet5846
i mean itll shake out however you decide but you have two options move out or dont have your girlfriend over,MagicCarpet5846
you are aware that your smoking hurts a lot more people than you right thirdhand smoke has been proven to be cancerous youre literally contributing to the death of not only you people around you but also the people who enter a space after youve left,MagicCarpet5846
so four hours later youre still arguing how come you havent given us a list of everything you do and everything your wife does in caring for your home and your kids clearly you have the time,MagicCarpet5846
the morals that marriage is a lifelong commitment you shouldnt just make with people before you know who they are and before youre willing to commit to working things out,MagicCarpet5846
tell me you dont understand marriage without telling me you dont understand marriage,MagicCarpet5846
people should consider what marriage means before getting married that means both waiting until you know a person well enough to know there arent red flags hidden and it also means being willing to work through the shitty moments if you cant do it dont get married simple anyone you apparently who doesnt see that isnt really my problem enjoy your future divorce,MagicCarpet5846
if they actually stopped ignoring red flags and putting up with bullshit they wouldnt marry those people in the first place,MagicCarpet5846
again if thats your attitude dont get married i already made that clear its not like everyone needs to get married but people have stopped taking marriage seriously and thats why divorce rates are so high you want to be able to walk away at the first issue sure go right ahead dont get married then,MagicCarpet5846
legally and morally are different just because you can divorce someone for the color of their shirt doesnt mean you should if you think marriage is such a temporary commitment dont make it,MagicCarpet5846
i mean yes if you just assumed he wanted kids that was incredibly presumptuous and foolish of you generally a 38 year old with no kids who wants kids will mention it especially as youre now 35 and thats generally the end of when most people start trying to conceive its also somewhat reasonable for him to assume an older woman with kids who doesnt mention wanting them also would be on the same page with not wanting anymore,MagicCarpet5846
i suppose realistically at this point you need to do some tough thinking and potentially get your msh levels checked to get an idea on how easy it would be to conceive with someone else if thats even an option and if natural birth isnt possible if youre willing and able to pursue ivf or other means,MagicCarpet5846
might be difficult for her to see you treating another woman the way she wanted to be treated but clearly wasnt,MagicCarpet5846
ive seen similar things with women who ended a relationship with someone who wouldnt marry them when they find out the ex is getting married even if the women are in new and fulfilling relationships and no longer have feelings for the ex rejection and feelings of inadequacy can remain long after the love is gone,MagicCarpet5846
that being said she needs to handle her own shit and not bring it into your life set a clear boundary and if she cant agree time to put some distance between you and her and at custody swap you can send sky in by herself and you can wait in the car to pick her up,MagicCarpet5846
color is meh to me but the fit and length are actively bad it looks very grandmothers nightgown to me since you love the color this would be a beautiful piece if you took in and shortened the waist and then hemmed it somewhere above your knee whatever your preference,MagicCarpet5846
i mean probably says you prioritize being in a relationship rather than being comfortable as if i were allergic to an animal that would be the sort of thing i would ask about on a first date and not have a second with anyone with a cat,MagicCarpet5846
who hurt you,MagicCarpet5846
its not crazy its totally understandable if i may give you some advice my parents would always tell me if its meant to be itll be but never dull your shine for someone else you can leave and let him sort himself out if he does and the time is right maybe you two will reconnect in the future but if he wasnt meant to be your future youll move on and find that future every time ive been in a similar situation to yours my mom especially would encourage me to remember that if god intends it itll happen now i dont know if youre religious but i do think you will end up where youre meant to be and if thats with him youll find your way back to one another when he is healthier and if you arent meant to be and honestly i dont think you are then you will be freeing yourself to find that path youre meant to walk,MagicCarpet5846
i know apologies i just would hate to see such a young and vibrant woman with a bright future ruin it because shes willing to sacrifice herself for a man who would never do the same you deserve much more than this,MagicCarpet5846
nta if they need to crowdsource their wedding they need to downsize their wedding if they dont need to crowdsource their wedding you dont need to celebrate greedy ass people,MagicCarpet5846
eh of all the things wrong with this dude drinking problem doesnt come to mind if he really had a drinking problem he likely wouldnt feel compelled to hide it from his wife and kids hed just be drunk,MagicCarpet5846
well youve done the equivalent and then some in this post and all of your comments arguing already so instead of trying to act like youre too good for writing a 7 paragraph comment just do it prove it actually give us the information so we can see everything you do that shows just how much you deserve that break once you do everyones attitude will change and well all see you deserve this break and your wife is asking too much of you trust me its happened before everyone is calling you an ah so if you really think were wrong answering this will make everyone see what you see,MagicCarpet5846
the only reason you would have for not is because you know damn well it would show just how little you do so which is it are you going to write out everything you do or are you admitting you do jack shit and leave everything to your wife,MagicCarpet5846
i mean nah she was extremely clear about not being able to handle you with short hair and you agreed i guess you didnt think that would be a dealbreaker and its an odd dealbreaker to have but thats trauma for you personally i would see if you can have a compromise where your hair is a bit longer than it is now but still short ish,MagicCarpet5846
or you can decide your journey is worth more to you than your marriage thats okay too but you cant have both its either your wife feeling safe in your marriage or your hair short i would personally not want my wife to feel unsafe over something as superficial as the length of my hair but i also wont call you an ah for changing your mind and wanting autonomy on how you look this might just mean the relationship has run its course it isnt your responsibility or fault that shes reacting like this but that doesnt change the reality that shes extremely triggered and a choice needs to be made here,MagicCarpet5846
hopefully your wife is in therapy though and can speak to them about this and see if she can work through her feelings in therapy,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity why do you want to mend things with an addict who is just using you as a meal ticket,MagicCarpet5846
you dont mean anything to him youre just a tool to survive right now maybe he once loved you but his addiction has taken away all of his ability to develop a genuine relationship with you youre 25 youd be frankly an idiot to sink your future investing in someone like this indefinitely,MagicCarpet5846
cut your losses and save yourself,MagicCarpet5846
well how about this walk me through a typical week be explicit go morning afternoon and evening walk us through what your wife does and what you do make sure you list every chore each of you does then we can all see exactly how not true it is that you dont do shit,MagicCarpet5846
or you could offer one,MagicCarpet5846
the rich and poor sure better or worse no thats often one or both people being a prick to the other no one stays married forever and isnt a prick to their partner at some point in time if its abuse obviously leave but theres a normal level of married couples are inevitably going to be shitheads at some point you cant just walk away the first time it happens,MagicCarpet5846
the divorce happened several years before he posted and hes still taking his kids on his time so i dont know if thats a fair comment to make,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think this is abusive which i think i made pretty clear but i do think op should not back down as shes already said she feels like maybe she should and i also am simply telling her to be hyper aware of if theres any additional red flags,MagicCarpet5846
i am also one of those people who doesnt like everything to be called abuse so i did say this itself does not mean he is an abuser but its definitely how a lot of people say it starts so shes better off keeping this in the back of her mind and finding nooner red flags than ignoring this one and looking back 5 years from now and realizing it started here,MagicCarpet5846
its up to you realistically your high school girlfriend doesnt last through college anyway so you can follow the normal path and break up once she leaves,MagicCarpet5846
or break up now,MagicCarpet5846
it takes people different times to know if they want to marry someone and marriage is a lifelong commitment he could very well be telling the truth that he isnt sure yet and he may be sure later he also could be hiding a reason he doesnt think he wants to marry you you can try to have a conversation about it he ultimately wont tell you if he doesnt want to i wouldnt ask if you already are fed up with waiting and its okay if after 3 years you want someone who is sure,MagicCarpet5846
i would personally decide if youre willing to wait for him to be sure or not if you arent everything else is irrelevant and its time to move on if youre willing to wait you need to decide how long youre willing to wait and then its time to sit down and talk to him ask him if theres some concern in his mind that he is keeping to himself if he says no just tell him plainly i understand it takes some people time and i understand marriage is a huge commitment i dont want us to get married unless both of us are sure but im going to be really upfront with you that if by x date next year 5th anniversary 30th birthday whatever line it is for you youre still no closer to being sure about us i cant wait any longer marriage is important to me and while i want it to happen with you im not going to wait around forever for you to feel the same way around me im not going to bring it up further so i dont pressure you into a decision one way or the other but i want to set clear expectations so neither of us are blindsided in the future,MagicCarpet5846
black white looks cheap and see through,MagicCarpet5846
it genuinely looks great if youre uncomfortable with the bottoms i would suggest a swim skirt as the flared skirt will really flatter your curves,MagicCarpet5846
he can talk to her and see what she wants to do like a rational adult find a compromise and see if maybe the fact that theyre on two different continents despite being married is causing her to feel pretty unconnected with him and shes fixating on the wedding as a symbol of their life together who knows but just because he cant give her a wedding doesnt mean he shouldnt talk to her,MagicCarpet5846
yep i mean im not saying everyone needs to get married but if you see marriage as something that could and should end at the drop of the hat dont get married then theres not really a ton of benefits to marriage anymore and any of them can easily be achieved with a contract that can be unilaterally terminated so if you dont see it as an actual serious commitment through good and bad times dont do it,MagicCarpet5846
it isnt an excuse though are you trying to tell me you think op did cheat because something was wrong with lauren because thats kinda bullshit too,MagicCarpet5846
you look amazing in this dress,MagicCarpet5846
you want to stay because you dont know anything different which is totally normal but youll find much better and be way happier,MagicCarpet5846
hes getting his phd still and clearly cant afford the wedding she wants so its highly unlikely hes got much to worry about,MagicCarpet5846
no they make you look incredibly blocky a low rise would look better,MagicCarpet5846
yeah actually they kinda are marriage rules lol thats the whole richer or poor better or worse health and unhealthy stuff you say when you get married,MagicCarpet5846
like i said if your rule is any time you do something i dont like im done dont get married seems pretty simple really if you dont see marriage as something worthy of doing the work to preserve dont do it its a lifelong commitment you want to be able to exit easily theres no reason someone needs to get married,MagicCarpet5846
once you marry someone youre kinda obligated to at least try to work through issues unless it involves cheating or abuse if you think you should just jump ship the moment someone saysdoes something you dont like you probably arent the type who should get married,MagicCarpet5846
sure it will get harder if they buy a house and have kids together but it isnt going to fundamentally change at this point if they sit down and have a conversation or go to a few therapy sessions first,MagicCarpet5846
theyre legally married it isnt exactly easy to just move on at this point,MagicCarpet5846
theyre already legally married lol abandon ship probably isnt the best advice they should at the very least have a conversation about expectations of lifestyle and maybe some counseling sessions,MagicCarpet5846
is this the same girl you just started dating like a month ago because dude cut your losses you were also dating someone else just two months before this girl maybe take some time alone you seem to be a serial monogamist,MagicCarpet5846
heres the two most likely outcomes you end things because you can see he isnt equipped to handle dating someone with your impairments or you dont end things and he inevitably gets frustrated and dumps you in a few weeksmonthsyears and then it hurts even more leaving now when its obvious you two arent a good match saves you the additional heartbreak that comes with being with someone even longer when things go south because at the heart of this is he simply doesnt have the patience to have a partner with an impairment like this,MagicCarpet5846
honestly i can see him being annoyed not many people like being constantly bumped into however that means he isnt right for you he cant handle his space being invaded while hes also stressed or irritated its okay but your discomfort is also 100 valid because even if it isnt coming from a place of violence it is coming from a place of i cannot handle what it means to date you and you deserve someone who can handle what it means to date you you two just arent right for each other,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846
see  for more info,MagicCarpet5846
people on here have some assbackwards high horse morals the people saying youre an ah are insane if you didnt buy it someone else would have sure you bought the bracelet because it gave you a bit of control over a situation where you dont have much but that doesnt make you an ah it makes you a 16 year old kid who has been tormented and oppressed by people who shouldve been family keep the bracelet say nothing when youve moved out and can objectively assess how you feel decide what you want to do if you miraculously repair your relationship you can always say you found a bracelet in a vintage shop and thought it looked familiar and wanted to give it to replace the previously lost bracelet but theres no benefit to telling them now that you have the bracelet,MagicCarpet5846
being petty to a racist who has tormented you for years by legally buying a bracelet that was legally sold to a pawn shop isnt an ah move,MagicCarpet5846
it isnt normal and yes you need to leave you have two children to take care of and this is no longer a safe environment for them its time to find a friend or even contact a church to find someone to stay with file for divorce and start dusting off the resume to find a job you can even look for jobs at day care or a play center if you cant affordfind child care,MagicCarpet5846
your husband has decided for whatever reason he no longer wants to adult fine no one likes to work but you do not should not and cannot stick around and let him put your children in danger understand youre a mom first and you need to act in their best interest right now and make sure theyre taken care of,MagicCarpet5846
i respect your opinions on pet care but youll need to respect my ability to make proper decisions about my own pet if you cant accept that we feel differently about this and dont think i should be allowed to interact with my pet as i see fit so long as im not causing bodily harm to her maybe this isnt going to work out we need to be able to respect differences of opinion and you cant expect me to just go along with everything you think i am my own person with my own beliefs just like you,MagicCarpet5846
nah her parents are right a useful degree will provide a statistically better life for their daughter than a passion degree like history you can be successful with a history degree but youre not successful because of the history degree a majority of the time ive looked up the jobs you can do with a history degree and most of them can use but wouldnt require the degree,MagicCarpet5846
i think it would be helpful to encourage niece to have a backup plan maybe minor in something she can use if she changes her mind or isnt finding success in history but its also nice of you to support her passions but life is just getting harder for people as time goes on and college degrees are getting less and less useful unless theyre in highly specialized fields spending a bunch of money on a passion degree without a strong plan for the future isnt really advisable unless you have family money to fall back on from an completely pragmatic perspective you can still study what you love while also pursuing a more stable and prosperous career,MagicCarpet5846
you should be extremely concerned because while this could absolutely be your fianc trying to do something nice and just totally fucking up this is absolutely how and when a lot of abusers show their colors,MagicCarpet5846
youre planning your wedding he thinks youre trapped and figured you wont leave he starts out small something thats a gift for you planning a honeymoon that will be a show of love hes using manipulative tactics to get you to agree and punishing you after you push back the punishment is the biggest red flag here,MagicCarpet5846
he may have always treated you amazingly but just keep in mind that no one who ends up in a toxic or otherwise abusive relationship started that way it started out great and then one day something small happened that changed things and they didnt notice and went along with the pressure because they felt like they were wrong as their perfect partner had never reacted this way before and then once theyre really and truly trapped the ugly truth shows itself,MagicCarpet5846
just be extremely careful and aware moving forward im not saying your fianc is an abuser but i am saying this is how it starts so watch out for any other red flags and do not back down seeing how he handles you firmly telling him no absolutely not and you better walk the fuck back from the you dont trust me language will tell you everything you need to know on if this is a marriage that is even safe to proceed with good luck be careful keep your eyes wide open,MagicCarpet5846
yeah im way more worried that this would set a precedent for do you trust me to be used as a manipulation tactic to get op to do things she doesnt want to do or isnt comfortable with in the future,MagicCarpet5846
yeah i meant it both ways the post says they have a date night once a month due to funds yet theyre both doing things separately multiple times a week but also he says they dont ever do expensive hoohar because he doesnt want to spend money in this climate which is valid dont go into debt but it doesnt sound like this is we have absolutely no money it sounds like im prioritizing saving money over facilitating a long lasting and deep foundation to my relationship and in that case its important to ask is a few extra hundred dollars in savings worth a clearly deteriorating relationship with your oh because if this rut is kicked off by the lack of experiences together which based on his comment to her seems like the case the few hundred dollars really might be the difference between her feeling happy and content in her relationship or feeling like he stopped trying to court her or to put effort into their romantic relationship as soon as they had a kid,MagicCarpet5846
i get wanting to save for your kid i do really but its definitely cheaper to have one household than two its cheaper to just take care of the relationship than pay for therapy once its on the brink of demise personally i am of the mentality that i would rather have my partner than a few extra hundred dollars and i also want to have these memories with my partner,MagicCarpet5846
lol classic redditor purposefully and completely missing my point no i dont but if you hear your partner saying they feel youre in a rut and dont do anything to change things and bring a spark back dont be surprised if they fall out of love sweet gestures are a really great way of making someone feel loved and guess what even a few hundred dollar dinners is way cheaper than marriage counseling will be if you do nothing until youre on the brink of divorce,MagicCarpet5846
its a fashion advice sub and just an fyi saying a cut isnt flattering to someones figure is not a comment on their figure its a comment on an article of clothing shes got a perfectly finereally nice figure its the dress that is puckering weirdly which may be resolved by ironing it like i suggested,MagicCarpet5846
take the overly offended attitude elsewhere,MagicCarpet5846
definitely iron it but the cut isnt very flattering on your figure it tapers in at the hips and emphasized your midsection,MagicCarpet5846
what the fuck why would you encourage him to make it work with a cheater the time for changes is done once cheating is involved its over the other person made their choice,MagicCarpet5846
of course sexual incompatibility is a good enough reason to break up youre 20 years old this is the time for you to go out have a bunch of sex figure out what you want in life and then hopefully find it and settle down in a few years or a decade or whatever if thats what you want,MagicCarpet5846
please do not stay in a relationship that you arent fully and 100 intensely satisfied in when youre so young it gets worse as you get older and stay with people longer its already wrong it will not become right by staying you should find a new place to stay once your lease is up and once youve signed a lease sit her down and explain to her you dont think the relationship is working long term and youre moving out at the end of the lease give her enough time to find a place but not so much time that it becomes super awkward to live together you should offer to sleep in the living room unless you have a 2 bd apartment but youre 20 so i highly doubt it and do not renew your lease even if you foolishly imo decide not to break up with her you should ask to move out,MagicCarpet5846
ill say it op handled this like shit and if he wants to stay with this woman until his daughter does move out he needs to hear his partner out ask her what shes missing what can add the spark back or offer some couples therapy,MagicCarpet5846
and we dont do that expensive hoohar sounds like a big part of the problem i often ask myself is saving a couple hundred dollars worth losing something else i really care about if the answer is no spend the money buy a beautiful bouquet of roses once a month take her out to a really expensive restaurant buy a little heart shaped necklace theres so many under 500 things you can do that are lavish and memorable and really show spontaneity and care,MagicCarpet5846
nta watching 4 children whos father is dying and 2 which you used to be a step father to is not a good idea if anything happens with these kids itll be on you from a liability standpoint watching 5 kids including a newborn is not a smart idea stand firm and hey even offer to take your son full time im sorry for whats happening with husband but i am unable to take your other kids i would be willing to take my son full time if that would make things easier for you to arrange child care for the other four but thats the extent im willing to go to help out i suggest you look into getting a baby sitter who can take them on short notice and i hope husband gets well soon,MagicCarpet5846
and fyi if you want more time with your son go petition the court to have full custody right now citing the cancer and frequent hospital stays as the reason explain it would be better for everyone involved if your ex didnt have to worry about another kid right now and if your son could have some stability and not be around such a heavydepressing topic,MagicCarpet5846
this also makes no sense like every single 28 year old male needs to be in a relationship i know plenty who are and have been single for years,MagicCarpet5846
nta you arent financially able to help them if this fund is the only money you have because it sounds like you live paycheck to paycheck youre unable to help them its not as though theres a few million in that account its likely a few tens of thousands or maybe low 6 figures which is nice sure but thats barely a down payment on a house nowadays being able to afford it financially means i can pay for everything i wantneed comfortably and still have tons of money left over that i will never even notice that is obviously not the case here,MagicCarpet5846
they seem to already be dragging it out op posted 3 months ago about not being ready to move and settle down with g and have kids and get engaged after 10 years together if youre not sure you want to marry someone after 10 years man you dont want to marry them and she clearly wants these things and yet despite everyone telling him to break up then he clearly didnt i hope op gets his head out of his ass because hes being incredibly selfish and destructive and potentially going to bring a very expensive life into this world that he clearly doesnt want with a woman that he clearly doesnt like and isnt committed to,MagicCarpet5846
i have a few questions,MagicCarpet5846
after 10 years together why arent you two married do either of you want marriage,MagicCarpet5846
do you even want to get over what she said this relationship sounds really wrong for both of you she said shes disgusted with your body thats not the sort of thing you forget,MagicCarpet5846
did you mean what you said when you insulted her intelligence is this because shes only interested in seemingly shallow hobbies like reality tv,MagicCarpet5846
do you want kids because if you dont want kids where you would find a woman who wants kids after you break up with g then do not have a child with g kids needs to be a two yesses decision and if its not a yes without the threat of a relationship dying over your head its not a yes at all,MagicCarpet5846
fairly certain if he were thinking with the penis instead of the brain he would be out fertility treatments are definitely the least sexy thing a person can do and most of the time you actually arent having much if any sex during them,MagicCarpet5846
well you can just say that straight up asking me to cut off my best friend because my bil knowing decided to date her is controlling and isolating and im not tolerating this if it were up to me i was never comfortable with them dating in the first place as that puts me in the middle way too much i told you very clearly i am not getting involved if you make cutting off my best friend for doing nothing wrong your hill to die on then we might as well start planning the funeral because i am not going to be pressured into playing this game relationships end he knew she was my best friend if he was unable to handle that fact he should not have dated her this is solely bils cross to bear they were together for 6 months and its clear he came off way too intensely and scared bf off so of course she didnt need very long to fully mourn their relationship i hope i am making myself perfectly clear that i find the implication i cut my best friend off incredibly toxic and if given the choice i am cutting off the toxic people in my life and right now that is not best friend,MagicCarpet5846
you are very very very obviously not over the rejection you need some serious therapy and get to the place where you can drop the rope youre running around trying to fix everyones problems at the cost of yourself because you are hoping this will finally make your blood family see you as important to them stop they dont they are using you because you consistently begged them to let you be used by them for validation,MagicCarpet5846
if zach doesnt want to care for his dad guess what your dad reaped what he sowed by neglecting his other kids do not take care of your father stop spending all of your money buying a ton of gifts it isnt getting the result you want they dont care about you they only tangentially care about everything youre giving them but if you take that away none of them will ever call you except for maybe rob,MagicCarpet5846
so please get some therapy and become okay with having a waaaay more distant relationship with your blood family they do not care about you and you jumping up and down throwing stuff at them is just telling them youre desperate for their attention and love and the more they dont give it to you the more they can take advantage of you with love and affection dangling like a carrot on a stick in front of you but they dont and never will stop doing so much for people who clearly will never return the favor,MagicCarpet5846
one potential way is to call the non emergency police line and tell them whats going on and ask if theres anyway a cop can come over and facilitate the discussion where you ask the photos to be deleted and also to have it on record as youll be dumping him afterwards and are afraid for your safety they may not do it but they also might make sure you mention this has all been done nonconsensually if you happen to know any police officers you can also ask if theyll do you a favor and do this as well in uniform,MagicCarpet5846
if youre able to get a cop to come make sure to delete the photos from his recently deleted photos and to also make sure theyre deleted from his icloud and then at the end of it make sure you ask the cop to put this on record so if somehow he managed to keep any photos if he ever distributes them itll be a very clear case of revenge porn as he is the only one with these photos and was told by a police officer to delete them,MagicCarpet5846
nta this is like someone calling you an ah for calling the police because you were stabbed this is why hoas exist youre not an ah for calling the correct people you didnt call the hoa because the color of their house was the wrong shade of white you called because they were causing both property damage and psychological damage by keeping you up at night,MagicCarpet5846
and just as an fyi theres almost no way that a 25 bouncy castle was legal either you couldve likely called the police too as you need permits and safety people for something that large and its usually not allowed in residential areas period a family friend does the carnivals in my area and the larger slides etc were all kiiiiinda illegal but they relied on the its only for 4 hours so no one will really care or know mentality,MagicCarpet5846
your husband is right its time to completely cut all three of them off,MagicCarpet5846
sure but that doesnt happen in engineering literally the definition in most states is make more than 600week and be in a job where an advanced degree is required this isnt some weird field engineering is pretty universally known to be exempt stop trying to make this something it isnt shes exempt she needs to decide what she wants and if shes cut out for a field where what shes being offered is as good as it will ever realistically get im done having this conversation if you dont believe me do a quick google search this is like the most easily verifiable information about labor laws out there,MagicCarpet5846
bruh read the fucking post she is exempt she has clearly stated it stop trying to argue about something that is literally stated in the post as true its coming off as extremely argumentative take the antiwork attitude to the antiwork subreddit,MagicCarpet5846
its 50 hours not 60 she started 3 months ago and this is her first job,MagicCarpet5846
i can assure you in this instance no its almost 100 not a good career move to leave now if she can do a year that would be the least likely to impact her career and would be a good use of job hopping personally most of the recruiters i know want at least 2 years but 1 at least a year they will still interview a really good candidate and will definitely ask why the short tenure no company wants to employ a brand new professional train them only for them to leave a few months or a year later its just not worth it for them,MagicCarpet5846
and again the company isnt taking advantage of her theyre paying her they are legally not required to pay her you do understand this right this is what the field entails theyre giving her more than most employers woulddo if she genuinely cant handle this reality shes simply not cut out to do engineering like i said you cant be a cpa and say you wont work overtime during tax season its just not how it works you come off as someone who thinks things should work how you want and dont actually understand how the professional world actually operates,MagicCarpet5846
its not iffy im very familiar with the laws for engineers theyre exempt no overtime required and op has very explicitly stated this same thing in the post this is how it is for engineers unless you do consulting work,MagicCarpet5846
honestly if op is a woman she should go through ivf and simply tell her partner if you dont want kids then we need to end things but this is nonnegotiable for me and im proceeding with it,MagicCarpet5846
i recognize this is a terrible idea in reality but if shes a woman she should take autonomy over her own desire to have children and make it happen,MagicCarpet5846
lmao youre aware op is 30 and would be instantly snapped up by another wonderful woman right its not as though his wife is his only chance at love sure hell have no wife for a few years while he gets to know someone else but hes young has a great job and wants a family hes a ton of womens dream man right there as long as he takes care of himself and knows how to wash a dish the idea that if he ends things hed be alone is almost as absurd as the people who imply a womans only worth is to procreate,MagicCarpet5846
op is exempt they legally are not required to pay her anything and this is an issue shed find in most any company in the electrics engineering field she needs to be very realistic about what she wants her career path to be moving forward and take this info into consideration because shes definitely exempt and while a company that pays time and a half probably does exist it may not be easy to find and get a job there especially if she leaves her first job so soon shes only 23 and paying your dues is definitely necessary sometimes,MagicCarpet5846
yeah exactly but op is an electrical engineer and an exempt employee depending on if shes a software vs a hardware side of ee she could just need to accept the nature of the job you work until a project is finisheda deadline is met in these fields a lot of the time you get paid well for it but sometimes thats just the cost of the business ya know my partner was a software engineer and some weeks were really chill and other weeks when something was due or there was an issue theyd be working 1618 hour days every day for a few weeks made good money but thats just the nature of the industry make sure you can handle it before pursuing a career in that field,MagicCarpet5846
lmao op needs to recognize getting paid for her time is more than shes legally entitled to then and be happy,MagicCarpet5846
sure but im also just stating that if shes in a salaried professional position she most likely legally is not entitled to overtime pay and in fact is getting more than the legally required payment she needs to do research absolutely but a number of people dont realize that a lot of occupations that make good money also arent entitled to any overtime pay now that doesnt mean every single occupation but thats the whole look it up be aware you may not be entitled to what youre asking disclaimer i was giving,MagicCarpet5846
you definitely can i think you think im saying an employer can take someone from an hourly to salaried employee at will to avoid overtime but thats not what im saying im saying a company can choose to employee people either as a salary or hourly employee in a number of professional positions where in an hourly structure they would need to pay per hour worked but as a salaried employee it would be a flat rate regardless of if you worked 40 or 50 hours and yes legally this varies by state so its important to know your states labor laws and its also important to ask the right questions and set clear expectations when accepting a position on hours expected overtime etc but its 1000000 an employers decision to hire people on either an hourly or salaried basis and then depending on the local laws whether particular positions are entitled to overtime or not,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you can definitely decide what you want but depending on your field that just isnt an option youll have theres plenty of industries where if youre unwilling to do what needs to be done to get a project done on time you wont survive in that industry for instance you cant be a cpa and tell your firm that you are only going to work 40 hour weeks during tax season and expect to keep your job you cant tell the hospital that youre not going to help out with a massive outbreak or accident or whatever it may be because youve worked 40 hours that week if that isnt for you totally fair just be realistic when choosing a career path then,MagicCarpet5846
dont get taken advantage of but also people do sometimes take it too far for the principle of things without understanding it just isnt how it works in some fields,MagicCarpet5846
everyone handles trauma differently but i have never heard of anyone man or woman to take selfies of themselves doing things to their rapist and looking happy while doing it that sounds like he cheated on you and thinks youre dumb enough to believe his story,MagicCarpet5846
its unfortunate because op is only 23 and she just started it can definitely look poorly on her to already be searching for a new job,MagicCarpet5846
well you absolutely can and many do make employees salaried so as not to pay ot but thats on the employee to carefully weigh job expectations and compensation packages before accepting a position,MagicCarpet5846
it depends on the state laws in california salaried professionals arent entitled to overtime pay doesnt matter if youre an entry level or management level individual employers can do whatever they want but legally they dont have to pay anything if youre a salaried professional employee,MagicCarpet5846
that actually isnt how it works in the professional world usually a number of states labor laws explicitly state professionalsalaried employees arent entitled to any overtime pay as in not even just normal time but 0 for any extra hours worked you usually are getting compensated well if youre in a position that might require overtime think if you work as a cpa or a surgeon but its important to understand laws and payment structures vary and theres definitely a lot of professions and jobs where you may be required to work overtime for your job description but you are not legally entitled to compensation for it this isnt true in most hourly positions and lower skilled jobs like retail workers but yeah just be aware of the labor laws in your state,MagicCarpet5846
yeah cant say telling the rest of her kids they cant go have fun at a water park with their cousins because their sister thinks shes fat is a good way to help her body image issues knowing kidssiblings they just might use that against the daughter in the future,MagicCarpet5846
i think youre going to drive yourself nuts trying to understand this its simple he wants a partner who is close to their family you are not close to your blood family he thought maybe he could accept it and hes realizing after 3 years he cannot thats the only thing you need to understand and now its time to respect it and more importantly start respecting yourself and stop trying to make it work with someone who doesnt want to make it work,MagicCarpet5846
no i cant i am not him youd need to ask him i can only give you perspective on he is allowed to have any dealbreaker he wants and he isnt wrong for having them i could guess maybe if he doesnt have a close relationship hes always wanted one and thus wants a partner who does have that big happy family but youd need to ask him,MagicCarpet5846
well in asking him to be flexible you are asking him not to care about what he cares about and in him asking you to consider forgiving your abusive family he isnt respecting your boundaries either but thats the thing he cares about this regardless of if you think its a valid thing to care about and theres no fixing the fact that this is his hill to die on make your hill to die on finding a partner who treats your chosen family just as well as he treats his own,MagicCarpet5846
you cant ask me because im not him i dont really care about family and in fact prefer a partner who isnt very close to family my whole point is just because you disagree with what he finds important doesnt make it unimportant thats why we date to find someone who were compatible with,MagicCarpet5846
if this is all true you need to come to terms with the fact that you cant give him what he wants and stop torturing yourself you dont deserve staying in a relationship with someone youre clearly on such wildly different pages you will find someone much better suited to you who treats you way better just like a close relationship with family may be his dealbreaker you should make wants me to forgive my family a dealbreaker for you,MagicCarpet5846
no im not missing that you see them as your family and i think thats great but he is very clearly meaning family as in blood family and in that regard you dont have that your family is chosen but he very specifically wants the family lineage not just friends and thats okay too i am a person who thinks family means very little but even in my own perspective i am able to recognize that i do not get to tell others what they should and shouldnt think about family and thats something i think you need to recognize as well,MagicCarpet5846
for you they are your family for him theyre your friends not your family and he wants someone who has a close relationship with their family which is where they incompatibilities come into play both in your definitions of family and the relationships he expects of them,MagicCarpet5846
and i understand that but chosen family and the family you grew up with and raised you arent the same for him thats something you need to respect just as much as youuu need someone who respects and is fine with you have a chosen family and not a blood family thats an incompatibility though thats not one person being right or wrong you may be really hurt and youre 100000 valid in your story he is the wrong one and i get that but from an objective vantage point neither of you are the villains you just want different lives and neither of you can give the other what you each deserve,MagicCarpet5846
no they arent thats him communicating his doubts people talk about things they think are incompatibilities all the time he has never suggested she forgive her family hes only communicating about he doesnt know if he can accept them not being in her life i have had dozens of conversations over the years when dating with people like this it was never pressure it was im struggling with this and am talking to my partner about it rather than blindsiding you i would always take someone telling me im reconsidering our relationship because of xyz over just ending things for seemingly no reason,MagicCarpet5846
3 years in op needs to realize he obviously isnt going to accept it and hes obviously never treated her very seriously because deep down he knows he cant start a life with her but he isnt pressuring her him communicating his feelings shouldnt be villianized,MagicCarpet5846
it isnt wrong it would be wrong of him to say you need to forgive your family and be close to them for you and i to stay together but it is not wrong for him to say you arent close with your family and thats really important to me and regardless of if you have a really good reason i dont see a future with someone who isnt close to their family trying to change someone is wrong wanting something different from someone no matter what it is isnt wrong,MagicCarpet5846
based on your post he isnt trying to change you hes just saying you two are incompatible and he isnt wrong for that no one is the easy example to understand is disagreeing on kids completely unacceptable behavior i want kids and even though you dont im not accepting that answer and will force you to have kids with me completely acceptable behavior i want kids and even though you have really good reasons for not wanting them this isnt something i can compromise on i think its better we find people we are both more compatible with,MagicCarpet5846
in both cases everything else in the relationship can be fine but having a big close family is very integral to the life your boyfriend wants and realistically he isnt alone in that this isnt some foreign cult like desire is everyone you meet going to care no absolutely not but plenty of people choose their partner based on if they can have the life they want with them or not and thats about everything kids pets financial goals retirement anything and everything you can think of someone out there finds that thing really important to them and will absolutely break up with any partner that doesnt align well with them in that regard,MagicCarpet5846
so please stop calling him wrongunreasonable for having his own vision of his life hes entitled to that just like you are entitled to not keep toxic people in your life just like you may not want to date someone in the future who is extremely close to their family these are all things we can and frankly should consider while dating if you wouldnt truly be happy making a life with someone are you saying you should still stay because you should be happy with them no of course not,MagicCarpet5846
but its not the appearance if it were hed be pressuring op to forgive her family he isnt hes saying he doesnt think they have a future he doesnt want the appearance of family he wants the actual close family why is everyone purposefully misunderstanding that,MagicCarpet5846
i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt,MagicCarpet5846
now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a strong relationship with their family,MagicCarpet5846
i actually dont see anywhere where he says op should have a relationship with her family hes simply saying regardless of if its for a good reason i dont want to marry someone who doesnt have a good relationship with their family which is fundamentally different hes saying op and him will not work because she doesnt have a relationship with her family and he isnt going to change the future he wants because op has a good reason but guess what thats totally his right and theres nothing wrong there it sucks but people dont need to accept anything about you and hes allowed to want any future he does and he isnt wrong for finding someone who aligns with that op doesnt,MagicCarpet5846
now op sounds wayyyyyy better off without this guy in her life as well but he isnt wrong for wanting a partner who has a village,MagicCarpet5846
it happens all the time though if he wanted kids and you didnt that would similarly be throwing away your relationship for people he doesnt know yet people have ideas of the futures that they want and are allowed to find a partner who meshes well with that future he shouldnt have to compromise on wanting a future where he and his wife can have all the in laws over for a bbq or whatever and you shouldnt have to compromise on not allowing harmful relationships in your life,MagicCarpet5846
i understand it hurts but your bf isnt in the wrong here either if hes just saying you two arent compatible and he isnt insisting you mend your relationship with your family,MagicCarpet5846
it honestly doesnt it just sounds like he knew they would never work out long term and so he never took the relationship very seriously,MagicCarpet5846
heres the thing though it actually isnt an easy thing to work out its a dealbreaker for him to not have a close relationship with both his and his partners family unless youre telling me its easy because youll go and have a relationship with your family please dont then there isnt an easy fix at all youre at an impasse as much as you would be if he wanted kids and you didnt,MagicCarpet5846
telling someone you shouldnt care about the thing you care about is not an appropriate way of working things out and its totally reasonable for him to want a partner that everyone can have this big huge family where everyone gets along its absolutely heartbreaking for you as i understand how much it hurts to be judged for reasons outside of your control but its 100 reasonable for someone to consider their partners family when deciding to marry someone i personally wouldnt marry someone with an exceptionally toxic family that they hadnt cut out everyone has different lines unfortunately for him his line is i want my partner to have a good and close relationship with her family and regardless of if you think thats reasonable he is fully entitled to that dealbreaker and you need to recognize that youre simply unable to provide that for him much like if you didnt want kids you could never give him a son,MagicCarpet5846
im sorry for this but it sounds like he isnt that great of a boyfriend anyway and youd be much happier finding someone who accepts you your past and is happy with just your friends,MagicCarpet5846
this is not the proper takeaway,MagicCarpet5846
yta dont give expensive gifts if it has strings attached yes expecting a hand written thank you note is a string i guarantee you none of them give a shit about a 300 pen,MagicCarpet5846
i dont really think its healthy to imply a 21 year old should made huge decisions on their life trajectory based on a teenage sweetheart when i was that age my parents drilled into my head make the decisions you want to make for your future never consider your partner if its meant to be it will be and if it isnt meant to be then you havent changed your life for someone you arent meant to be with and thats 100 accurate at 21 implying hes somehow wrong for moving and following his life path because his girlfriend is elsewhere is shockingly naive and obtuse,MagicCarpet5846
you uh you know exaggerating is just a roundabout way of saying im a liar and everyone already knows me as a liar so shockingly they thought i was continuing to lie because it made a good story,MagicCarpet5846
in all fairness its stupid to assume everyone is an exception to the most logical conclusion,MagicCarpet5846
how about he goes with a family member or friend instead he wants to go and has already put the deposit down if he goes with someone else itll only be 5k total and then it wont be a waste and you wont need to fee terrible on your own vacation then he can go and find someone to go with him,MagicCarpet5846
yeah i think overanalyzing the nuance of is this just a 23 year old male who is uncomfortable with heavy topics and using humor to break the tensions vs is this person a covert abuser waiting to happen isnt worth it whatever the answer is its perfectly clear that this guy isnt giving op what she needs to feel heard and to feel safe and at that point trying to figure out the exact motives and reasoning behind the action just distract from dealing with the action itself and dealing with it should just be washing her hands of the relationship and leaving,MagicCarpet5846
very normal also very normal and necessary for op to step in to explain the behavior while normal is unacceptable its how we learn and grow into hopefully functional adults,MagicCarpet5846
info how old are you because its pretty clear youre at most 23 and have no actual understanding or experience with teenagers and young adult males who think once they turn 18 they no longer need to follow rules the only thing being left out is people with actual life experience and knowledge of what teenagers are like weighing in everyone here saying theres something being left out no way an 18 year old would just be an ah for no reason have no idea that all those times you thought you were justified in your anger at 18 nah just an ah dont worry you usually grow out of it,MagicCarpet5846
yeah im genuinely so over this trend of theres clearly more to the story youre not telling me on posts like okay buuuut maybe just comment on whats in the postcomments instead,MagicCarpet5846
what exactly is the timeline here because im confused why youre posting now this sounds like something you found out a long time ago,MagicCarpet5846
a lot of people on here are very biased against men and also seem to think reasonable compromise in a relationship is a read flag which is simultaneously shocking and also not given how immature a lot of people on reddit seem to be,MagicCarpet5846
work comes first but this wasnt a choice of working or gaming it was a choice of only working or getting to do both how do you come to the conclusion that he needs to let her work using his equipment rather than her just working on her laptop in the kitchen or bedroom anyone who works from home and has a laptop has used their laptop as a portable computer for work thats the whole point shes just unwilling to compromise or suffer the least bit of inconvenience,MagicCarpet5846
nta maybe it was as hard for your parents as it was for you it wasnt but lets just say maybe they put themselves in that position you had no choice in the matter why on earth would you subject your child to that same lack of autonomy over their situation,MagicCarpet5846
do not get a pet if youre so weak willed to rehome them at the behest of a partner simply because they want you to these are living creatures not toys you can just shuffle around as is convenient,MagicCarpet5846
just tell them straight up yes im absolutely leaving him for a better lifestyle i deserve way more than a cheating distant husband this has nothing to do with money and everything to do with me knowing my worth if stbx thinks thats abandonment then what does he think he has done all this time hes been stepping out on our marriage,MagicCarpet5846
theres nothing to indicate that theres no mention if op wanted to live with her father no mention of if he paid child support and no mention of if she asked and was turned down to moving in with her father with the absence of any of that information it can only be concluded that she moved out because she wanted to allow her mother to downsize at 18 not because she was kicked out and her step sister never did because they simply live different lives its also not his kid he doesnt have unilateral decision making on kicking out the step sister obviously at 31 hes okay with it but lets not act like her actual birth mother whose home it also is doesnt have a say in allowing her daughter to live there,MagicCarpet5846
yeah yta you shouldnt resent your father or your step sister for having more than you do you really want to be a 31 year old still living at home if youre still harboring issues over this more than a decade later its time for professional intervention it isnt normal and its hurting your own well being to be resentful over someone having something you didnt have thief is the comparison of joy and you and your step sibling are different with different experiences,MagicCarpet5846
why didnt you spend any time with your father did he pay child support did you ever ask to move in with him maybe if he said no to you moving in with him after turning 18 i could understand some amount of resentment but at some point you shouldnt resent a 31 year old who still lives at home without any indication of your father very pointedly and directly telling you he wouldnt give you further assistancewouldnt allow you to move in with him you have no basis to resent him and need to understand that your situations are both different and it is also her mothers home and her mother likely has a large say in allowing your step sister to stay in the home for so long,MagicCarpet5846
the road to hell is paved with good intentions,MagicCarpet5846
just because you didnt intend to hurt her does not change the fact that you did hurt her stop acting as though not meaning to means you didnt hurt her you hurt her start from that fact and figure out how to make up for it if its even possible,MagicCarpet5846
seems like in trying to demand everything youll end up with nothing,MagicCarpet5846
so its a sin for you to live with the person youre going to marry but not for him to live with someone hes been dating a quarter of the time,MagicCarpet5846
that math doesnt add up,MagicCarpet5846
ill also point out something when you discovered what her job was she had already started an only fans and the content was out there forever if her current partners have an issue with her career in the present tense she can quit now and this will no longer be an issue if the issue is she ever was a sex worker though no matter what you did in that moment at 18 she still would have been a sex worker for most people its a binary issue have you ever done  and regardless of if youd managed to get her to stop that day at 18 the answer would still be the same yes so your supporting her career choice or not supporting it wouldve had no impact on future relationship especially if she has since quit because what she will tell future partners is the same now as it wouldve been then when i was younger i did some sex work i did it for xyz reasons i regret it and im no longer doing it but i want to be upfront so if thats a problem for you we dont waste our time,MagicCarpet5846
theres a difference between telling someone not to cook ever and saying dont do something you know youre terrible at as a present for your husbands birthday you really have to know that theyre not the same right,MagicCarpet5846
if she wants to do that have it be a random tuesday or idk practice until she can make something edible its not really the thought that counts if the thought it im not going to put any effort into getting good at this before giving you something i know youll hate but expect you to pretend to love it anyway,MagicCarpet5846
he hardly did it intentionally its the same situation where someone seeing cant wait to have you inside me again on their partners phone when cleaning up the bedroom isnt snooping if they look at the text chain to discover an affair,MagicCarpet5846
i mean it nicely but he didnt snoop you knew he was in the room and you were within earshot if there was a breaklull in whatever he was listening to unless he has professional audio equipment most headphones are far from 100 noise cancelling he heard you talking about him and curiosity got the better of him thats just like when a woman sees an inappropriate text pop up on their partners phone and opens it to find them cheating theyre not snooping or invading privacy in that case and unfortunately i dont think he was invading your privacy here,MagicCarpet5846
this is sorta a situation of what did you expect would happen if you were talking about your partner in a less than ideal way with him within earshot this happens all the time where one person talks smack thinking someone isnt within earshot and then they are the added context of being in a therapy session really doesnt change the lack of betrayal here if anything hes likely feeling quite betrayed have you discussed any of these issues with him or is this the first time hes hearing you might have some doubtsbe afraid of incompatibilities,MagicCarpet5846
im not trying to make you feel badly we need therapy and safe outlets to work through our feelingsvent but if youre unable to do a session aloneaway from someone you know you really shouldnt mention them i cant reasonably say a 24 year old dude who tried not to hear and then heard you talking about him unfavorably was betraying your privacy by listening in for 2 minutes and then deciding not to and to just talk to you about it instead relationships require communication and this does sound like a fair point of discussion in a relationship,MagicCarpet5846
having kids is a privilege not a right and its something that honestly with how overpopulated most of the world is most people shouldnt have kids they already had 3 there is no need for them to have had a 4th or 5th kid seems like a lot of people are acting like having as many kids as they want is a right and it simply is not,MagicCarpet5846
eh i think its pretty callous to suggest theyre only having kids because they want to fuck over op they probably do want these kids plenty of people always dreamed of a large family and i understand it can be frustrating to have a great job and still struggle to afford the basics but thats their reality and many others reality they need to make the decision to have kids based on their current situation and also based on if they can afford it should anything change,MagicCarpet5846
just like op should probably have a full time job because if her ex lost his job tomorrow shed either no longer get child support or get a significantly reduced amount if her current income isnt enough to at least mostly pay for expenses thats probably not ideal everyone needs to live within their means not the means of others,MagicCarpet5846
idk if this is true everywhere or even anywhere but i thought that child custodychild support court cases are typically where possible handled by the same judge because it prevents finding a judge to rule how you want and also because it ensures someone at least somewhat familiar with the details of youyour case will be able to make more consistent ruling as life situations change,MagicCarpet5846
and if it happens that op doesnt have enough income for her expenses shell need to figure it out but theres a good chance child support wont end until 21,MagicCarpet5846
idk i would tell my boyfriend about being groomed and her husband everything shes ever done and not told him and id add blackmailing her own sister on to that list,MagicCarpet5846
yeah if everyone is just going to make up a narrative under the assumption the op must not be telling the truth then theres no point to this sub anyway just make a judgement based on the actual information given even if you personally dont think thats all the info,MagicCarpet5846
oooor they really do just hate jim because they see it as a replacement for their father i mean to some extent we need to take op at face value shes the only person who was actually there if theres missing information then obviously any advice here wouldnt work regardless,MagicCarpet5846
if the kids are happy with their dad thats all that matters but i will challenge you that depending on the circumstance cheating on a parent absolutely can impact your ability to be a good fathermother my parents both know very clearly that if either cheated on the other even if its the parent i dont really like getting cheated on i will not forgive the offender and they would be dead to me and im definitely not a rare case,MagicCarpet5846
but what your wife is doing is not the way if the kids are happy to be with their dad thats all that matters cheating doesnt have to impact your ability to be a good parent but i just want to point out it 100 can,MagicCarpet5846
yeah its extremely hard to say they very well may have had that conversation so i dont want to absolve this man of accountability buuuuut ive seen a number of men and women post on here about issues that arise because they assume theyre in an official relationship when the other person doesnt agree i can easily see this being a similar situation where he expected it to be maybe a week or so and now a few months in hes decided hes just not feeling it anymore and theres no real commitment so hes just letting it fade out,MagicCarpet5846
i mean he did break up with you tell him he can pick either you broke up with me and i didnt cheat on you so drop it or you didnt break up with me in which case i am breaking up with you now because i sure as hell am not staying with someone who thinks its at all acceptable to ghost their girlfriend for 3 months which is it because im not doing this bullshit i didnt cheat on you and if you think i really did cheat on you then this relationship is done,MagicCarpet5846
and make him pick once he picks dont let him unpick and frankly i would leave anyway because this asshat actually thinks its okay to ghost someone for 3 months with no consequences fuck that i would brea up with someone who didnt answer for 48 hours and i have im not exaggerating here with no warning or explanation let alone 3 months,MagicCarpet5846
honestly the selfish bit is just not communicating about it though i honestly suspect theres a chance they arent actually bfgf and this is another case of assuming what they are rather than having the explicit conversation if so he isnt even really a jerk for just slow fading and losing interest if im wrong and they did explicitly say we are boyfriendgirlfriend and in a committed relationship then he is selfish for failing to communicate the relationship no longer working for him but outside of that its no surprise he doesnt want to invest a ton of time getting to know someone who he cant even really get to know seeing as they really dont get to see each other much,MagicCarpet5846
yeah or could have just said i didnt have patience back then to put up with teaching and didnt want to give you a bad learning experience it was because i wasnt a good teacher to you not because you were a bad student,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think you can fix this she doesnt love you anymore and she doesnt seem to be attracted to you either you cant make someone love you and you cant make someone want to work on things it sounds like she ended up with you because you saved her and then once she was finally back on her feet the love wasnt there enough to survive all the misfortune in your post,MagicCarpet5846
your post has an almost unbelievable series of bad events in it if this really did all happen in the past two years its honestly no surprise she no longer loves you losing your money your jobs depression leaving her alone in a pregnancy being so unwilling to help clean your house developed a fungal infection and even more acts of bad luck would probably kill most marriages that young,MagicCarpet5846
i get it hurts but youre both 24 you were married for only a year before she decided she wanted a divorce it sounds like she recognizes shes still young and would be happier in a different relationship and frankly i agree with her you would both be better off divorcing and you working on yourself and focusing on being the best father you can be and then making sure youre in a place where you can handle a relationship again,MagicCarpet5846
good luck but you need to start mourning the relationship and give your wife a divorce if thats what she wants i would tell her if you want a divorce you need to be the one to take steps and file because i want to work this out but i also recognize i cant make you stay,MagicCarpet5846
its definitely normal when a man 10 years older than you and richer than you is trying to take you on luxury vacations 4 months in yes,MagicCarpet5846
theres a saying be with a man for money you earn every cent im not saying you were with him for money but i am trying to illustrate that men who provide their partners with lots of moneyfinancial supportluxury experiences do often expect exactly what your boyfriend did they think money should be enough to earn them an obedient and supportive gf,MagicCarpet5846
now i firmly disagree and its clear you two arent compatible with one another both of you should be glad you found out early but beware in your next relationship that older rich men typically arent paying for their younger girlfriend to go on crazy vacations right after meeting out of the goodness of their heart sometimes they do this isnt an all men statement but it is something that happens and if you dont want it to happen id stick to men closer in age to you and be more firm about equal contributions financially in the relationship so there isnt anything to try to use as leverage against you,MagicCarpet5846
you can love and be a good parent to your son without being this much of a doormat to your wife divorce her and go for split custody,MagicCarpet5846
dating at 30 isnt much different than dating in your 20s however dating at 40 50 and so on after that long with one person is definitely not ideal so use that info to stand strong in ending things now and moving on end it move out if you live together and just block her if she tries to convince you shes just asking for permission to cheat and that is ridiculous she thinks she can brow beat you into agreeing to that,MagicCarpet5846
i mean its been two weeks and youre 20 he honestly owes you nothing now do i believe he really forgot no not really dude isnt worth your time based on that alone but in a straight up hook up situation i dont really see it as reasonable to expect them to read your mind you clearly wanted him to come with you but that isnt what you said and you are expecting him to care about your wellbeing and honestly handle a potential pregnancy with more care than most peoples actual committed boyfriends would,MagicCarpet5846
if you dont like this reality dont have unprotected sex with guys you arent in a relationship with otherwise its not really fair to be upset that they arent handling things the way you think they should it sucks for sure and this guy isnt anyone id want to have sex with but i dont see where this is anything out of the normal for a 20 year old male hooking up with someone for a couple of weeks,MagicCarpet5846
i mean id love to be a billionaire too that doesnt mean its going to happen if you dont trust someone drunk or sober they probably arent someone you shouldnt date,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846
see  for more info,MagicCarpet5846
it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically,MagicCarpet5846
you know how all the waaay older men with young women say shes the one who heavily perused me ok but you also agreed so,MagicCarpet5846
it is weird and creepy just keep to im not interested in younger men romantically,MagicCarpet5846
i will mention this could very easily be a rule put in place to explicitly exclude your kids without outright saying it just be prepared in that case to graciously now out from attending and say you wont be able to make it dont turn things into a fight theres likely a reason they are making the wedding difficult to attend and its likely so they can have excuses not to include those they dont really want to be there,MagicCarpet5846
i wouldnt bring it up the conversation isnt going to make you feel better you know how he really feels about you hes either going to lie to your face and beg for forgiveness or even worse he isnt going to deny any of it and will confirm this is how he really feels about you regardless of what he says youre going to feel like shit instead leave with your head held high instead bright side you dont live together and havent merged lives i get its scary to start over but its better to move on at 31 and find that person than have to start over at 41 after youve given him another 10 years to tear down your self esteem,MagicCarpet5846
i mean yeah actually i have when youre in that level of crisis you can make some big strides does that mean everything is totally fine after 11 days no definitely not but you can definitely make enough progress in a few sessions to at a minimum know you both want to and are willing to work on things i doubt they went to 2 sessions and stopped for good it sounds like hes just giving an update on we are working things out and therapy has been helpful which isnt at all unbelievable,MagicCarpet5846
yes i understood that but im saying youd be surprised just how quickly someone who is now free to do something can suddenly have all sorts of outings lined up she may not as well but im saying dont stay because youre afraid she cant socialize well she clearly can if she wants to,MagicCarpet5846
did you do the right thing about what exactly she broke up with you for being an alcoholic you are a 28 year old dating a 21 year old no i dont really think you did the right thing and i think she tried to encourage you to be a better person but you can only change if you want to change and so i hope you want to and are able to change because at least at the beginning of your relationship you sounded like a creepy alcoholic dude who went out with someone really young and are surprised they actually have some standards granted her age is showing by not completely blocking you and moving on but its no surprise a 21 year old doesnt think an older alcoholic is really who she wants to spend time with,MagicCarpet5846
she wants to keep being your friend because bullying you makes her feel good about herself youre the undesirable one of the two of you if you cut her off of course shes going to be upset because if someone like you doesnt even like her what does that say about her,MagicCarpet5846
now im speaking in her perspective you sound lovely and way too patient here but its clear she only keeps you around because tearing you down and you tolerating it makes her feel that much bigger and better about herself,MagicCarpet5846
yes you should absolutely cut her off i would simply tell her the next time she says anything even mildly passive aggressive ive tried hard not to say anything because at one point our friendship meant a lot to me but im done being your punching bag and am done with our friendship i dont want to talk to you anymore and i hope you learn to treat your friends a lot better than youve treated me,MagicCarpet5846
and then block her just block her dont even wait for the reply tell your parents before sending the message so they dont let her in and make sure they support you in this block her on all socials if you think she might be really petty maybe wait for a reply for her to say some nasty shit to you screenshot it for ammo if she spreads rumors about you and then blockmute her,MagicCarpet5846
at the end of the day thats really all you can do you cant fix her you can only try to make sure someone who cares about her will try to look out for her,MagicCarpet5846
and idk man seems like her socializing well is the problem here so shell probably be more fine than you realize once she actually is allowed to do as she pleases once shes single,MagicCarpet5846
exactly and i am sorry that you will need to go through this discomfort if youre able to just remember that it will be better in time and lead to better things,MagicCarpet5846
nah being concerned about your kids safety is never something i will call someone an ah for much like a similar post the only people who i think are maybe ah is the neighbors who spread around the info that this person was responsible but theyre also allowed to be upset that their kids are losing out on a sweet tradition ultimately if she brings it up again i would just say i heard your concerns about your childs safety and i would never put a parent in an uncomfortable position regarding something so serious that being said it isnt up to me to decide how other parents are going to feel about their own children losing out on a tradition that the neighborhood has always really enjoyed if you change your mind and understand this isnt about luring kids into anything other than a joy of curiosity and exploration of nature im happy to continue but im not going to get involved in others being unhappy with you for this were all adults and can manage our own relationships,MagicCarpet5846
her friends are fine too just someone you trust who will look out for her if they see her getting worse you arent trying to fix her youre just looking to tell someone youve noticed some things that are concerning and you want them to know in case they see it too so someone can be there for her dont even ask them to get her help just tell them to be on the lookout for any signs,MagicCarpet5846
hey i totally get it when i was your age i thought that relationship would be my one and only it felt so amazing and like all my prayers were answered and then we grew up and who we were was no longer who we are and it was no longer right i learned so much though and you have too dont lose those principles your grandfather taught you just because something doesnt work out doesnt mean that the idea isnt good life just has other plans sometimes but youll find that person maybe next week and maybe next year or the next decade but youll find them and itll be worth it just remember that the heartbreak will be necessary to find that relationship youre meant to be in,MagicCarpet5846
yeah this is definitely a case where having only one side of the story means any advice other than talk about it is probably not great he says he feels like shes prioritizing this friend over him but she may feel like he doesnt like when she does anything without him its really impossible to know which person is being reasonable or if maybe theyre both being reasonable but they simply arent compatible,MagicCarpet5846
regardless of the answer i still maintain showing up when explicitly told not to come is never the answer unless youre looking to end the relationship,MagicCarpet5846
i would personally reach out to her family instead of her if shes genuinely suffering from mental health issues that are undiagnosed shes unlikely to be equipped to address them if youre close to anyone in her life id just reach out to them right after you end things and say youve ended it for reasons you dont want to get into but you still care for her and want whats best for her and think shes been showing some signs of some mental issues that you dont want to go unaddressed if they persistworsen,MagicCarpet5846
and thats a 100 understandable reaction personally i think there is a reason most relationships at 18 dont last anyway i know losing a relationship thats lasted this long is still painful but you deserve and will find someone who will not betray your trust like this i wish you well it will hurt but know that good will come from this pain,MagicCarpet5846
on the one hand i think its pretty difficult to be fully committed to someone for life at 18 on the other hand if she couldnt be satisfied in her relationship just with you she shouldve broken up with you i think you need to ask yourself if you could move on and have a life with someone who did this to you do people change yeah but that doesnt mean she has yet and it doesnt mean just because shes said sorry you need to accept,MagicCarpet5846
i honestly probably wouldnt do this they need to talk and resolve the issue if i were the girlfriend in that situation id feel like my boyfriend was jealous and controlling and couldnt let me have a trip by myself im not saying thats what op would be doing at all but that is definitely how i would feel if i told my boyfriend i wanted to do this trip alone with a friend and he explicitly went behind my back to be in the same city at the same time,MagicCarpet5846
i mean just cut contact and tell her before you will discuss anything with her you want to submit a blood paternity test through the lab of your choosing without that retain a good lawyer in preparation for her to sue for child support do not contact her in anything other than writing and do not respond to anything unless its an agreement to take a paternity test,MagicCarpet5846
but also no offense if you did get her pregnant you deserve the consequences as unprotected sex with a friend youre not attracted to and you know has mental health issues is just plain stupid youre too old to be acting like that,MagicCarpet5846
i mean would you rather be that girl or the girl who was so afraid of looking like that girl that she allowed her boyfriend to blatantly disrespect her and cheat on her for the entirety of their relationship instead because honestly its way worse to be the second one than the first at least that girl has a shred of selfrespect but right now youre acting like you dont even like yourself,MagicCarpet5846
idk i wouldnt be able to look at her the same if she didnt give you the money what is a marriage if your word to your partner means nothing,MagicCarpet5846
if youre already over her what 2448 hours later yeah it was definitely the right call,MagicCarpet5846
he was on mushrooms thats pretty par for the course with drugs of that nature its rather silly to try to diagnose someone on heavily mind altering substances with a serious mental illness from a reddit post that being said sober or high he doesnt sound like a life partner and if thats what op is looking for shed be best served moving on,MagicCarpet5846
that wasnt in the post though i did see the comment you mentioned op has fertility issues and will likely need fertility treatments to conceive definitely still a risk but not quite the same risk as would be those otherwise healthy having unprotected sex which for a reference is only about 30 i kiiinda see what youre saying but given most pregnancies in the us are actually unplanned im not fully sure that doesnt add up if anything it totally checks out to me lol it seems to me that bf loves op a lot and wants to spend forever with her on an emotional level hence being okay if they did conceive but as of right now isnt willing to completely and legally tie himself to her until he knows theyre on the same page,MagicCarpet5846
child support for someone youve never married vs someone you are married to own a home with etc are definitely two very different worst case scenario financial situations if im taking all emotion out of the situation since im sure youre thinking if hes willing to have a child with her why not be willing to marry her and while i definitely personally agree with that thought process know plenty of people who dont,MagicCarpet5846
well he was with his ex since they were at the oldest 15 it isnt really that surprising they didnt get married as they were likely around 2324 when they broke up i understand 10 years sounds like a lot but once you actually consider the majority of their relationship if not all of it comprised of middlehigh schoolcollege its not really a factor,MagicCarpet5846
and we definitely have enough info from ops biased perspective to see why someone wouldnt want to marry her just yet you can love someone like crazy and still be able to recognize that someone with terrible credit poor spending habits and payday loans all things op readily admits to isnt someone to marry right away marriage is both an emotional and a logical decision and it definitely sounds like the logical part of the decision has entirely valid reasons to want to wait and make sure this isnt a disaster waiting to happen as differences in finances are the number one reason couples divorce,MagicCarpet5846
just remember your ability to get an appointment and others experiences arent going to be the same this occurred during lockdown when everything was done online so options werent limited by location and zoom therapy opened up a lot of options for people that werent previously available for example ive never had to wait longer than 2 weeks for an appointment ive needed new patient or old therapy or any other doctor but that doesnt mean i would tell anyone else they didnt try hard enough if they werent able to find an appointment as quickly,MagicCarpet5846
if your only reason for doubting the veracity of this story is the idea that someone was able to get a therapy appointment quickly and hire someone during a time where plenty of people werent able to work due to the lockdowns id urge you to remember your experiences wont be the same as everyone elses,MagicCarpet5846
oooor its really obvious op was way too immature for marriage until very recently and he isnt readywilling to make a huge and lifelong commitment to someone who only recently had poor credit and payday loans,MagicCarpet5846
why does it always need to be the guy is lying to op about wanting to get married and bullshitting her with his super valid concerns about proceeding,MagicCarpet5846
i mean your relationship isnt serious hes said as much if hes already planning who hes going to fuck when you break up he clearly isnt very committed or interested in you if hes already prepared for how hell get over your breakup and which friends hell find comfort inside literally break up with him and you probably need to break up with that friend as well because i dont know how shitty of a person someone needs to be to sleep with their friend of 4 years fwb at a minimum pseudo boyfriend more accurately thats a pure trash move from both parties and most 2223 year olds will know better than to behave like this men and women,MagicCarpet5846
i mean now youve learned how your husband will treat your kid ifwhen you divorce him and he finds some other younger woman to start a family with,MagicCarpet5846
red flag if ever i saw one,MagicCarpet5846
at that point just leave otherwise its just an attention seeking endeavor please notice me withdrawing rather than organically just matching the energy it wouldnt be noticeable otherwise and then youre brought back to my initial comment easier said than done when you live together and if youre at the point of needing to be petty to be heard the relationship clearly isnt working,MagicCarpet5846
you moved and said no one you know is in your area how is your ex a genuine concern he wouldnt know where you live,MagicCarpet5846
well you have no idea what shes in therapy for this is clearly either an obvious crush on bil and a bs sexist ploy to get close to himhave an affair or genuine anxiety but that doesnt mean that either have been adequately brought up in therapy you can be in therapy for things and not be in therapy for everything or even the right things,MagicCarpet5846
sounds like she looked up the wine and saw the price for a case not a bottle as a case of 12 is around 200 and figured you wouldnt know the difference,MagicCarpet5846
ok well neither of you sound grown up enough to get married,MagicCarpet5846
thats probably much easier if you dont live and have pets together like op at that point its pretty difficult to pull back in any meaningful way without being seen as really petty,MagicCarpet5846
you can be upset your girlfriend went to a con topless thats a pretty standard boundary for most people but you dont say you feel she crossed a line by being topless youre upset because she embarrassed you because you dont like how her body looks after beating cancer and thats what makes you ta,MagicCarpet5846
its a small company there likely is not hr,MagicCarpet5846
ok but i very much doubt she was overcompensating for the past 45 years this has likely been an issue for at least a few years no,MagicCarpet5846
talking about this issue is the start but if you guys arent able to actively resolve these issues within the next 3 months i would cancel the wedding i would accelerate that timeline depending on whenif you need to cancel by a certain date to get refunds on whatever you can,MagicCarpet5846
chances are you arent able to resolve these issues you would be extremely foolish to push forward into a marriage where resentment is already blooming because even canceling an expensive wedding will be much cheaper than a divorce,MagicCarpet5846
the fact that its taken you 5 years to even begin to question such a glaring and obvious incompatibility is mind numbing to me,MagicCarpet5846
this isnt fixable she isnt going to suddenly going to start wanting sex as much as you do youre signing up for a lifetime of disappointment which seems unwise,MagicCarpet5846
yeah im really not surprised that attraction is at the core of this im sorry to kick you while youre down but in the absence of kids or seriously debilitating health issues there are honestly few people out there who wont start to lose attraction for such a massive change in appearance before marriage somehow everyone on reddit claims to be that minority and im sure most people wouldnt say anything but attraction and effort is also very important to a long lasting relationship and you will find that like i said there are plenty of people out there who really dont care and will find you beautiful at any weight or type of clothing its now just time to find them  good luck,MagicCarpet5846
to be honest i do not understand this your brothers 30th milestone birthday is the same night and you wanted to go as a couple and obviously were planning to attend so how did this conversation of am i invited and ill get a sitter even happen,MagicCarpet5846
how was the conversation not it is my brothers birthday that same night you are either attending with me or youre staying and watching the children but going to a 21st birthday of a friend isnt an option like i just dont get how you didnt bring up your brothers birthday and how you were just ready to ditch your brothers birthday if you were invited to this persons 21st,MagicCarpet5846
yeah and its foolish to think that will never happen because of course as soon as you bank your life on that wont happen it does without fail,MagicCarpet5846
sadly doesnt seem like he cares about losing op too much as he left the house even after noelle told him to get lost and didnt deny it or try to work things out all things considered though op is better off with him not fighting because at least shell be able to leave much sooner and with much less pomp and circumstance,MagicCarpet5846
uhm whoever that they is is an idiot because it isnt true alcohol isnt a truth serum it just lowers your inhibitions and sometimes those inhibitions are all thats stopping people from saying something absolutely wildly untrue but just pops into their head and sound goodfunnyshocking,MagicCarpet5846
a 45 lb weight gain in less than 2 years as an otherwise healthy assuming here since nothing to indicate otherwise 20 something year old is definitely really concerning honestly reddit hates to address it but that would definitely put a strain on attraction for most people the other obvious issues aside that being said not everyone and you deserve a partner who is attracted to you as you are now and loves you and wouldnt leave you even if someone better came along,MagicCarpet5846
idek if this is about him being insecure so much as about him wanting to be able to do better than op and the reality is things change in peoples lives all the time that open up previously unavailable dating options people get rich start to take skin care or fitness or eating healthy more seriously all the time health issues or fixes can completely change a person promotion at work lottery win inheritance or an investment that pays off some insecure 23 year old with daddy issues comes along,MagicCarpet5846
as soon as that happens op is getting dumped immediately and remorselessly,MagicCarpet5846
it isnt about her its about him he pretty outright told you if a woman like her were interested in me i wouldnt be with you i would be with her he might love you but ifwhen a woman in her league likes him hell be the type who cant resist you really want to be one of those my husband left me when i was pregnant with our second child for a woman 10 years younger than me stories because he is the man who leaves his wife for a woman 10 years younger than him because he never thought hed have a chance with the hot young woman and now that he does hes willing to blow up his life for the chance,MagicCarpet5846
he can nuke this relationship with his friend to the ground and it doesnt matter because she isnt the woman who will give him a chance but someone someday probably will and if you cant trust your partner to turn down any woman young old hot rich smart poor stupid etc why are you with them,MagicCarpet5846
you love who you thought he was not who he is are you telling me you think so little of yourself to fall in love with someone whom you know is only with you because he thinks he cant do any better he thinks youre fat thinks you cant cook and thinks hes also poor and not worth a better woman thats not what i look for in a dream man honesty,MagicCarpet5846
do you regret having your son because this definitely sounds like you regret having your son and cant genuinely fathom someone wanting to be a parent as a 1 goal in life remember people can want different things and if you keep up this attitude your son is going to realize you clearly regret becoming a mother,MagicCarpet5846
probably because he loves his wife and also because regardless of how unhappy you are not many people want to be the guy who divorced his wife after she beat cancer youd be surprised by how much guilt probably made him stay as long as he did,MagicCarpet5846
a marriage is more than sex but a marriage is not more than any form of intimacy with absolutely no form of intimacy and affection you arent married youre just legal roommates why have all of the liability for none of the benefits that isnt a partner at that point,MagicCarpet5846
it isnt just sex its all form of love and intimacy how can you expect a marriage to last if youre unwillingunable to do any of the things that actually make a marriage a marriage they arent kissing cuddling pleasing each other or even hugging each other no back massages or showers together or any form of intimacy she isnt willing to go to therapy with him and has made it clear she expects this to be permanent she has made her choice and its a choice anyone would respect but just because you respect someones choice doesnt mean you need to accept it,MagicCarpet5846
her choice affects him as well and hes allowed to decide that thats not the life he signed up for stop acting as those refusing all forms of intimacy and affection and being unwilling to work on or compromise about it is just about sex,MagicCarpet5846
i mean does she need to be worried about it because its a choice to remove all intimacy and romance from a marriage and thats a choice that was made separate from the lack of libido if you remove everything that makes a marriage unique from a friendshiproommate its unreasonable to expect someone to want to continue being in that marriage,MagicCarpet5846
if ops wife wants op to stick around in a marriage with no intimacy at all thats very different from libido issues and a lack of piv,MagicCarpet5846
i think you should just say this at this point it isnt about the cake its about you 1 saying you would do something repeatedly and then not following through 2 you not being able to handle being called out on not staying true to your word and 3 the fact that you can see clearly now that it is that important and youve shown no remorse or sense of accountability and havent even apologized or tried to make it up to me this isnt the kind of person i want to be with im glad i found this out only 10 months in at least,MagicCarpet5846
because really this isnt the kind of person you want to be with,MagicCarpet5846
while thats fair enough they definitely do upgrade only one person on the same reservation when its free upgrades had it happen a number of times to me,MagicCarpet5846
theres a substantial difference between giving someone on your locator number an upgrade and a stranger though,MagicCarpet5846
i get it but yeah relationships that go through so many bumps honestly arent stronger yes you need to be able to work through issues but relationships that constantly have bumps are just rocky and eventually someone is going to decide they dont want to deal with the rockiness forever i think a lot of people in rocky and unstable relationships think theyre stronger because well weve always worked though things before but i think most people outside of the relationship can see the opposite is really true because people just dont want to constantly be trying to work things out with someone as nauseam forever,MagicCarpet5846
if youre constantly fighting with someone even small spats but especially bigger spats that almost always means that relationship isnt right at least not without something major changing,MagicCarpet5846
i think the sad thing is people like that actually are often really loyal to the person they actually want and end up getting left by those people leading to them being in general super disrespectful of others time,MagicCarpet5846
honestly i wouldnt even say that i would just say i realized i dont see this being a long term thing and dont want either of our time to be wasted so its best we part ways now rather than later,MagicCarpet5846
why would you admit to knowing some pretty messed up info just say you dont feel it anymore and make her think its because of her not because of op not being enough for her,MagicCarpet5846
nta just sit your parents down and say i am feeling like i dont matter as much to you as ana is this true let them answer once they do say every year you treat me like a second class citizen giving me a 10 minute meal i dont even really love to celebrate and giving everyone else the ability to choose whatever they want on their birthday i am willing to compromise and give ana our actual birthday but do you really think thats fair because im only 16 and i realize how blatantly unfair that is can we please as a family sit down and can you please listen to me expressing myself and come to a compromise listen for their answer if their answer isnt yes of course just say this i love you which is why im being really honest with this if you guys arent able to recognize the blatant favoritism and disrespect thats going on dont be surprised if in a few years our relationship looks very different if you guys arent willing to show all of your children the same love in the same ways thats going to really damage our relationship and im not saying this as a bratty teenager im saying this as your hurt daughter who doesnt want to believe that her parents would be so calloused to not realize that a 16 year old still needs the same love and joy around her birthday even if she has a younger sister i didnt stop existing when ana was born,MagicCarpet5846
just be mature about it dont yell or throw a tantrum and remember youll be 18 in a few years and can decide how much this truly affects the relationship with your parents then,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think one month is the standard either,MagicCarpet5846
i know this is hard to hear but i dont think this is as quick a switch up as youre making it out to be sounds like there were a lot of issues throughout your relationship and a lot of incompatibilities thats not really a sudden problem its a bit misleading and naive to tell yourself this is sudden because even in your post i can tell this was a long time coming as a stranger and i didnt live this relationship you may benefit from being honest about the past 4 years to learn the signs of a doomed relationship because i bet upon reflection they will be there,MagicCarpet5846
tbh its very possible they got notice and disregarded itmissed it i know i dont read a lot of mail that looks like junk,MagicCarpet5846
i mean just remember people really do find out about their cheating spouse this way,MagicCarpet5846
i think it really depends on where you are and how diligent you are a lot of times i think people are unfamiliar with how to find people to call which results in everyone calling the top few results and leading to insane wait times and inevitably people give up after a number of we have an appointment x months away but ive never had an issue getting an appointment when i needed one it was only ever a question of how many doctors would i need to call to get one im sure everyones experience is different though but there are definitely more resources available than a lot of people realize unfortunately,MagicCarpet5846
so you arent saying she needs to include sil but the issue is you also arent saying she doesnt need to include her and frankly i do not want my wife to include someone who so deliberately excluded her from their own wedding,MagicCarpet5846
inaction is action here you think just because you arent saying to include her youre in the clear but you arent you need to tell your family she doesnt and shouldnt include her understand the difference,MagicCarpet5846
ok and to be fair you know your fiance did feel excluded you couldve spoken about it to the brother you are very very close to but you didnt so yes it is your not our your bad for for communicating this at the time two years ago and now lisa will learn actions have consequences even if those actions are somewhat reasonable,MagicCarpet5846
just explain to anyone who asks if you didnt feel comfortable having my wife in your wedding party you cant expect her to feel comfortable having you in hers just like we respected your decision to choose who to include in your wedding party and your wedding photos you need to respect our decision this isnt up for discussion anymore i am not going to allow my wife to feel uncomfortable about anything surrounding the happiest day of our lives are we clear,MagicCarpet5846
time to be a big boy and stand up for your wife and your marriage if you dont this is the sort of pattern that rots a marriage inside out take notes,MagicCarpet5846
its the current standard of care for fractious cats in vet med easier said than done really shouldnt apply to doing your job properly not only that but its pretty simple to have the vet just place the towel over the cats body that the tech can then secure with the bits of his armtorso that are available sure if there was one person doing this you might have a point but not with two sets of hands available,MagicCarpet5846
there are definitely way better restraint methods that are meant to be used for fractious cats like this for example placing a towel over the cats face which will help to calm the cat and also prevent the cat from reading back to bite like that,MagicCarpet5846
you mean building a successful team doesnt happen overnight they actually gasp need time to bring everything together and dominate,MagicCarpet5846
im shocked s,MagicCarpet5846
heads up if youre actually a doctor you need to be smart enough to tell the difference your wife has a genuine problem with the frequency and amount of your drinking if youre unwillingunable to have a serious conversation about your alcohol consumption while youre both sober you probably arent making it to too many more anniversary celebrations shes getting fed up this isnt her humor this is her genuine annoyance and frustration you would be an utter fool not to see this for what it is and address your pretty clear problem,MagicCarpet5846
men your age are not getting wasted every friday unless theyre alcoholics,MagicCarpet5846
i mean definitely depends it wouldnt surprise me if op is an alcoholic i had another beer because thats just what i do on a friday night despite being visibly drunk already sounds like binge drinking and it sounds like something his wife isnt okay with and probably even had a conversation with him about please dont embarrass me at our anniversary or whatever wording it was asking him not to get so drunk and shes annoyed as shes been putting up with it for so long,MagicCarpet5846
can confirm from experience anyone who says it wont affect things and says itll still be a friendship trip is lying the only reason it wont affect ops trip is because the friend and her boyfriend will never be around which in and of itself completely ruins the point of the trip unless op wanted to be alone the whole time very much not worth and ruined the friendship i will add,MagicCarpet5846
yeah this is a reminder that unless you get some mega asshole people arent going to be commenting on this sort of thing its all about if youre comfortable enough to have that part of your body be seen,MagicCarpet5846
ignore her if you really want a clear message sent block her account if ever you need to say anything just say i have no interest in being friends with someone like you i have way more respect for myself than to keep someone in my life who would purposefully flirt with my boyfriend in front of me just to prove a point that says a lot and everything that it says is appalling stop contacting me,MagicCarpet5846
yes but they also pretty commonly get it when they themselves arent clean enough and bacteria from their butt gets into too close contact with their vagina during sex any uti you get using a condom is likely due to your own hygiene rather than the covered condom it definitely isnt just men who can have poor hygiene and its important to recognize that maybe they are both in need of a good scrub for the others comfort its never easy to bring up concerns so he may have a legitimate concern as well that he didnt know how to tactfully bring up,MagicCarpet5846
they canshould both be taking showers before sex,MagicCarpet5846
yeah but im sure you immediately saw his reaction and apologized clearly that did not happen here,MagicCarpet5846
then you wouldnt be saying teehee idk when your partner asks what youll do you say i took it so hed leave me alone but ill delete it when were home,MagicCarpet5846
lmao look she can absolutely have a hotwifecuck fetish and if her partner is on board like her ex obviously was thats totally cool im not shaming two individuals who have fully consented to whatever in their relationship but no you arent jealous for having a problem with your girlfriend saying i dont know what shes going to do about the dude who wants to fuck her and shes playing along with it thats like her trying to say youre jealous for being mad she has another dude inside of her there are some pretty well established boundaries within monogamous relationships that while its always best to discuss anyway are go without saying rules and expectations not entertaining dudes who very clearly want to get in your pants is pretty bare min,MagicCarpet5846
your girl has something wrong with her if she genuinely doesnt see how without express consent from you playing this behavior that its just not okay,MagicCarpet5846
usavevideo,MagicCarpet5846
i would honestly just say your attitude is atrocious if i waited for you you can wait for me it was a few minutes im extremely disappointed in you for trying to turn something good in my life about yourself we need to talk about this because im absolutely not going to tolerate this sort of behavior but i think its best we both take some space from each other to collect our thoughts so we can hopefully have a productive conversation about this because right now im having a hard time seeing how to move forward in a relationship with someone who cant be happy when something good happens,MagicCarpet5846
because this is either a habit of hers or this is the first time its happened and either way you need to make it crystal clear that if she thinks this is okay you two arent compatible why would you willingly stay with someone who would burst your bubble like this over seven fucking minutes ive literally taken shits that last longer,MagicCarpet5846
did he actually not have sex with someone for 7 years im honestly doubtful of that because if it took him a few months to ask you to be exclusive you were presumably having sex while not in a relationship a guy who goes 7 years without sex doesnt really do things that way,MagicCarpet5846
i dont know if youre taking didnt date anyone for 7 years to be the same as didnt have sex or see anyone at all for 7 years because they arent quite the same now obviously if he explicitly said the words youre the first person ive slept with since my ex 7 years ago then ofc,MagicCarpet5846
also to op she feels the love has started growing since nov to him it didnt even start until they made things official which was only a few months it takes people awhile to fall in love sometimes especially if its been 7 years since he last was i assume he wasnt celibate during that time so it lends itself to the idea of he isnt one to fall in love easily or quickly,MagicCarpet5846
op if youre offended i think you need to look inward and assess you say i love you because you want someone to feel good not because you want the emotional validation of hearing it back,MagicCarpet5846
well because believe it or not it actually doesnt solve the problem to say omg wow he suuuuucks if we want to be high school girls gossiping in the lunch room well focus on the negative behavior but if youre actually trying to problem solve you focus less on the actions of the past and more on the actions to do in the future to address the behavior and in order the address it op needs to communicate how shes feeling,MagicCarpet5846
well its not really a family vacation she specifically said to him i want to see this city and i want you to spend time with your teacher that can very reasonably be interpreted as two separate vacations that are going on at the same time with obvious time spent together but this isnt the same thing as a family vacation where the only intent is to have fun together as a family op wants to see the city and in trying to make that happen explicitly told her husband she wanted him to be able to spend time and hang out with a friend mind you this is the first time theyve ever met and its presumably in a country that speaks the language husband has been learning its completely understandable how meeting a friend for the first time you can get lost in the time and being exposed to a culture for the first time and being able to apply everything youve been working hard to learn could also just be so new and exciting for ops husband,MagicCarpet5846
now is it right what hes doing no hes married to a mother and he needs to understand that there are certain limitations with that but this isnt a family vacation in the traditional sense and so its very easy to see how husband doesnt understand op would have a problem with him hanging out with his friend when he was explicitly told the purpose of the trip was so he could do so so communication is key and no not some condescending communication like thats some fucking ridiculous concept actual adult communication,MagicCarpet5846
i have a feeling the fact that its not his daughter is playing a role he rather obviously doesnt really consider himself a father and while i dont think he should have to he also is married to a mother and with that comes an understanding of there will be natural changes and limitations to what you can do on vacation,MagicCarpet5846
going out past 10 pm only to go out again at 3 am and not be back till after 7 am is definitely one of those things you really cant do,MagicCarpet5846
yeah the longer she waits the more likely its completely over i dont see how a relationship recovers after this much time dead in the water honestly  i had a friendship end pretty similarly and i was open to repairing it for like a few weeks and after they didnt reach out i was over it when they finally did reach out i just ignored it,MagicCarpet5846
honestly given its been a few weeks since theyve spoken allie may not be keeping op in her life either if op wants to save that friendship she needs to reach out and apologize and ask how she can best support allie and respect her boundaries while doing so because if she doesnt reach out the relationship with allie is done for,MagicCarpet5846
are you telling me that youre happy now,MagicCarpet5846
idk everyone says that but they either dont know the people around them or just have a selection bias because if you are honest enough and live long enough you realize that like i said 95 of the population says catty things to their close confidants and humans as a whole really are not immune from having crappy thoughts its incredibly naive of people who claim not meeee must be you,MagicCarpet5846
hell i can look at most peoples comment histories and see plenty of catty comments the only difference is being able to at least acknowledge it,MagicCarpet5846
gently prodding for more details like the people asking for each of their exact salary i gotta say i side with him on that one hes asking for advice about a particular situation and attitude,MagicCarpet5846
i mean he said slightly and its negligible at that point if you think negligible is 2x nothing then you also just think nothing op is saying is reliable in which case advice is pointless some people arent comfortable sharing specific details on the internet for anonymity,MagicCarpet5846
imagine being so hungry for info on strangers you block someone for calling out how weird it is,MagicCarpet5846
uhuh thats what everyone says its like someone saying they dont owe in the shower its more likely theyre lyingin denial about it than they dont actually pee in the shower,MagicCarpet5846
most people dont realize just how catty private conversations really are to an outsider,MagicCarpet5846
just tell her youll cover this month if she covers next and if she puts up a fight just say if you dont see the issue in your attitude we need to have a more serious conversation about our relationship in general because its not okay for you to expect me to cover the burden of your mistakes without so much as having a conversation or asking me about it im not okay being with someone who thinks thats okay regardless of if this is over 30 or way more,MagicCarpet5846
dude stop asking about ops personal salary info,MagicCarpet5846
i think the issue is she said im not paying this month because i already made my budget kinda hard assed imo but i guess and im not paying extra the month after either shes basically saying you need to pay for my fuck up and im not accepting any other answer over 5 or 5k or 50k that sort of attitude is really bad for any relationship,MagicCarpet5846
well you also said youve only been dating a few months youd be surprised at how well people are at hiding their true nature for months and even years at a time but now youve seen a side to her and while its possible she means what she said to you more likely than not she just doesnt like confrontation and is spinning things to sound nicer to you now that you called her out either she is going to dump you or youre going to dump her but theres very little chance this person is your person im sorry i know it sucks to find out someone isnt who you thought they are,MagicCarpet5846
no offense as well but its also really naive to think 95 of people dont have a mean side in some regard people are not known for being saints if you had to show strangers your worst private conversation with your closest friends and families we would all think every single person in this thread is vain judgmental and shallow,MagicCarpet5846
i mean the whole point of the post was centered around a superficial perception of worth not surprising he would only bring up the direct comparisons that are relevant not only that but if he actually spent half the post talking about all the reasons he likes her outside of on paper youd be saying hes overcompensating and shes not really that great,MagicCarpet5846
i think if you described your partner to a complete and utter stranger most would say similar things youre not going to go on about he gives the best head ive ever had youll say things like hes smart funny handsome etc,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846

yes you can you can hide your name from the leaderboard and pull your account from the third party trackers,MagicCarpet5846
unless this happened yesterday this person was clearly able to easily find an ob that didnt ask so it cant really be standard practice or else everyone would have asked her,MagicCarpet5846
yeah dont expect this person to be your friend moving forward i cant imagine ever wanting someone who suggested getting rid of the baby i really wanted in my life just because they thought it was too soon,MagicCarpet5846
that isnt fair at all she seems to just want an equal and thats going to be near impossible with someone 15 years older than her,MagicCarpet5846
are you actually shocked she was unhappy or are you just shocked she would actually leave because the fact that youre shocked is the problem she told you what she needed and you ignored her if youre genuinely so emotionally stunted that you can have all that information and still be shocked that shows just how terrible of a partner you are every time you say im just so shocked makes you look that much worse thats like someone seeing a lit fire and then saying theyre shocked when it burns someone that dumb probably shows it in other ways as well and for you the issues definitely showed in other ways so be honest are you actually shocked or are you just shocked she would actually leave,MagicCarpet5846
nta but most likely theres a background there and you hit a nerve you didnt know about let it go im sure it doesnt really have anything to do with you i will say i think it is a bit personal after knowing someone less than 4 months to be effectively asking about if they had an indepth conversation about marriage or if it was a surprise i can understand how that might strike a nerve with some people im sure you meant it pretty innocently though so youre not really an ah for that i say nta since if she does have a nerve to strike probably shouldnt be sharing things at work but to each their own,MagicCarpet5846
you are just making crap up now they met at a mutual hobby youre aware that it is genuinely possible to just get on with someone right like holy hell are you deluded to act as though someone has to yes i am aware they often do but to act as though thats the only option is insane seek out some young woman and it isnt genuinely possible for two adults to meet and hit it off and for age not to come up until later believe it or not in the adult world you dont often say hi how are you my name is blank and i am xx years old how about you oh sorry youre too old for me to talk to they didnt meet on a dating app they met in the real world over shared interests its mind numbing to me someone can be so bigoted to just blindly ignore all other possibilities because yes often age gaps are bad do you think other stereotypes are okay to blindly follow too heads up they arent,MagicCarpet5846
the only dodgy behavior here is yours because im not the one arguing to blindly judge a person and their intentions based solely on their age not only that but youre infantilizing a fucking 28 year old soon to be nurse do you have any idea how disrespectful that is to women in general just ludicrous,MagicCarpet5846
just reply i bought the ticket for my date that was meant to be you but clearly you had other plans so i found a new date,MagicCarpet5846
i think ultimately you just need to stop caring why are you walking on eggshells you are legally 100 within your rights to do what youre doing he cant complain about the noise youre making youre legally allowed to use your apartment even with reasonable disruption to others most landlords cant actually make rules like no cookingusing laundry machine after 10 pm because that infringes on your legal right to use your space youre paying for so just stop caring so what if he bangs not your problem youre not doing anything wrong tune him out keep your door locked if you need to report anything simply say to the landlord in writing the neighbor below me has been banging on the walls at all hours of the day in response to my normal living habits i am not making any excessive noise and have taken every precaution to minimize my disruption to neighbors to what is reasonable while still allowing me to live in the space im paying for i know i am not doing anything wrong here so i am alerting you of the issue in case this escalated further and in case youre able to speak with neighbor to understand that apartment building arent always completely silent and im legally entitled to walk to the bathroom if i wake up and need to pee but other than that stop caring,MagicCarpet5846
girl real talk if you think two years of being miserable and being 28 before you can even start to find a real partner is worth less than 3k you need some therapy,MagicCarpet5846
this is so worth 3k that id even say its worth going into credit card debt over but obviously if you can take a loan from family a nolow interest balance transfer find a cheaper place etc etc etc do that first but genuinely your mental health and happiness is worth so much more than 3k and if youre already paying 70 of the rent find a cheaper place and the money youll save from only needed to care for one adult will more than make up for it,MagicCarpet5846
nta this isnt the standard my cousin doesnt respect my serious relationship that is longer than hes been dating his fiance you always see where id probably say your gf would be valid in feeling hurt you left her behind as thats a direct insult to your relationship but he is famous and presumably if he never gets privacy somewhat significantly famous where paparazzi may be trying to snoop your girlfriend only wanting to come because of the experience famous person cool wedding is exactly the kind of person your cousin is trying to avoid attending his wedding no offense to your girlfriend i get how she feels but your cousin is allowed to want privacy in one of the most intimate milestones in his life and making sure only close friends and immediateactual family is the best way to ensure that,MagicCarpet5846
nta sepsis has a 2050 mortality rate that then increases by something like 57 every hour you go without treatment its quite frankly one of the worst medical outcomes you can have short from a horrifyingly traumatic injury and some ultra aggressive cancers your bil either hates your brother or is a massive idiot because chances are better than not that your brother isnt fine and if he is itll be its own little miracle given he probably was ignoring the symptoms for a bit of time if he thought it was just a bad virus,MagicCarpet5846
that isnt a lie even in a court of law learn how the english language works better because those statements are 100 accurate and would hold up to any intelligent scrutiny im done with this conversation now bye bye,MagicCarpet5846
no it isnt its not a lie to not give everyone a play by play reenactment of every decision youve ever made its not even a half truth its just a truth op saw her on sm and figured theyd get along whether or not you agree its definitely because they have mutual friends that op came to that conclusion op would not have felt that way if it were just a complete and total stranger who happened to live in the same city and again definitely a small world because lets do this with actual strangers if i rolled up in la and decided i liked random influencer i could swipe for months and never find them that statement is plain and simple truth,MagicCarpet5846
remember no one is entitled to every single thought youve ever had in the name of integrity thats foolish have a good day now,MagicCarpet5846
youre contradicting yourself youre essentially saying if it ever comes up she should continue to lie about not knowing they had mutual friends rather than saying i was a little embarrassed because i figured you had no idea who i was if she asks about it rather than being technically 100 truthful if you advocate transparency then thered be nothing wrong with this as it would technically be clearing up the only actual lie op has told,MagicCarpet5846
i certainly would never bring it up but youd be surprised how many stupid conversations couples who are newly in love will have its better to have a thought out way to frame things than just word vomiting because youre flustered and caught off guard and coming off like the next joe,MagicCarpet5846
its not a lie there is no mention of the temporality of those events and to some extent that is a large part of why op figured theyd like her personality sm is a shit reflection of who a person really is but the fact that they had mutual friends lent a lot of credence to the conclusions op was making and it is a small world or else ops plan would not have worked,MagicCarpet5846
sure its carefully curating the truth to give the best perspective on the situation but theres no lie so theres no concern of breach of integrity i purposefully avoided any language that would indicate a temporal correlation between seeing her on sm and matching on the dating app to make sure that there wasnt any lies,MagicCarpet5846
yes for everyone out there an esa is a pet that is legally effectively all they are the only luxuries having an esa allows you is having them in nopet housing and being able to fly with them on some airlines and you need extensive paperwork outside of those two very specific and limited instances theyre no different than any other dog out there they can be forbidden from public spaces and do not have any other protections they arent working and thus the whole do not pet a working dog doesnt apply it is a crime to claim an esa is a service animal by the way two very different legal definitions,MagicCarpet5846
now you should always use caution when petting a dog you dont know as you dont know if the dog will bite but at that point thats fully the fault of the owner for not restraining their pet in public,MagicCarpet5846
sometimes its all in how you package things we matched and i realized id seen you in friends socials and i figured hey if they fuck with you maybe i would too and here we are crazy how its such a small world huh sounds way better than before you even knew i existed i decided wed be a good couple so i downloaded all the apps because that makes my intentions the most clear and just swiped until i found you and hoped for the best easy really now that i think about it doesnt it,MagicCarpet5846
the only thing i would ever admit to is i had seen you on sm before and seeing you on whatever app made me want to shoot my shot small world huh and if she ever pressed just say nah i never thought about sliding into your dms but i saw a cute girl who i knew my friends fucked with and figured hey if they fuck with you i might too and here we are,MagicCarpet5846
makes it waaaaaay less stalkery than what your post implies,MagicCarpet5846
best of luck just remember you and him vs the problem hes committed to being a team to figure this out you guys got this,MagicCarpet5846
there is the fourth issue of you two are also incompatible for other reasons at some point you may need to accept you two are two puzzle pieces from completely different sets that you keep trying to force together that were just never meant to you dont seem to have a lot of the necessary fundamentals for a long lasting relationship and then on top of it theres issues of trust and intimacy building up with it theres only so much good communication can fix and you may need to take a good hard look and see how much of these issues are just who you each are and how you two dont work together,MagicCarpet5846
that honestly means that while the road ahead will be tough and filled with work you two will likely figure this out try to hold onto that hope while you two are navigating the road ahead it may get worse before it gets better because both of you two are clearly on wholly other planets right now but he wants to try and you want to try both of you are willing to genuinely give therapy a try and communication can almost always be improved with hard work and honest selfreflection in some ways you two have already overcome the hardest obstacle deciding to make it work,MagicCarpet5846
yike im not trying to normalize it no but i am trying to say dont make a judgment strictly about a persons age when if you eliminated the age their feelings would be totally valid because his feelings are totally valid the age gap isnt the issue here,MagicCarpet5846
look man if you wanna be prejudiced against people how about you say it with your whole chest because otherwise ill continue to look at the actual behavior of the individuals before making someone out to be predatory,MagicCarpet5846
dont be too hard on yourself your future is so important and as much as it sucks this didnt work out there will be other guys out there your story isnt uncommon at all i did a similar degree and at the start a lot of our class was in relationships and within that first year unless the couples were already engagedmarried not many were able to survive the stress of being a full time professional student,MagicCarpet5846
not for anything but thats not really an accurate contextualization either most 28 year olds have an established career already its a fully fledged adult and you have been at that point for a few years 40 also isnt really middle aged and if it is its only barely youre naturally trying to make her seem younger and him older but at this point the differences in their age are nowhere near that of a 20 and a 32 year old and again he isnt at all saying she cant do anything outside of him its just a simple fact that its really hard to make meaningful time for a partner when youre doing a medical degree and working full time and still managing to work out and take care of yourself please stop trying to make this about his age almost any other 28 year old would have similar feelings here its completely normal to feel this way in a relationship where your partner is either unable or unwilling to give adequate time to the relationship i dont understand why youre trying to make this about some weird power dynamic when anyone who has gone through a professional degree like nursing doctor lawyer knows that half of your class starts out in a relationship and by the end of that first year a whole heck of a lot of them are newly single because they just cant devote enough time to the relationship to make it work,MagicCarpet5846
the age gap isnt actually the problem if anything its op thats the problem as she really doesnt have the time right now to properly maintain a relationship and thats why she totally made the right call in recognizing that and recognizing her partner was unhappy and it was unfair,MagicCarpet5846
i think youre being way too heavily biased by the years theyre born for once i dont see this as an issue of age believe it or not adults partake in the same hobbies at all ages so take age out of the question if these two were the same age you wouldnt really be saying that its completely normal for him to feel alone and unloved in a relationship where they see each other once a week live a decent drive apart and shes going to school in a difficult program while working full time that means she really doesnt have a lot of time to give him and frankly very few people are okay with having a partner with so little time to spare and who blatantly says you arent as important to me as schoolwork even if true and i agree prioritize school that is a statement that is going to sting and be really hard to maintain a positive and supportive relationship with someone he isnt demanding she drop out he is just voicing his extremely valid feelings its hard to imagine anyone wouldnt feel abandoned and unloved in a relationship like op is describing and its understandable that he would struggle to be really supportive while also balancing his career and his own emotions about the relationship op certainly isnt emotionally supporting her ex so its not really hard to see why he wouldnt be emotionally supporting her,MagicCarpet5846
now shes not in the wrong she needs to focus on school and build her career but that also probably means she needs to do it while single until she actually has enough time to devote to a relationship because just like she needs to spend a lot of time on school you also need to spend a lot of time cultivating a loving and healthy relationship she made the right choice to end things not because of his age but because she doesnt have the time and he was rightfully unhappy with the dynamic it happens op handled things incredibly maturely not surprising since she isnt exactly young and i say this because someone is saying he groomed her at 28,MagicCarpet5846
you may want to discuss a prenup if you havent already you two still love each other and want to spend your lives together and shes already looking to maximize her profit at your expense god help you if you two ever dont love each other shell take you for everything youre worth and then some you may trust her now when youre happy but prenups plan for the messy end not the happy beginning so be forewarned,MagicCarpet5846
make sure you have a solid plan in place for where you will go and who will be there to support you first make sure all of your documents are out of the house and have an overnight bag ready to go and a place to stay before you broach the conversation have a friend who will be on standby in case you need them hes threatened self harm so if that doesnt work he may become aggressive towards you,MagicCarpet5846
then you just wait until hes home and hasnt had a particularly bad day at workschool and say we need to talk about our relationship because i dont see this working out long term we have different views on sex and you have needs around intimacy i cant meet and im uncomfortable with the expectation physical intimacy needs to lead to sex or else youll be frustrated or unsatisfied its better for both of us to find partners who are on the same page as us with our love languages we need to figure out who will move out when if you have bills that you share whatever joint responsibilities you two have because i think its time for us to part ways i really do care about you but this dynamic isnt good for either of us,MagicCarpet5846
if he begins to beg just say i know this is really difficult and its difficult for me as well but its clear that after 6 years together we arent right for each other i dont want our fear of the unknown to keep us from actually finding a relationship where we can each have our needs met both of us deserve that and my decision is made i am not open to working on things anymore,MagicCarpet5846
if he threatens selfharm im sorry i know this hurts if you feel like you need support i can contact your friendsfamily and let them know so you dont have to go through this alone and if you really do have suicidal ideation then please speak to a therapist because i dont want anything bad to happen to you but i cannot and will not be your emotional crutch anymore i am happy to help you out with resources but im not going to entertain any attempts to place the burden of your mental wellbeing on me that isnt fair to do to me,MagicCarpet5846
id probably have been nicer his wife isnt listening to him and now his best friend isnt listening to him if he has no outlet for these emotions this is why people sometimes end up cheating that never thought they would hear him out at the end of the day losing a parent is traumatic but not a reason to give up on your relationshipstop living forever six months later is long enough that she needs to start at least acknowledging she needs to be working towards normalcy and intimacy in her marriage yes shes grieving but shes had that period of uninterrupted she comes first no matter what already its done and now its time for okay how do we move forward and find the new normal it seems like she isnt even willing to have that conversation with your friend despite him being proactive and trying to communicate which is a serious issue,MagicCarpet5846
apologies for being harsh but i find ignoring things just because they arent nice to hear is how we end up in situations like yours you knew he didnt love you and stayed anyway because you were hoping you were wrong its understandable but remember the only one youre hurting is yourself,MagicCarpet5846
youre worthy of love and you seem like a kind and genuine person you can afford to be a little bit stingy with who you give your heartbody to use this as a learning experience for the signs of someone who doesnt really love you and has poor intentions,MagicCarpet5846
its 100 teenagers and other young adults who think theyve learned how the world works by reading reddit and fail to realize life outside of a computer operates very differently  dont worry theyll learn eventually at least i hope,MagicCarpet5846
or more likely its neither but hes also afraid to be alone so he can use op for the emotional support until he finds someone he connects with physically and emotionally and then he leaves her this is really just monkeybranching with more steps,MagicCarpet5846
yep hes waiting until he finds someone else he connects with more and once he does itll be im sorry it just happened i didnt mean for it to but im in love with her,MagicCarpet5846
so obviously this guy sucks he saw an easy lay and he took it he took advantage of you and that isnt okay that being said its common for 18 and 23 year olds to make stupid mistakes and engage in shitty behavior like this its also common for one party to mentally break up long before they come out and say it so yeah i understand what he means by saying hes moved on already it sucks be proud of yourself for asking the question and leaving once he was honest it isnt your fault he didnt communicate hes young hes selfish and it was easier to wait until he was over you and had someone else lined up than deal with being sad and alone people get better as they get older but also plenty dont unfortunately youll experience this again most likely just know its because theyre emotionally immature not because you did anything wrong you were a young vulnerable kid who fell for the wrong guy it happens to the best of us let it hurt and itll be okay in the end,MagicCarpet5846
that is literally thousands of dollars to do 1500 the cheapest ive seen for an hour hes fallen on hard times and so that would be crazy stupid to do when his brother has a sports car not saying op needs to agree but renting a sports car is insanely expensive and cost prohibitive,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity if its once a month is this the same rough time of month in relation to its proximity to your period because this may also be due to hormone fluctuations which doesnt solve your issue but may also help to 1 combat it and 2 open up the conversation better so he understands its akin to being extra nice to your gf that has a cold,MagicCarpet5846
ill be clear now be careful of the comments saying your husband is being ridiculous he isnt its fair to want to compromise it is unfair to continue to be mad at him after he immediately understood his mistake apologized took responsibility and attempted to find a solution let go of the angerbeing upset and instead redirect to finding a feasible solution that both of you are happy with it sounds like you plan to do this in a few days time awesome,MagicCarpet5846
as far as your language no im not trying to find any personal flaws in you it seems youre misreading things i am simply pointing out a focus of your current dialogue is how you are feeling and while i respect the idea you dont want to speak for your husband its coming off as the opposite and to just be aware of this if it extends beyond this reddit post remember to let him decide what he thinks is feasible for himself he may not be sleep deprived at all i need 46 hours of sleep a night to function at full capacity and my partner needs 910 everyone is different so make sure to remember you thinking something isnt feasible doesnt make it true the number of times ive had people tell me they didnt think i could do something that i was already doing is immeasurable,MagicCarpet5846
at this point i think our conversation has run its course and i dont want to waste anymore of your time as i think this is getting redundant on both our parts good luck and have a lovely rest of the day,MagicCarpet5846
well 1 hes allowed to make a mistake he didnt realize he was making a commitment of your time and apologized for that at the end of the day he is human and you need to learn to let it go 2 its not really your place to decide what is and isnt a feasible option to him plenty of people absolutely work those hours and more with no issue 3 if he needs to be making phone calls sunday also realistically wouldnt work either but theres going to be a significant amount of admin work that doesnt rely on phone calls unless they run a call center the jobs theyre laying off arent 100 spent on the phone he can take over some of those responsibilities 4 im noticing a pretty heavy trend of i think and i believe remember you are one half of your marriage and just because you dont agree with something doesnt mean you unilaterally get to make that call,MagicCarpet5846
i never said you took an extreme view i meant the commenters on here take extreme views and just remember that sometimes the echo chamber that is the comments section can be misleading to how things will play out in your actual relationship,MagicCarpet5846
it sounds like youre open to compromise so hopefully you go into it remembering that your husband gets to decide what is and isnt feasible for him and you get to decide what is and isnt feasible for you and also remember people mess up in relationships i get being upset but he genuinely apologized and made it clear this was unintentional and wants to take steps to find a solution that works for both of you dont harp on the im upset you did the thing in the first place and instead focus on how are we going to find a solution that works better for both of us solution oriented problem solving which im sure an attorney will be beautifully prepared for so good luck,MagicCarpet5846
yeah i feel like it matters way less what everyone else thinks is normal and way more about what does she think is normal having her ex in her and her familys life and what are you comfortable with clearly youre not comfortable with having the ex in your or your gfs life,MagicCarpet5846
you are both entitled to your feelings and someone else on reddit agreeing or disagreeing politely means jack shit this isnt our life its yours and your gfs life you guys get to choose how you each want to live your lives if the way you both pick isnt compatible then you two arent compatible and should end things it seems like you arent comfortable with a girlfriend who has a relationship with an ex thats normal and valid however her relationship isnt so abnormal that it would be fair to expect her to cut him out of her life at this point the choices are accept things or leave but you also cant force yourself to accept things,MagicCarpet5846
like i said there are still other compromises ie if he still wants to help hell need to wake up 12 hours earlier and do the work then that way itll have little effect on your scheduleneeding a nanny,MagicCarpet5846
as far as your opinion on the business thats fair to consider a long term solution with his parents and have them discuss when enough is enough as a condition of you giving him a bit of time on the weekends but family isnt simply boiled down to numbers even though to you it makes sense to let them just lose everything now because in your mind its an inevitability that isnt how your husband feels its unwise to not at least make the attempt to compromise ie if he wants to do it wake up an hour earlier and then he can do an hour or two at some point on saturdaysunday then its him who is bearing the majority of the burden while youre also being his life partner and supporting himallowing him the ability to do what he feels obligated to do he may be amenable to letting you talk him out of helping now but thats because he still thinks things will work out and hes in new dad mode if his parents are in financial ruin and facing homelessness that could breed a lot of resentment and guilt and at that point youll no longer have any options for recourse other than hope he gets over it,MagicCarpet5846
like i said people on here will take very extreme views on how you should operate in a marriage and i mean if thats how you wanna be it is your life but its not usually the most conducive to a long term and healthy relationship good luck i know this is a difficult situation to navigate especially while pregnant,MagicCarpet5846
well heres the reality as much as players mental health needs to be taken into consideration if he isnt able to perform and theres an alternative that can perform he likely doesnt get to make that choice sen upper management clearly wants results as evidenced by syyko being cut mid split and they arent making decisions to spare the teams feelings this isnt a field where you keep your job just because youre well liked if youre not performing well its really unfortunate but more than just tenzs desire to compete is at play here,MagicCarpet5846
hopefully the decision is mutual because the alternative really sucks for tenz and id love to see him thriving again but is naive to act like him coming back or sitting out is strictly up to him,MagicCarpet5846
yeah op needs to understand this is who her boyfriend is and i mean i guess he is allowed to be that way he probably doesnt have bad intentions but he is intentionally trying to keep ops hopes low so they dont get crushed and thats not the sort of dynamic for most people,MagicCarpet5846
dating is an audition process and its okay to say he isnt fulfilling to roles requirements well enough,MagicCarpet5846
you should really just say how do you feel about marriage and go from there ask her when she wants to get married if shes ready to think about that with you if she is then say i want the actual ask to be a surprise but i want you to love the ring will you go to a few jewelers with me so we can figure out what you like in a budget that will work,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity if hes really that serious about it why doesnt he bring the admin work with him to his job and work on admin stuff while he eats his lunch thats 5 hours of work right there and then he can wake up early and do 2 hours before you and baby wake up sat and sun that means hes still able to help his family and youre able to spend time together,MagicCarpet5846
no offense but hes allowed to have 8 hours of time to himself maybe not all in one chunk but he can spread it out he may need to give up a hobby of his it isnt fair of you to say he cant help out his parents and while he seems much better than i i would be really really put off if my partner tried telling me i couldnt spend a few hours a week helping out my parents to ensure they didnt lose everything i love my partner but i wouldnt just leave my parents out to dry like that either there are definitely better compromises out there that you guys need to discuss,MagicCarpet5846
people on here will downvote but just be aware they tend to be very extreme in their advice and rarely go for the more realistic and moderate routes that are required if you actually want a marriage to last,MagicCarpet5846
look if she learns that trying stuff and ending up in the hospital means you visit her shell keep doing it if you dont want her to do it again you dont visit her you dont call you dont respond you dont engage at all you leave it to her family and her medical professionals to get her the treatment she needs otherwise shell just learn that if she hurts herself enough youll come back,MagicCarpet5846
i mean unfortunately plenty of women like op who dont think thats a reason to leave so they unfortunately arent even wrong,MagicCarpet5846
yep 130 is also not even considered a genius its considered gifted and apparently in this case its gifted in being a jerk,MagicCarpet5846
not to mention a 130 iq isnt high enough for mensa acceptance on either testing scale and genius doesnt start until like 150 so not only are they silly for thinking iq is a good measure of intelligence they are also incapable of accurately even googling the requirements for what they claim to be which inevitably makes me doubt their claims,MagicCarpet5846
the ones acting like hes a predatory asshole no hes just a regular entitled asshole,MagicCarpet5846
sure thats in 40 years people are not talking about in the past 40 years theyre referring to recently the major demographic of reddit and most likely this sub is significantly younger than routinely flew 40 years ago to the extent of would know what the size of seats are like that source is nice but largely irrelevant to the actual argument of in recent years airlines are reducing passenger seat sizes,MagicCarpet5846
the comment that i was replying to was saying it was just about wanting to touch a woman though so thats the only point i was refuting theres absolutely no indication thats what this was about and more just wanting the person who gave him more space sitting next to him,MagicCarpet5846
sure but i really dont think this is some creepy he wanted to know the touch of a woman situation,MagicCarpet5846
this sub isnt about am i in the clear legally literally right in the rules its about the morals of a situation op is giving her sister a huge financial advantage at any age let alone a 19 year old single mom of twin infants the sister needs to know her place and follow the simple rule op has or shell lose the privilege of a free townhouse with enough room for her and her kids something shell quickly find will be virtually impossible for her to maintain otherwise you make choices in life its called being an adult if op really needs to she can just evict the sister so the aspect of technically maybe a tenant wouldnt really matter all that long,MagicCarpet5846
found the person who doesnt understand sarcasm without the s,MagicCarpet5846
idk man three years in and hes still this bad you may love him but he clearly doesnt reciprocate in the same ways you do you but weaponized incompetence would make my uterus shrivel up to dust,MagicCarpet5846
it might also just be a natural consequence of when you have less space you fill less space much like a liquid only fills the container its in its not so much reigning it in as much as you cant really be in a seat occupied by someone else,MagicCarpet5846
eh you would need to be clinically obese to not physically fit in economy seats believe it or not airplanes cost hundreds of millions of dollars they arent really making seats smaller possibly certain airlines on replacement aircrafts might be because most airplanes in commercial use are over a decade old americans are just getting bigger,MagicCarpet5846
dont make baseless accusations he wanted to be seated next to the smaller human being who wasnt saying anything about being in her bubble rather than the equally giant man who physically prevented him from spreading out it isnt about gender its about size,MagicCarpet5846
for 35 its definitely not real leather its polyester check the label to be sure that being said it looks awesome so as long as you think the material and quality of construction is worth the price the fit is awesome,MagicCarpet5846
ah then yeah thats always a possibility however they arent really violating the custody agreement op is just relying way too much on her ex husband and her ex husband is allowing it literally everyone here sucks the ap for being an ap the ex for cheating and for disrespecting his new gf to the surprise of no one and op for using her ex for emotional support and allowing her ex to do the same thing to the new woman as he did to her namely have one foot out the door,MagicCarpet5846
i dont really think ops exes current girlfriend can take ops ex to court to force him to respect his and ops custody arrangement op can take him to court the ex can take op to court but the ap cant do anything legally to make her boyfriend do anything with kids that arent hers,MagicCarpet5846
yeah but at some point you also need to remember youre 33 and mom of the mother of two kids and shes fueling with a 22 year old three years later she needs to learn to let it go move on and form her own support network that doesnt include her cheating ex husband,MagicCarpet5846
you also need couples counseling because this soon in youre in the honeymoon period and hes still in fixer mode that comes with seeing the woman hes madly in love with cry and be scared when that wears off and it will wear off the disgust and anger will return and those feelings of what you did will resurface talk it out now otherwise i can promise you in the next 5 years this ends your relationship people always act like they can forgive such huge breaches of trust and boundaries at first because theyre scared and then once it fades its never pretty dude sounds like he has a really good head on his shoulders and frankly you dont deserve him with how you behaved and even if you do manage to change theres still a chance that the damage will have been done take steps to minimize that risk good luck deal with your insecurities and need for your friends approval and oh yeah get better friends,MagicCarpet5846
ok yes cute no but wear whatever feels best,MagicCarpet5846
it could and it would be foolish to think you could actually treat them the same good on you for recognizing that not every person can be a parent to any kid,MagicCarpet5846
when you said doctors dont hand out prescriptions for epi pens like stickers and i mean they obviously dont literally but definitely plenty out there will give an epi just in case of escalation but that generalized statement was obviously based on the personal experience you shared in the next comment,MagicCarpet5846
its almost like your personal experience doesnt actually dictate how every other medical professional handles things,MagicCarpet5846
ofc yta your girlfriend wants her parents to know you arent using herthem and you basically refused to even give the illusion you arent using them and now your girlfriend is going to think you are using them so congrats on fucking that one up so badly,MagicCarpet5846
she said i want you to offer because i know he wont accept and if he does accept ill make up for it and you laughed in her face as you refused dont expect this relationship to last much longer,MagicCarpet5846
well if youre making way more than she does that her income becomes chump change which is obviously the situation she wants to be in but lets be real even the most beautiful of women cant guarantee theyd find a man wealthy enough to sign up for that deal,MagicCarpet5846
that definitely isnt actually reasonable advice if shes trying to work through the issue at that point you might as well just break up and find a man who has already had a vasectomy or is fine with getting one,MagicCarpet5846
believe it or not real adults who are almost 40 and engaged dont react well to well if youre not going to do as i say then no more sex,MagicCarpet5846
nta she was clearly trying to act like some queen bee in front of her other friends and all you did was prove her point shes a sad little mean girl the only thing she wasnt expecting is not everyone wants to be friends with the sad little mean girl just because theyre pretty good for you,MagicCarpet5846
or he didnt check it for nuts because he wasnt the one who ate it it was on the passenger side and his mom brought the snacks i personally dont police what someone else is eating while im behind the wheel of a car do you,MagicCarpet5846
it sounds like his mom gave him a bunch of snacks and then his mother opened one and put the trash on the floor and the husband hadnt looked at the snacks either that or that was the only almond one and mil specifically had that for herself as she didnt think it would effect op husband cannot know something he hasnt seen or didnt eat has nuts in it,MagicCarpet5846
nta obviously but she isnt going to pay it you need to decide if youre willing to go the legal route over this or if youll simply go nc over it until she agrees to pay,MagicCarpet5846
but i will promise you right now if you dont do either of those things and just accept her refusal to pay she will get way worse because now youve embarrassed her and let her get away with it,MagicCarpet5846
well do you feel you want to proceed in a marriage knowing this is how hell handle conflict of his own making ultimately thats the real question like i said if this isnt handled to your liking i wouldnt get married unless you also are okay with getting divorced because this is the best your conflict resolution skills will ever be a few years into marriage too many people forget to put their partners feelings into perspective,MagicCarpet5846
ask him why he lied to you and go from there dont accuse him just say i found out youre still going on labor day weekend im really hurt you lied to me can you help me understand why you felt you needed to lie rather than just talk to me about things,MagicCarpet5846
if you two cant talk this through i personally would probably rethink getting married unless youre prepared to get divorced because no healthy marriage lasts without healthy communication in a way this is a great test for if this is even a wedding worth having,MagicCarpet5846
bruh you think a bunch of her friends in college should just go borrow money to go and have fun thats the most irresponsible shit ive seen here today,MagicCarpet5846
im glad you two seem to have a lovely marriage its important to make sure the emotional intimacy doesnt get replaced with fancy shoes or bags i wish you two many more happy years together even though youve said things have largely blown over you should have a discussion on boundaries dont delete messages if you want to offer something to someone who feel deserves it let me know we are a team and i want to share that with you dont offer people gifts over 500 without discussing it with me whatever it may be that you feel comfortable with but i wouldnt just dismiss this as its blown over now so its all good because like i said this is often how it starts better to catch things and communicate early than be another heartbreak story and good luck in all your future opportunities,MagicCarpet5846
sure thats the reason the law was written but the law states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you doesnt translate to it only applies if the company is trying to bill you for it im not even really arguing the legality of it but i am saying that laws are often used in contexts other than the express context it was written for in fact thats pretty much what being a lawyer in certain fields is all about finding a way to argue why a law applies to you and expanding the interpretation of the penned words,MagicCarpet5846
eta damn some of yall do not understand that laws are in fact open to interpretation and that is why lawyers judges and other leo are required otherwise a computer could just take everything over also didnt make a claim about how this would play out one way or the other just that this law specifically states you dont need to pay for merchandise sent to you that you didnt order im not going to reply to anyone who thinks basic reading skills are mental gymnastics,MagicCarpet5846
well doesnt seem speculative seems accurate you said youve been together since high school grew up poor you are used to retail jobs so i presume the businesses you own are driven by him and you supporthelp him but arent the driving force and you said he has insecurities about his appearance but at least now is a good looking wealthy dude,MagicCarpet5846
this is generally speaking how fairy tale romance ends with him trading me in for a woman half my age stories begin its easy to get sucked into something new and fresh and that feeling of being flattered by being wanted by someone seemingly unattainable now im not saying hes got bad intentions yet but you probably need to be aware that this is a concern like i said you guys should focus on reconnecting and making sure that your emotional bond is strong the gifts are nice and all but outside of material goods make sure you two are in a good place and keeping the flame alive talk to someone about what are healthy boundaries and how you can praise those around you and be generous without crossing a line being with the same person for 30 years is hard and requires a lot of active work to keep that love alive he seems to love you so im sure youll work it out but i definitely wouldnt ignore this,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity is he extremely wealthy because this definitely sounds like looking for an upgrade territory you two probably could benefit from a trip to a couples therapist to discuss appropriate boundaries and how you two are feeling about each other in general and given the vibe im getting from the post a romantic trip to reconnect,MagicCarpet5846
well technically someone with your correct address on it and not a human beings name on it would qualify unless you think loft on hold is ops next door neighbors name,MagicCarpet5846
you got the ick once you catch it you only cure it by breaking up and moving on,MagicCarpet5846
it doesnt typically and it shouldnt if youre unwilling to share the actual life youve built with a person during marriage dont marry them its fair to want to protect the assets given to you by family and assets you gained before the marriage but if you are even worried about sharing the assets youll gain during the marriage take that as a glaring sign that this isnt the woman for you a marriage is merging lives with someone that includes finances,MagicCarpet5846
well shes 22 and just had a baby so shes hormonal and emotionally immature theyre not exactly a great combo and id take a guess and say it wasnt planned so shes also probably extremely confused on what the fuck she wants to do with her life now if you can reach out to the aunt make sure she has someone in her corner looking out for her she either is struggling with ppd or shes just another young and unprepared mom trying to figure things out and handling it poorly but either way you probably cant fix her so just make sure she has someone around her that is looking out for her,MagicCarpet5846
honestly fashionova has great jeans for curvy women,MagicCarpet5846
yikes so in your world a father cant just be a good dad and a daughters preferred parent,MagicCarpet5846
a judge wants both parents in a kids life but im sure there is a solution in here where they are both in her life just not in a weekly capacity its pretty standard in these situations to spend the school year with the primary custodian and then breaks and summer with the other parent the mom can fly up to see the daughter and the daughter can fly once a month all that combined and thats a significant amount of time between both parents while still respecting what the daughter wants and without expecting her to fly by herself every single weekend,MagicCarpet5846
controversial but nta your daughter wanted to go with you shes 14 her opinion is going to heavily be taken into consideration even in a court but it should be 1month for a long weekend she can afford to miss a day of school and then she should spend breaks with her mom she still needs to see her mother and get quality time with her but youre right traveling by plane every week is ridiculous perhaps tell your ex shes welcome to fly up as well to spend time with daughter,MagicCarpet5846
youre making excuses for him and keep focusing on the ex the issue isnt the ex the issue is him and how he reacted to your hurt and not for anything but youve seen how he treated his ex who was his supposed love of his life so why do you think you will end up any differently,MagicCarpet5846
you wont thats the answer so stop distracting yourself by focusing on the ex and start reflecting on how he is treating you,MagicCarpet5846
the issue here isnt actually that he called her the love of his life the issue is 1 why is he telling his girlfriend of a year a story of his ex of over a half decade and 2 he responded to your hurt not with compassion and care but with an insult,MagicCarpet5846
thats the issue youre not insecure any selfrespecting person will question why someone years later is speaking in present tense about their feelings for an ex its just plain idiotic to not see how that isnt a giant red flag so short of your boyfriend being an idiot hes doing so because he either does have feelings for her eh probably not if what youre saying is true even though i do doubt the veracity of that 5 years nc and as soon as he meets you shes begging for him back eh not that convinced or he is unable to take accountability for his missteps and refuses to apologize for hurting you his supposed love of his life thats the issue here thats what you need to be thinking about your boyfriend called you insecure and ridiculous for having a valid concern that anyone with a brain would have frankly you would be insecure if you didnt question him because it would show youd put up with such obvious bullshit,MagicCarpet5846
nta the reality is you saved m from staying another 5 years and not having a real engagement ring you either got t to take his head out of his ass long enough to realize he cant keep putting off this commitment and expecting m to stay or you havent gotten through to t and now m is realizing that this isnt what she wants after this long with a man either way youre nta and thank you for saying what m was very clearly thinking but was trying to convince herself she was crazy for if she breaks up with t its because of t not you and if anything you saved m from a lifetime of unhappiness with t maybe next time t wont assume he has unlimited time to string along women he loves or he actually proposes either way win win for everyone involved,MagicCarpet5846
idk man i have to think you enabling him is part of why hes never changed,MagicCarpet5846
idk what rich people you know but every one i know has a substantial life insurance policy,MagicCarpet5846
the more money a person has the better and greater the insurance they tend to have i dont know why youd think someone with money wouldnt have massive life insurance and other policies its poor people with families who actually need the money that often have to forgo the backup plan,MagicCarpet5846
go reread the fourth paragraph of the post its literally right there in quotes and all,MagicCarpet5846
id probably get your head out of your ass and realize material things dont make someone a good grandparent and who you allow in your childrens life will have a huge impact on who they grow up to be you know your parents arent good people and arent good influences for your children why would you compromise your values and your kids upbringing just so they can have someone well off in their lives,MagicCarpet5846
i am not it literally says in the post the friend has said op will change her mind on not wanting marriage or kids and will often use the exact words when youre a mom when talking to op about her own pregnancy that is not the kind of shit you do to your friend who 1 doesnt want kids 2 has always supported you and 3 is going through a fresh breakup because of 1 reread the post if that isnt at all clear to you but it is directly in the main post im not making anything up or putting my own spin on anything,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846

nta just tell the moh and anyone else who comes for you i have a medical condition sister can decide if me being a bridesmaid in an altered dress or me not being a bridesmaid at all will be the best option for her that is available but i have a medical condition unfortunately what she wants in a perfect world is no longer possible in this world where i have a medical condition if sister has decided shed rather her own family stand beside her than have a perfect photo im still happy to get the dress altered so i can wear it but those are sisters only two options plans change what was an option a few months ago no longer is and thats just a part of life,MagicCarpet5846
generally when speaking your best friend who has done so much for you talking about her heartbreak and losing someone she cared about because she doesnt want kids is not the time to start bullshit like when youre a mom op doesnt want kids she doesnt need yet another person in her life who refuses to respect the fact that a womans worth isnt solely dependent on their decision to carry a life in them,MagicCarpet5846
her best friend isnt respecting her or her decisions about her life and her body yeah thats definitely not harsh and frankly id have been way harsher,MagicCarpet5846
eh you can definitely see cellulite but everyone has it no matter how thin or fat i am i have it its just genetic and even super models have it theyre just better at hiding it like you said nothing wrong with it though since 99 of people have it and all those use this one trick to destroy cellulite for good stuff you see is just a gimmick,MagicCarpet5846
yes it does,MagicCarpet5846
so you probably dont want to come to terms with this but your wife isnt over her ex because she doesnt feel the same way about you as she did him shes with you because you didnt leave her not because shes head over heels in love with you if she were head over heels in love with you the same way she was her ex shed have forgotten about him thats often how we really move on from those heartbreaking losses we find the next person that makes us feel the sameeven better sometimes we have relationships in between that we still mourn the ex and we say oh we arent over him were not ready to date anyone else etc etc and yeah in part that is true but also its true that generally you meet that person when you are ready that youre just crazy about and suddenly those dreams stop the tears you barely even remember why you were crying you remember how much better off you are and how wrong that relationship was,MagicCarpet5846
but instead of moving on from you like would usually naturally do at 18 and finding that person she clearly struggles with rejection being alone and wanting to feel wanted so she stayed with you and you were head over heels in love with her so of course youd never be the one to leave shes been shoving these feelings down for an eternity because she feels guilt over these feelings but thats what it comes down to she just doesnt feel the way about you as she does about her ex and if you told her this shell cry and shell beg you to stay because shes never actually progressed beyond that 18 year old girl who cant deal with rejection or being alone so shell cling to whoever is around and willing to give her that love even if it isnt actually the love she wants,MagicCarpet5846
pick anything you want then you seem to think im specifically talking about antisemitism and fail to understand what an analogy is so pick cheaters cheaters dont actively threaten your safety at all but plenty of people will choose not to invite someone to their wedding because they cheated on their spouse and morally object to that behavior that also is their sex life and shouldnt be any of your business that also doesnt have any actual affect on you but youd still agree someone is fully in their right to decide they are morally opposed to cheaters and dont want them around them right,MagicCarpet5846
because newsflash they definitely have that right and newsflash same thing applies here,MagicCarpet5846
why is the argument his sex life has nothing to do with you a reason hes not allowed to disagree would you say the same if this was a person who cheated on their spouse of 10 years while pregnant and op was saying i dont agree with your morals so im not inviting you because i dont support cheaters because its the same exact thing that pertains to their sex life and doesnt actually affect op but i can guarantee you everyone on here would say op is nta for not inviting the brother then the reality is people are allowed to choose not to be around people who have different morals than them even if you dont agree with those morals and yes people are allowed and i would fully argue should choose to uphold their values even if they dont directly affect them like why do you actually want that to be the standard because thats like saying as a white person youre an asshole for uninviting someone racists against whomever because well youre white so it doesnt even affect you but the fuck of course you should stand up for your values of not being racist and in fact if it were race being the issue here everyone would be saying you need to stand up for your morals even if it doesnt affect you otherwise youre being hypocritical,MagicCarpet5846
you can have different morals and views to op about sexual freedom and still recognize that op is allowed to have that view and not want to be around someone who acts like his brother just because they happen to share blood,MagicCarpet5846
i mean its completely fair and valid not to invite someone you dont agree with their morals and life choices to your wedding lets not act like just because you dont agree with someones decision doesnt mean it isnt their right to make that decision thats like not inviting someone because they are antisemitic and you dont approve of nazis even though you yourself arent jewish it has no bearing on you and no impact on your life personally but youre still allowed to say this isnt behavior or choices i am okay or comfortable being around its really easy to agree that the people getting married have that right when its something you can clearly agree is wrong isnt it but thats the thing everyone has the right to make that choice and yes even people with views you dont agree with,MagicCarpet5846
that being said its definitely important to recognize that he wont have a relationship with his brother and much like op can post about this on the internet so can his brother especially when he sent a freaking letter and op needs to accept that however for anyone saying hell lose his brother with this behavior honestly do you actually think he cares it sounds like hes pretty emphatically throwing the brother out so i dont think that statement is likely to affect op at all,MagicCarpet5846
hes either asexualon the asexual spectrum or hes not attracted to you either way no i dont think he comes around if sexual compatibility is a dealbreaker for you you should end the relationship sooner rather than later because lying to yourself is only going to hurt you in the long run,MagicCarpet5846
well fuck that guy then hes guy a boring old misogynistic hypocrite,MagicCarpet5846
where is that i didnt see that anywhere in the postcomments if i missed it and this isnt a standard hes also holding himself to then fuck that guy regardless end result is the same he isnt the person for op,MagicCarpet5846
yeah there is pretty much no part of a heathy happy and functional relationship here theres no intimacy no respect no trust and sounds like your feelings for him are very quickly waning you cant really tell me this is what you imagined in your husband is it if not respect and love yourself in a way he is never going to and find that relationship,MagicCarpet5846
i mean you cant really trust a man who isnt worth trusting unless youre going to brow beat yourself into accepting being treated like trash is that really what you want to do to yourself because he isnt worthy of being trusted thats why you dont trust him,MagicCarpet5846
i think you need some harsh truths,MagicCarpet5846
yes you need to give her space if you refuse to give her the space shes asking for her feelings are going to very quickly succumb to the resentment that will quickly build but in giving her that space most likely shes going to feel relief shes going to feel the weight that is being in a relationship with a man like you lifted and then your relationship will truly be over,MagicCarpet5846
its hard but i think you need to learn this being grumpy isnt some cute personality quirk its fucking annoying and not something anyone selfrespecting wants in a life partner no one wants to be with a man who acts like they dont even like their partner and ive been there it sucks and yeah most likely her feelings for you are pretty done and dusted women try and try and try and once they get to the point where theyre telling you theyre falling out of love and need space 99 of the time they are out of love with you already but just cant admit it to you or themselves yet you may need to genuinely feel this loss to understand that you dont get to just suck for three years and then finally decide to see a problem with how youre acting you shouldnt be putting loved ones through your tantrums youre 27 its time you grow up and learn to be a kind respectful patient person and yes that likely will mean doing it single for a long while and getting a therapist to work through things with you to make sure you dont prematurely jump back into dating and someone who can hold you accountable to yourself,MagicCarpet5846
depends how exactly did this come up its been three years together did you ask some hypothetical or did he out of the blue just tell you hes never going to let you see his phone because if this came up naturally in conversation it probably means nothing and id just respect his feelings if this came up unprompted out of nowhere id be getting highly suspicious,MagicCarpet5846
it sounds like hes a virgin hes allowed to want to share that experience with his partner however if its a dealbreaker for him and hes said it is then you need to walk away you arent what he wants and its totally wrong of him to shame you for not being his perfect made to order bride hes a coward for not telling you this himself but you need to move on the right person will come along who wont care about your extremely limited past but the reality is this person does care and thats okay but it isnt okay to stay with someone who doesnt accept you as you are,MagicCarpet5846
i mean there are plenty of 25 year old virgins in religious circles and even more still who just havent found that person or are waiting for personal reasons i dont think its really fair to say he wont find a virgin if thats something important to him it sounds like he himself is a virgin as well however he needs to recognize if he wants a virgin and thats an actual dealbreaker that he needs to share that one and only experience with his partner he needs to stop dating someone who he clearly cant have that with its completely wrong to shame someone for not being who you want over something they cant control,MagicCarpet5846
its like saying dating someone who is under 6 tall is a dealbreaker and then continuing to go out with someone who is 56 they arent going to grow and if thats what you want in a partner okay thats fine but then dont waste someones time who is clearly also looking for a serious partner,MagicCarpet5846
you and your husband should go to counseling and you personally need some help to accept that your ils will never accept you and will never like you i get its hard but you need to make peace with this fact so you can move forward your husband will also need to come to terms with how that will affect his family dynamic so he can make sure hes okay with that it very much sounds like he is but you need to stop they arent going to like you it is what it is it hurts absolutely but you need to get the idea of if only i did xyz they might finally like me they wont unless youre able to suddenly turn into a good korean housewife theyll never like you thats okay your husband married you not them but you arent doing yourself or your marriage any favors by trying to get people who simply never will like you to like you drop the rope live your life be happy stand up for yourself stop accepting hatred in your life,MagicCarpet5846
idk the party was a lie so sounds like the alcohol was merely a coverin order to soothe the nerves she had about cheating,MagicCarpet5846
you remind your brother her behavior isnt normal it isnt healthy and while you support him and will always be there for him you arent going to enable toxic behavior from her and just remind him that youre there for him if he realizes this isnt what he wants in a relationship anymore,MagicCarpet5846
just remember it may be his choice to put up with controlling borderline abusive behavior in silence but that doesnt mean he gets to choose for you how youll react its pretty clear he knows this is ridiculous and probably is putting up with it either because of the idea women can do no wrongcant controlabuse a man or because he thinks he cant do better than this woman either way its not your job to keep the peace in someone elses toxic relationship,MagicCarpet5846
dont feel badly that it affecting your finances was the final straw be so proud of yourself for even having that straw because you know deep down you shouldve had a final straw long ago and just be proud youve finally found it and then stick to it because youre right hes abusive and plain and simply not worth it,MagicCarpet5846
it can both be true that he needs help and you cant provide him the help he needs you need to put yourself first because he clearly always has and always will put himself first you cannot thrive in this marriage this marriage is literally killing you slowly pick you you deserve it,MagicCarpet5846
perfect then i think you should send this or a similarly worded message to gracefully bow out while also directly saying i understand you felt obligated to ask me and i am not comfortable with that so i will be the fall guy rather than going to route of making up a conflict its to the point but it doesnt make her feel like the bad guy as youre saying you dont feel comfortable being in such an intimate place with someone who clearly that intimacy isnt there yet and thats okay,MagicCarpet5846
a year isnt long at all so i wouldnt use shes never shown any behavior like this before as justification or an excuse its super easy not to show your true colors for a year youre an older established guy who owns a 3 story house dating a younger woman im not calling you out on anything but you really cant expect much more from her and you would be very foolish to continue dating someone who has shown you the ugly truth of herself the minute things didnt go her way,MagicCarpet5846
and let me guess you wouldnt have her pay much if any rent right youre being taken for a ride,MagicCarpet5846
tbf if he wasnt a deadbeat dad this would be completely normal dynamic for a kid and his father youre really telling me you never did anything with your parents and a friend or even with any of your friends growing up because i definitely did the issue is still the fact that the father never sees his son making it so the few times he does step up precious father son time but it shouldnt be it should just be another weekend together but this time his son wants to bring a friend,MagicCarpet5846
yeah when your self esteem is this low youre going to sabotage any genuine attempts to lose weight as well because you feel you dont deserve to look and feel good either so you really need to deal with the self esteem before you can even lose the weight and keep it off,MagicCarpet5846
explain to me why youd want a cheater and a hypocritical deadbeat dad as friends anyway you are the company you keep op and neither of these people are winners tell adam and if that ruins the friendships with everyone then good riddance,MagicCarpet5846
the brother dropped out of high school and refused to get a job presumably its because he thought now that he was 18 he could do what he wanted and what he wanted to do was nothing while i dont agree with his parents giving him 3 days bare minimum of 30 days like you would a tenant seems like the bare minimum here i do think its fair for his parents to have the attitude of if you think because youre 18 you can make the adult decision to drop out of high school and not listen to anything we have to say then you can also live like an adult and be on your own while uncommon it does happen and it happened to my sibling before where they expected to just stay at home all day doing nothing because theyre an adult and also having mommy and daddy do everything for them still not every parent will enable that behavior even a little,MagicCarpet5846
talk to your husband first and make sure he has your back once you know that he is on your side just send a text message sil while im honored that you wouldve thought to include me in your special day i dont feel comfortable being included in such an intimate part of your day simply because im your brothers wife i would love to be there as your guest but i need to step down as bridesmaid if theres anything i can do from afar please let me know as i want this day to be very special for you,MagicCarpet5846
if stepping down is going to start ww3 with your husband and his family its probably better to just tell her youre busycant make it to any smaller events and just suck it up for the wedding day this isnt really that unusual of a situation and as uncomfy as it is if this isnt your hill to die on and your husbandhis family wont be supportive its probably not worth it to make this your hill to die on,MagicCarpet5846
not to doubt your relationship seeing as youre already pregnant but next time you should both wait a decent period of time before introducing your partners to your kid you need to make sure you guys know and are comfortable with who your new partners are and after 7 and 8 months it really doesnt seem like enough time has passed for either of them to be taking on any sort of parental role or going on trips or things like that moving on takes time rushing it can lead to some really crappy outcomes its harder when you have a kid but her well being and safety needs to come before either of your desires to have a new happy family,MagicCarpet5846
let yourself be sad cry if you need to do something to get your mind off her even if that means having less work time itll be better to have 18 hours of good work time than 40 hours of horrible work time so make sure to take care of yourself one night too you cant just shove the feelings down and expect to move on overnight you will make it through the course i know it feels like the end of the world if you dont do great on one assignment but i can tell you i have had my fair share of crappy weeks and i survived multiple top technical programs in the world it wont affect anything in your life in the grand scheme of things even if you need to take a few days to take care of yourself before sitting down to work on your final projects do your best you will make it through,MagicCarpet5846
the only unreasonable bit is you trying to force yourself to be okay in a marriage where your partner doesnt pull his own weight and cant be arsed to spend time with you you deserve and can get way better,MagicCarpet5846
his poor wife holy shit,MagicCarpet5846
look heres the reality hes built up an idea of who you will be as his partner in his head and that idea is likely very different from who you actually are this man is successful and going to divorce his wife for you only to discover the real you isnt actually as good as he imagined in his head im sure youre lovely but youre real and human you two both clearly know from experience that marriages and real life are hard and even though you go into things loving a person that doesnt mean itll work out and now that he has all these unrealistic ideas of what being with you is like and he realizes thats not the case itll end ugly,MagicCarpet5846
your boyfriend is blaming ocd on what is him being an abusive asshole you cant turn it off on command if you could ocd wouldnt be a disorder perhaps he genuinely has ocd but the actual behaviors caused by his ocd would still remain everything that he turned off in the past week is who he is it isnt a disorder thats an excuse flat out and plainly it was bullshit meant to get you to accept poor treatment from him,MagicCarpet5846
he lied to you he is abusive he doesnt trust you he is both unwilling and unable to change i understand its scary to be without someone youve spent so long with and have shared so much with but 3 years is nothing in the grand scheme of forever you will meet someone you will be with much longer than him and instead of having a pervasive theme of lies abuse and fear youll feel happiness and youll wonder why the hell you stayed with such a crappy partner for so long and why you put up with such obvious bullshit for so long when you couldve had this a happy and loving relationship all this time,MagicCarpet5846
this is the end of a chapter its okay to grieve but put down the horror story and pick up a romance novel with someone else or hell even just yourself,MagicCarpet5846
you misread the story the last time the kids looked at the box was 6 years ago the half brother has asked to look at the box but this isnt a situation where the kids are constantly stealing this box he just carries it everywhere and a 5 year old is naturally curious the insider information i have is being even somewhat familiar with how a 15 year old boy acts towards siblings they arent exactly nice siblings are viscous to each other at times then add in lost mom and blended family it doesnt take a rocket scientist to see this is a normal teenage boy acting out but that doesnt mean that its not op and his fathers job to teach him that you need to learn patience and cruelly lashing out isnt okay,MagicCarpet5846
you need to stop being so forgiving youre being a pushover your wife is turning into the equivalent of a redpilled tater tot as the internet likes to call them for the sake of your children and society at large you need to start pushing back on this way harder than you are youre operating as though what she is doing isnt tantamount to racism or homophobia i take it you wouldnt tolerate that attitude so why are you tolerating an attitude that is propagating hatred against men when youre raising two little boys,MagicCarpet5846
stop giving her a pass on her hatred prejudice and bigotry just because shes a woman that in and of itself is sexist hold her to the same standard you would hold a man who told his wife that she needs to take care of all chores childrearing be a sex slave who never says no to any sex act and never speaks unless spoken to hold her to the same standard you would if a man dared to in public try to humiliate and shame his wife who is doing everything like she did to you,MagicCarpet5846
i get that you think youre being prowomen but you dont be prowomen by being antiman this isnt behavior you should be tolerating because youre afraid to be coming off as controllingsexistwhatever it is that youre clearly afraid of seeming because this behavior is truly abhorrent and i cant imagine a man as progressive as you are genuinely believing this attitude should be okay for anyone of any gender,MagicCarpet5846
sit him down and tell him youve been going too far with the criticism lately im not okay with it from now on you either need to learn to keep your opinions of how you want things done to yourself or you need to be prepared to do it your way by yourself the next time something like what happened last night at dinner happens again i am stopping what im doing regardless of where i am in the process and you will be fully taking over i will not be putting things away i will not be cleaning up anything i need you to understand loud and clear just how serious i am about this not continuing if theres something that bothers you so deeply that you want to just take over from now on now is the chance to tell me are we on the same page,MagicCarpet5846
if he gets at all angry walk away and say this is what i mean im leaving the conversation until you can continue this like an adult in a healthy relationship if you cant figure out how to have a conversation without belittling me then this relationship isnt going to work out find me once youve decided and leave go read a book go for a walk take a bath whatever it is that you want but show him that you mean business because right now he plain and simply doesnt respect you you need to demand respect and make it clear that if he doesnt start respecting you you are prepared to walk away,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity if your husband is the one who is all dont disagree with anyone unhealthy bottle stuff in crap have you ever tried telling him not to speak to you that way i mean thats his preferred method of communication after all unless theres some hidden hierarchy youre not addressing where as the man of the household youre meant to follow him vibes going on,MagicCarpet5846
of course women are allowed to speak its not about her gender at all try not to make things that arent about gender about gender its about the person who did bring it up did so with no intention to actually change the relationship at all she basically dangled a relationship carrot in front of op who was eagerly awaiting the moment they would become official which idk why he didnt bring it up himself since he clearly wanted it only for her to say aaaactually im still fucking and plan to continue to fuck other dudes,MagicCarpet5846
you really gunna tell me that isnt humiliating unless shes denser than a bag of rocks she knows damn well what soooooo what are we on a romantic dinner out implies it is meant to progress the relationship forward not to literally say hey i just want to make sure youre clear that this isnt going anywhere and i also wont stop seeing other people she raised up ops hopes waited to make sure that he was happy about the offer of something more only to assure him that wasnt at all what she wanted or planned to do thats about as humiliating as it gets in terms of rejection in a situationship,MagicCarpet5846
wait until it actually is truth before youre patting yourself on the back there bud one bad map does not months of mediocre tape make sure if he is consistently on the bottom of the leaderboard you may have a point but you also have no way of knowing yet if he wont drop 30 every map next week,MagicCarpet5846
its an unhealthy behavior to develop of staying in a relationship only because you or he loves the other love isnt enough and you should always base your decision on whether to continue a relationship based on how your partner is treating you in the moment not in the past and not how you want him to treat you in the future  youll save yourself from a lot of toxic and crappy relationships if you remember those two rules,MagicCarpet5846
unfortunately if rachel thought finding a man with a family to provide for her kids was so important to her she should not have married your father she needs to either accept the incredibly sad and i entirely sympathize with her and her kids reality that they just dont have any family outside of their parentshalf siblings or she needs to divorce your father and go find a man who has family who will accept nonbio kids with open arms it sucks but this is the family she chose to marry into and youre under no obligation to cater to her wishes this is just like someone complaining about their crazy inlaws and trying to get them to changecut them out of their lives adults need to realize you dont just marry the man youre marrying the family if you arent happy enough with the total package as it is you dont proceed with the marriage just like you dont marry a man for their potential you marry them for who they are,MagicCarpet5846
and let this be a life lesson for you too youre marrying a man but also youre marrying into a family and you need to consider those dynamics when evaluating if this is a something you will be happy in forever,MagicCarpet5846
definitely remain nc the fact that she brought it up even knowing she didnt want exclusivity is pretty humiliating  that being said dont wait for the woman to bring it up next time when youre ready you should be bringing it up i can only assume its insecurityfear and thats also probably not an attractive trait,MagicCarpet5846
if it were me even if i did want a serious relationship i would quickly lose interestrecalibrate my feelings if after 5 months this conversation wasnt brought up just an fyi,MagicCarpet5846
not in this day and age,MagicCarpet5846
im going to be honest its decently fucked up she would bring up the what are we talk while actually not wanting anything to change about your relationship and in fact not wanting exclusivity it almost feels as though she knew you thought you two were heading towards exclusivity and felt extremely guilty about seeing and sleeping with other people and was attempting to clear her conscience take this as a sign she isnt ready or worth another serious thought and cut your losses definitely remain nc because its very clear she doesnt want a relationship and the fact that she would so callously mess with your feelings by asking you what are we while fully knowing she didnt want you to be anything is just not worth any more time,MagicCarpet5846
yeah definitely dont invest your time money and effort into a woman whos shown you shes only looking for someone to provide for her and benefit her she wants a one sided relationship and that cant last forever once things get hard the relationship will fall apart and if you marry her while being an executive she may show you just how selfcentered she really is and take you for all youre worth its a really common story,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think its unfair i think both 5050 and proportional are valid payment schemes but you do need to decide what works best for youyour values and stick to it if she was always down for 5050 then id say thats just as fair even though shes getting more free money now but its pretty clear her values arent we are equal partners5050 or we should each be contributing equal parts relative to our skills proportional to income her values are quite simply i expect the man to take care of me which is also a fair enough desire but op needs to understand her partners values and decide if thats the role he wants to fill not every man does and thats okay,MagicCarpet5846
i honestly do think they both cheated emotional affairs are affairs and he said he accused her of one during their marriage and then theyre married within a year of the divorce that definitely screams emotional affair,MagicCarpet5846
he cheated as well so at that point its clear you two both moved on from one another but im not sure how anyone can see the facts and the timeline and not think that there were mutual feelings involved long before the divorce was signed otherwise you just dont get married within a year to your ex husbands best friend,MagicCarpet5846
if she cant afford to move out then you assess how insane you think shell be in the breakup if shell be mature you ride it out maybe one of you sleeps on the couch if you think shell handle it poorly you get a new apartment and you ride it out for the 6 months left on your lease or whatever it is and a few weeks before move in you tell her thats pretty much your only option she clearly did something before you two lived together so she can figure someone out after too,MagicCarpet5846
moving forward dont move in with people youve known less time than some of the food in your fridge,MagicCarpet5846
some people think it makes themselves sound bad ass rather than weak she obviously isnt 100 sure if steve really did have feelings for daisy or not so i take it as the human equivalent of puffing yourself up in the face of danger so hopefully the predator will run away,MagicCarpet5846
people on reddit like to encourage others to do what will entertain strangers the most but this is your actual life you are living dont blow something up with someone you love because a bunch of strangers on the internet have nothing better to do than encourage more people to be miserable with them,MagicCarpet5846
thanks fam guess im the ass carry on,MagicCarpet5846
did you mean to reply to this comment because it makes no sense and makes you sound like a pompous ass in context,MagicCarpet5846
he would be correct if you decide to stay love yourself more than that,MagicCarpet5846
heres what you reply to every single person if standing up against the disrespect of the relationship with the woman i plan to spend my life with is something small to you that you think i should get over then god bless your marriage because no relationship will ever last with that attitude i will protect my relationship and back up the woman i love before i will anyone else,MagicCarpet5846
you seem to be making excuses for her this is a thing people do to defend themselves no one wants to admit they werent enough for their partner no one wants to admit they had a bad judge of character when they committed to someone but look its okay to make mistakes good people fall for bad ones all the time but your fianc has shown you a lot of flaws 1 she wont communicate with you when shes feeling down and has unaddressed needs in the relationship 2 she wont turn down the attention of another guy in at least some circumstances 3 your fianc is of so low class to get with a married man 4 your fianc doesnt respect you enough to come clean before you gave up a lucrative career and your future for her she shouldve told you then so you could make an informed decision shes trying to trap you 5 your fianc didnt even tell you because she finally realize just how fucked up this is she only told you because someone else made her feel guilty about it 6 youre with a woman so good at lying to you she can carry on a whole other relationship for months and youll be none the wiser and lie to your face for years and youll be none the wiser,MagicCarpet5846
now all this really taken into consideration are you going to tell me you can lay next to this woman every day for the rest of your life and feel peace if not its time to call off the wedding,MagicCarpet5846
have you ever met a 15 year old boy with any form of siblings they can be viscous its almost like redditors dont understand what teenagers are like form an objective perspective siblings say crap like this all the time without any trauma,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think they are asking him hes just saying it the daughters told op that he said it out of nowhere and according to op the one step sister who showed interest was told 6 years ago to knock it off it genuinely reads like the 15 year old is going through normal 15 year old growing pains combined with grieving his mom and being in a mixed family and just lashing out and those around him and saying something he knows will hurt but i dont actually see anywhere where anyone is even remotely provoking him unless youre going to count the five year old asking to take a look and at that point its time for both parents to step in and address the fact that he needs to have some patience for a five year old,MagicCarpet5846
this is somewhat normal for teenagers even without all the stressors in his life siblings can say some awful stuff to each other but thats when its time for the parents to step in as the adults and guide their growing humans in the right direction,MagicCarpet5846
girl why are you trying so hard to lie to yourself hes already doing a good enough job for you you cant both disrespect yourself this much,MagicCarpet5846
nothing he said is really wrong though you come into a good amount of money the smart move is pay off any interest accruing debt and invest in something else to grow your money,MagicCarpet5846
no one has tried to get their hands on it the step siblings havent tried touching it since op was married six years ago and his half brother alec is a 5 year old and asked to take a look believe it or not but a 15 year old does need to learn some patience for his 5 year old brother its bad parenting to act like his attitude is at all acceptable,MagicCarpet5846
depends is your long term goal to be in a place where you two can be friends or is your long term goal to both be in a place to fully move on with your lives without one another in it if this was taken as the end no i wouldnt if the goal was to get space to get over the relationship so you two could maintain a friendship indefinitely something as simple as no need to reply but i hope you have a nice birthday would probably be fine more likely than not though one or both of you wanted this to simply be the end,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think this is actually meant to convey the idea of what he would do in an emergency its meant to bluntly and hurtfully convey the idea that his stephalf siblings mean nothing to him and hes doing so by conveying that even a lifeless though important object means more to him than them and that sort of needless cruelty from a 15 year old repeatedly to a 5 9 and 11 year old is definitely the sort of thing you can and should step in to address,MagicCarpet5846
if you are afraid of there being a time limit its pointless to even give it one last try hes essentially telling you we need to figure this out because im at the end of my rope and i dont want to leave but i will have to if you cant get it together quickly call it now this probably is hurting him a lot guys are also capable of leaving someone they love that it isnt working with just because hes told you this doesnt mean hes manipulating you it means hes trying to get you to care that youll lose him,MagicCarpet5846
unfortunately at this point unless theres a miracle involved you two are unlikely going to be able to just stop and fix things but it is possible if youre both willing to try and put in the work,MagicCarpet5846
also a reminder it isnt all or nothing he can say i cant pay for everything but i want to help you out i can pay 510kyear towards your tuition which i will pay directly to the school or whatever amount he decides depending on what tuition is like in his country if she freaks out he knows shes just looking for a free ride if shes grateful then maybe they can have at least some semblance of a relationship,MagicCarpet5846
youll get nowhere if you dont accept the fact that your husband isnt loyal doesnt prioritize you and would frankly rather be with someone else i get denial is strong but the only person who suffers from your stubbornness is you not him he gets two women fighting for him someone to put his bills keep his home still have plenty of sex and feel no guilt because at this point you are well aware of who he is and are choosing to stay thats essentially you saying im okay with this in his mind,MagicCarpet5846
youre definitely giving him way too much credit he needs to say the words assistant youre crossing professional boundaries right now you need to stop behaving like this its unprofessional and not okay the fact that hes never shut her down is a problem and it isnt remedied by you simply being sure he wont cheat on you he needs to be ready willing and able to actually tell this woman her behavior is entirely unprofessional and whatever her feelings for him are or are not she needs to learn what it means to be someones assistance in a place of work,MagicCarpet5846
it would be an incredible overreaction if this were the first time an issue with money has come up but it isnt theyve been clashing about their views on money ever since and perhaps even before they pooled their money this isnt just one example of spending money without discussing it its a pattern of disregarding ops wishes failing to communicate stonewalling and mismanaging money the problem is people are human we arent endless wells of patience that never run out after monthspotentially years of trying to get his gf on board with discussing finances and having a plan and her never taking his concerns seriously or even hearing him out hes used up all of his patience on maintaining the status quo that its all gone for anything beyond that and while it can definitely be fixed its hard and it takes both people realizing theyre both going about things the wrong way and seriously changes all around will be needed to fix the gap and resentment thats formed,MagicCarpet5846
all of those concern two babies born to the same generation though this isnt stealing a baby name this is simply using a name and if you really wanted to use the analogy the baby name in this case is hope and the sil would be the one stealing it by trying to make it so op cant use it,MagicCarpet5846
i think theyre acting as though its so distant because op said she and her brother have a strained relationship so it isnt like theyre meeting up for weekly family dinners where theyll realistically always be getting confused its more like having to worry about it during thanksgivingchristmas and even then thats probably not every year if they celebrate with ops family as well so it amounts to the same level of inconvenience as youd have if you shared a name with a distant cousin,MagicCarpet5846
the point is op would only be changing the name to appease sil but if ever her and her partner break updivorce shed have changed her daughters name for someone who was no longer her concern so her priority should be honoring her family rather than respecting sil,MagicCarpet5846
im not moving any goal post everyone else is and theyre moving it down the bare minimum for not in poverty is being able to afford a roof over your head and food on the table bare minimum for middle class is being able to provide enough of a roof over your head and good food and the occasional take out and maybe saving for a vacation bare minimum for upper middle class is being able to afford a nice car a nice home and having savings for retirementeducationrainy day bare minimum for rich is having an excess of wealth that can freely be spent on luxury goods and not having to worry about the costs of any education things like luxury cars privateexclusive vacations mansionmcmansions having the closet of designer clothes newest devices buying your kids houses etc are common place and not a concern for those who are rich and yes the dollar sign it takes to be rich has drastically increased but no the goal post for what being rich means hasnt,MagicCarpet5846
she said itll affect the relationship with her brother not the kid they already dont have a good relationship though so idk why she thinks theyd prioritize an already crappy relationship over that of the mother of the baby getting to honor her great grandmother,MagicCarpet5846
realistically speaking regardless of the name she wasnt going to be very present in the babys life anyway as as it stands shes barely in her brothers life most people dont suddenly invest into the lives of a kid to a person they barely talk to she thinks that statement bears any weight but frankly it makes her argument worse not better as it just illustrates how little they lose by ignoring her wishes and how much they gain,MagicCarpet5846
2 years older shes 22 and dying of stage 4 cancer i get its an adult but i stand by my point,MagicCarpet5846
yeah the price of kids and a good education in the us is no joke and if youre making that much money you really arent getting much if any help for the costs i had scholarships and it still ended up being that much im in a great place in life dont get me wrong but it takes a lot of money to raise kids in an ideal fashion people can of course make it work with way less but anyone who grew up poor can attest its better to grow up with more than less,MagicCarpet5846
well the way i see it rich should be a higher standard of living than what everyone should be capable of not having to live paycheck to paycheck affording retirement vacations and at least somewhat of a college fund are all things i think everyone should be able to comfortably achieve youd need to go significantly above and beyond that basic standard of living to me to be considered rich which i see specifically as an excess of wealth not just enough,MagicCarpet5846
shes practically a child dying of stage 4 cancer to some extent you cant expect her to be rolling in money for a wedding,MagicCarpet5846
youre aware your dad is effectively trying to replace you with his daughters and to pretend like those are the kids he had with his late wife right i dont mean to put a damper here but that would really make me rethink having any form of close relationship with him,MagicCarpet5846
someone that insecure doesnt accept that answer they keep pressing until they get something to fixate on,MagicCarpet5846
yes its a relative term but its one that implies luxury it isnt actually a luxury to have a comfortable life i understand societal factors make it so that is something most for without but it shouldnt be the standard is able to live a comfortable life the problem is so few of us are able to but the standard for what we should be able to achieve didnt suddenly decline just because it got harder to achieve,MagicCarpet5846
i know what its like not to have those savings but that still doesnt change the fact that being able to comfortably achieve a bare minimum doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middleupper middle class depending on if maybe there are some luxuries or if everything is fairly average,MagicCarpet5846
that they are people are severely underestimating just how much more money it takes to go from nice life to amazing life when you also have multiple kids and even intend to pay for half of their education if grad school might be on the table mine was in the midhigh 6 figures all said and done and that was just me,MagicCarpet5846
so middle class is defined as up to the top 83 of earners if we said upper middle class is the next 10 of earners supported by 14 of people reporting they are upper middle class that would be just over 300k of income being up to upper middle class middle class and upper middle class are not the same and upper middle class is beyond the middle class it allows for things like retiring early paying part of your kids education and nice day to day lives but it is hardly rich its just that unfortunately so many people do without what should be way easier to attain,MagicCarpet5846
upper middle class is a shockingly uncommon level of wealth yes and thats because of how much you need to earn to achieve it youre supporting my point 300k with multiple kids and a plan to retire early puts you in the upper middle class not rich,MagicCarpet5846
and for reference i am referring to actual upstate new york as in close to the canadian border for anonymity im not referring to westchester or any area nearby like i said youd be surprised,MagicCarpet5846
no middle class isnt defined on what you earn its defined on your lifestyle thats why more people live in poverty than the bottom lets just say 10 of income earners it works both ways unfortunately there are more people in the lower bracket than the higher but that is exactly why people say the middle class has largely been eliminated if it were just by your earnings definitionally there would always be a middle class that never grows nor shrinks but its clear most people agree that thats not the case its just the unfortunately what it takes to actually be middlemiddleclass in this country is insane now but the two while related are different,MagicCarpet5846
not at all but being comfortable and not having to worry about your bills and being able to enjoy life doesnt mean youre rich it means youre middle upper middle class just because the middle class has larger lot been wiped out due to a lot of societal factors people are discussing doesnt change the fact that that is middle class it just feels like it shouldnt because thats now the top 510 of the country but just like you wouldnt call someone who lives paycheck to paycheck and cant afford a big enough house for their kids or save for retirement solidly middlemiddle upper class just because theyre in the 50 of american incomes you wouldnt call someone living what is a upper middle class lifestyle rich just because of the percentile of income theyre two different concepts people are misunderstanding,MagicCarpet5846
povertylowmiddleupperrich has to do with lifestyle not percentile and thats why way more people live in poverty than those in the bottom 10 of income earners in the us it works both ways,MagicCarpet5846
yeah i think a lot of people here are considering rich to be doesnt need to worry about money for the minimums but it definitely is way more than that id describe can afford a nice home nice cars fill the retirement funds college funds vacation funds and savings as upper middle class at best rich is tons of luxury goods the 1 million dollar closet vacations that cost tens of thousands of dollars and you dont even need to really save for it way more than just a nice life,MagicCarpet5846
everyone i knew who made 250k450k even in upstate ny was still upper middle class money doesnt go as far as you think when it comes to being rich in order to be rich thats more than has a nice house nice car and can pay for their kids school and vacations every year which after taxes thats around the lifestyle were talking about in most places except the rural thats 150k in disposable income after taxes and then youd need to pay your mortgage your cars retirement health insurance which can be well over 10kpp a year put away money for multiple kids college pay for their necessities food etc it definitely adds up and once all that is said and done youre definitely comfortable but youre definitely not rich rich is way less than the top 1 in the us i know that its hard for most to understand because they would feel rich with that much money but thats right up until you have that much and realize how money doesnt really go that far when youre talking about living a luxurious lifestyle which is definitely a necessity if were talking about considering someone rich,MagicCarpet5846
rich is more than just can comfortably pay bills and afford vacations,MagicCarpet5846
true but youre also making the assumption that just because people survive on less means this is enough to make someone rich 300k still makes them upper middle class when you factor in savings the cost of kids taxes college funds retirement funds,MagicCarpet5846
people define their wealth based on the lifestyle they can afford and i can promise theyre living an upper middle class life at best 300k even in san fran isnt enough to have a mansion and eat at nobu every day it may be enough to not worry about your bills but id argue thats middle class not being rich,MagicCarpet5846
he was directly asked a question about it he didnt complain shes just one of the most insecure women out there and was looking for some reason to hate herself part of this definitely falls into she needs therapy for the insecurity otherwise shell ruin any relationship shes in,MagicCarpet5846
you can simply contact the police its your home he legally actually cant lock you out the police will escort you personally while you collect your belongings be sure to mention the fact that hes been abusive in the past and youre afraid of him escalating if you try to get your belongings back,MagicCarpet5846
also i do want to remind you just because your contractions were false doesnt mean hers will be by assuming her experiences will be the same as yours you may be obfuscating a serious health concern that she should go to the hospital for you mean well but you arent a doctor and having 1 pregnancy gives you about as much insight into what might be going on with her pregnancy medically as a man would have and that is to say almost nothing you can sympathize with her discomfort but keep your assumptions on her medical status to yourself,MagicCarpet5846
i think the real question is did he actually stalk you to fabricate your relationship or was that text message just a joke that he sent to friends after he happened to meet you by chance because ive definitely had moments like that happen where ive talked to my friends about something but never actually meant it and then it happened by chance and i joke about making it happen even though i didnt though nothing quite like this,MagicCarpet5846
i can see this being just a series of bad coincidences but if you feel like this man even a bit fabricated your meeting run far and run fast because thats some you level of stalking and obsession,MagicCarpet5846
yeah no casual restaurants that are sit down dinner for an average of 12entree dont operate that way at all,MagicCarpet5846
id probably get divorce papers drawn up and get a plan for a new bedroom being set up and once he inevitably goes to cost her move everything out from your room and into the new space for yourself get a lock and just leave the house and have the papers sitting on the bed and a note saying im aware of how you feel about woman i am not going to be second place in my own marriage whatever you wish to happen between you two youre now free to explore,MagicCarpet5846
and then i would leave for a hotelspa for a night just to make him wonder where you are and also to avoid the immediate reaction hes bound to have,MagicCarpet5846
and its pretty shitty that op and her sibling are putting her brother in a position to need to make that call either way he needs to be unfair to one of his kids unless everyone is trying to imply if you dont share blood you cant consider someone your child,MagicCarpet5846
yeah its pretty terrible of op and aunt imo to put their own sibling in the position of choosing between ensuring his bio daughters future and staying by his chosen family i still think its their money to do with as they please but i personally would go with my brother has two kids if i cant treat them equally i wont treat them especially if stepniece doesnt have a bio dad in her life and sees brother as her father figure but i understand their choice as well,MagicCarpet5846
perhaps he didnt mature he just thought youd changed enough to put up with it this may not be your forever relationship op and thats okay we grow from high school,MagicCarpet5846
i mean if you dont want to see him again dont but i will say as youre describing it that doesnt sound implausible for him to also have had that experience dad jokes arent exactly copy righted and sitting by the tv making a dumb sex joke to your kid sounds like the sort of thing hundreds if not thousands of teens could talk about,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846
see  for more info,MagicCarpet5846
i didnt say i dont know any sibling who choose to i know plenty i just said none who are required to collegeschool is still on the parents not the siblings even if the siblings choose to save up which i will point out they made sure to do so quietly as this is the first time the fund was mentioned to the parents,MagicCarpet5846
i mean niece isnt the familys obligation either no ive never heard of it being on the siblings to pay for high schoolcollege for someone elses kids that in mind they already arent responsible for but are choosing to provide for niece that kindness can extend only as far as they wish in fact its only because its siblings with no obligation that this is okay otherwise id argue if after 10 years youre unable to treat both of his kids like his kids regardless of blood thats wrong,MagicCarpet5846
well because he is clearly at a minimum her emotional apbest friend,MagicCarpet5846
well you see op is acting as though no one will ever be good enough for her little baby boy she seems to have a pattern of ostracizing her sons partners and subtly trying to make them feel less than,MagicCarpet5846
yeah and good for her for respecting herself enough not to put up with that crap and good for her fiancthe son to love her enough to stand up to his mom his mom is giving off major no woman but me is good enough for my son vibes which is a major ick factor,MagicCarpet5846
then start acting like one because youre acting like a misogynist with a jocasta complex towards your son,MagicCarpet5846
this is a troll because you are very clearly not a bot account,MagicCarpet5846
just because the weed itself may not pose a threat thats foolish to think someone who got incredibly and unexpectedly high as a kid wouldnt be in any danger being intoxicated always poses a risk for accidents,MagicCarpet5846
i think they dont mean it literally as if theres no active mods the subreddit will be shut down its against reddit policy to have an unmoderated subreddit,MagicCarpet5846
it honestly sounds like youve decided it cant work and are looking for a reason it doesnt if thats how you feel leave if you dont like this truth get some therapy but this is definitely an internal issue you need to resolve if youre unwilling to actually put in the effort here and stop just defaulting to see look its not getting better then theres no point wasting either of your time,MagicCarpet5846
nta just reply back hey dude i didnt drink more than a fifth of a bottle so im pretty sure my share is covered by the groceries i brought for everyone if you want i can send over an extra 10 but i dont want to start a habit of paying for what i didnt use,MagicCarpet5846
presumably this is student housing where this sort of switching of apartments is common and accepted by the landlord while not how most adult apartment complexes are run its pretty common practice in college towns,MagicCarpet5846
make a choice you made vows do they actually mean something to you or is it just words you said the grass is greener where you water it if you actually believe marriage means something you go nc and start focusing on your wife and your marriage communication compromise and couples therapy if you can afford it thats the only acceptable answer,MagicCarpet5846
he makes you a worse version of yourself why would you stagnate yourself for three years only to stay in a relationship with someone who brings out the worst in you,MagicCarpet5846
no work on yourself heal move on if you two are right for each other youll run into one another in the future but do not plan for it tell him youre not going to wait for him as its clear you two arent right for each other as you are,MagicCarpet5846
why are you throwing and paying for a baby shower for your friend and giving her no hard budget to follow unless im sorely mistaken on how baby showers work thats not normal,MagicCarpet5846
this goes in the face of what a lot of people say but this is also one of those rare times when you really shouldnt communicate to death about this if you need to have one more convo where you two both agree you were both asking for trouble and you will both try to move forward then sure but at the end of the day you asked the question if you cant handle the answer thats a you problem not a him problem and beating this conversation to death is only going to serve to kill your relationship even more stop talking about it after the next conversation either the pain will subside in which case awesome learn your lesson or it wont in which case that sucks but youve learned your lesson on how asking stupid questions can ruin a good thing and then both of you should go your separate ways,MagicCarpet5846
im all for employees not immediately being fired for the smallest of mistakes but i also wish we as a society could move away from the idea that you should be paid for not doing any work and i mean this for the common office worker and the ridiculously overpaid executive that just golfs all day earn your money it isnt that hard,MagicCarpet5846
you keep saying i understand if its because of my tardiness and then proceed to not understand that shes cutting you because of the tardiness and because you are stressing her out and trying to make things about yourself and your feelings rather than trying to make things easier for her which is what being a bridesmaid is actually about,MagicCarpet5846
accept the fact that you messed up and arent in a position to adequately fulfill the role of a bridesmaid and gracefully apologize to her im sorry that i made your wedding about me that was wrong i get why you would be less stressed without worrying about me in the bridal party im still excited to see you get married and i hope you can forgive me because i dont want my bullheadedness to ruin our friendship,MagicCarpet5846
because if you dont accept your mistakes and you decide not to go youll lose this friendship and it will be because youre unable to put your friends feelings on her wedding day before your own yta a large one if i were your friend id be glad if you didnt go so i could quietly bow out of a friendship with such a selfish person,MagicCarpet5846
not only that but im pretty sure op is the mean girl the bride said please just accept my decision and lets move on i know thats hard for you to do which says pretty much everything about who op is as a friend,MagicCarpet5846
and thats before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out op for only caring about herself and not the brides stress and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually op that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower when in reality it was three times during one weekend one time 2 hours late one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event she even needed a plan to get her to show up early to the wedding with someone which means its not just feeling off but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself she also kept saying shed understand if its because of how late she was but then also proceeds to text paragraphs about how hurt she is make half a dozen reddit posts with varying levels of information included to obfuscate her wrongdoings and even flat out denies being late in one of the posts as saying the bride is making it up,MagicCarpet5846
op you need to do some deep reflection here because youre misrepresenting things heavily and someone who cant take accountability and blames others isnt a good friend or frankly a good person you said you would understand if shes cutting you for being late and she obviously cut you for being late so tell her you understand and are still happy she even wants you at her wedding because if it were me i would be glad you were debating not going so i didnt have to figure out how to polite ghost you,MagicCarpet5846
thats fair the few times ive ever needed to sob i wore myself out within like 10 minutes maybe 30 if im assuming i grossly am miscalculating the time but i couldnt even physically imagine sobbingscreaming for 90 minutes and still being able to effectively breathe at that point i get stuffed up and a migraine so quickly when i cry,MagicCarpet5846
also remember if youre basically preparing for them to be unhappy either way might as well wait and enjoy the peace while you can its not like theyll be happy if you tell them early youre just making yourself unhappy all that much sooner,MagicCarpet5846
and in that same strain plenty of addicts need to cope by completely and totally removing their vice from their life if op has moved forward through moving on it may be true that regardless of the amount of progress made now that this friend needs to always remain in the past much like you would never tell a coke addict they can probably handle having coke in their life again it may be a similar situation here its okay to have limitations it doesnt mean you arent reformed,MagicCarpet5846
eh it isnt fair to think people can say thats enough with emotions but you definitely can control if youre sobbingscreaming vs just crying uncontrollably and maybe heavy breathing ive had those days where i cant stop crying for hours at a time but silently,MagicCarpet5846
nta but also you may be shooting yourself in the foot here what does your lease say are you responsible for the rent unless she finds someone else to takeover because if youre on the lease its still your responsibility regardless of if you live there or not,MagicCarpet5846
i mean yeah personally if my partner was considering ending our relationship because of issues especially something legitimate that ive been doing i absolutely want to know who the heck would genuinely say theyd actually prefer to be left in the dark and give up the ability to save their marriage just because theyre afraid of a hard conversation,MagicCarpet5846
pretty much everyone ever that i have known who was blindsided wishes their partner wouldve just said when they were starting to think of leaving so it could be fixed,MagicCarpet5846
good actual communication can overcome way more relationship issues than people give credit to,MagicCarpet5846
ok so talk to her about that you dont see the blatant hypocrisy in your statement youre just as guilty of the same things she is youre trying to leave her in the dark over a huge thought youre having rather than just telling her what youre thinking stop that be better,MagicCarpet5846
yeah if youre that bothered youre updating your facebook status in the bathroom my comment stands op was bothered enough to take action if theyre that easily bothered they arent compatible with small office culture unless youre in a mega corporation generally small offices will have talks like this especially since its incredibly benign to say something along the lines of thank god he was looking out for my husband it isnt exactly a controversial statement even atheists often use that sort of language,MagicCarpet5846
that isnt really true if you cant handle having or even hearing any sort of conversation that isnt strictly about work and nothing else not even something as meaningful as a cancer scare then you need to go work in a giant conglomerate where coworkers arent actually meant to be people and are just meant to be cogs in the machine everywhere else though coworkers are often some form of friends even if its only during work,MagicCarpet5846
believe it or not but it isnt u professional to have a discussion about a coworker you have a relationship with it isnt like they were trying to convert op they were simply discussing their experiences and how they felt luckylooked out for that their husbands mass was found early,MagicCarpet5846
maybe a pea coat or a trench would give you what youre looking for but can still have a fitted waist to give you some shape,MagicCarpet5846
it may just be the dress you have underneath but this doesnt work for me you look like youre drowning in so much fabric,MagicCarpet5846
or even just dont put glasses on the floor theres obviously a side table right nearby im not sure why this is even a habit at all let alone the act of leaving them the issue isnt really her forgetting the glass out because she does all the chores and people are allowed to forget things once in awhile but also just dont put your glass on the floor and then when you forget it out itll be on the table and not a tripping hazard,MagicCarpet5846
or he just got fed up and she refused to take any form of accountability and just shifted blame so he decided to leave im not saying either of them are totally at fault but lets also not act like either of them is totally blameless either id say its way more okay to have a half cup of coffee next to the laptop if youre working in the living room than it is to leave a glass of water as a tripping hazard in the direct foot path of people in the house,MagicCarpet5846
if youre in the wrong for anything its that youre not taking it badly enough thats just how bad it is what he said,MagicCarpet5846
as much as it was obvious he wasnt performing to standard today i also want to remind people he is a real human being and likely is worried about more than just this match with everything going on with kyedae and to keep the flaming to a minimum it isnt going to help him improve and it honestly cant feel good for him to hear people shitting on him everyone has bad days and even if you think hes inconsistent it could be due to his entire world turning upside down within the past month,MagicCarpet5846
ok op you need to realize there is no saving the kids it sucks but both of their parents are literal nazis the kids either will or wont take after their parents but unless youre going to do away with the nazi father which do not im trying to simply illustrate you need to accept the kids will turn out how they are destined to turn out then you need to accept that the kids got fucked with their parents,MagicCarpet5846
reach out to the kids when theyre older if youre so inclined to protect them but at this point you cant do anything you need to just accept tank your cousin is now and stand up for your values,MagicCarpet5846
a little late is definitely 15 minutes not over an hour i would definitely be more than a little annoyed if someone showed up to a meal over an hour late without explicitly stating that theres almost no restaurant ive ever been to where an hour and 15 minutes in i havent gotten and eaten my food already at that point honestly just dont come if youre going to be that late as it defeats the whole purpose of going out for food especially if it was just brunch and not like brunch and shopping or something else afterwards,MagicCarpet5846
that being said the friends still fucked up and glad they took responsibility for it,MagicCarpet5846
im proud of you youve come to this decision a lot easier than most wouldhave it isnt fixable and its ultimately a waste of time that you could spend with someone who actually loves you to even try to fix this just make arrangements for a divorce lawyer and you should legally be allowed to use your joint money to pay but check on your area and serve him with papers make sure to keep a friend or some family in the loop and have an emergency crash on the couch arrangement if you really need just in case if youre able to start applying for jobs or disability or some form of income,MagicCarpet5846
and if he suddenly starts with i want to make this work then you can simply reply if you were ever interested in being a good husband you shouldve done that from the beginning not once ive decided ive had enough,MagicCarpet5846
is there anyone with knowledge who can explain to me how an arranged marriage can happen where the groom and his entire family hate the bride and her family because i still find that part so confusing,MagicCarpet5846
you should speak to a professional theres a lot of things that could be going on and youre right if you dont solve this youll end up either unhappy alone or both a therapist will help if youre willing to put in the work,MagicCarpet5846
has he actually said that though because devils advocate in me thinks theres a chance he also just might have work you still dont need to go ofc,MagicCarpet5846
also consider that youre violating your ex by showing someone else a sex tape of her with her face in full view personally that would be my bigger issue as now id be terrified of any nudes or videos wed takensent being something you either have or might share,MagicCarpet5846
delete everything you have of any other woman on your phone tell her you understand that this was a violation on multiple levels of multiple people and you understand you were a fool and youve gotten your ass handed to you and are never going to do something like that again and then dont because holy shit your poor ex,MagicCarpet5846
1 youre assuming he doesnt want kids and knew he never wanted them that isnt actually stated 2 hes allowed to change his mind hes allowed to withdraw consent everyone is its crazy to argue that because shell lose out on something that his consent no longer should matter imagine making that argument for a woman its gross same thing here morally he can just as easily get a sperm donor or do ivf with a sperm donor and implant that embryo,MagicCarpet5846
well the problem is you didnt tell him because you were afraid of him wanting your money you now know its not a fear its reality you do sound naive because you are failing to realize even if you couldve worked through the issues before you cant and shouldnt work through my boyfriend is a gold digger or potential financial abuser interested in taking or controlling my money,MagicCarpet5846
sure maybe she cant but to be clear theres nothing saying she cant sue and win for the cost of ivf but the answer isnt to take any another persons consent in creating a life that doesnt yet exist,MagicCarpet5846
which is why i said regardless of the legal aspect morally he should be given the right to withdraw consent,MagicCarpet5846
well remember that youve made these changes for yourself and your marriage not to be praised,MagicCarpet5846
it fell off in the house and you noticed within 30 minutes text him and ask for help looking when he comes home at the end of the day if your partner is upset over a one time accident that says more about him than you,MagicCarpet5846
that being said just a tip whenever i put on jewelry with a clasp the first thing i do is give it a little tug to make sure its really on properly and not just appearing to be secured necklaces can be clasped just the wrong way where they stay on but once you tug it it slipped out of the clasp good habit to form to minimize unfortunate accidents but at the end of the day its still just an unfortunate accident,MagicCarpet5846
to be honest i never understood people who say dont accuse someone because for all you know theyre using the condoms for masturbation,MagicCarpet5846
thats pretty uncommon and frankly if thats the case as long as you dont accuse someone like a maniac theyll simply respond to the accusation with the real reason be aware that maybe there are other reasons but thats like someone saying all hooves are zebras unless you live in africa those hooves are horses 999999 of the time,MagicCarpet5846
ok well unfortunately your mistake had a pretty direct hand in turning this dude into a misogynist you can want whatever that doesnt change the reality youre dating a misogynist and not only that but youre dating a man who rightfully resent the woman who allowed him to be bullied when he was less attractive and never stood up for him you arent going to overcome this if youre embarrassed to be with him youd better cut your losses because quite frankly you being in his life is part of the problem because youre a direct confirmation of everything thats fueling him people treating him better as soon as he got attractive,MagicCarpet5846
just to say even if youre legally in the clear morally you should allow this man autonomy over his own progeny i understand there is a cost associated with either getting a sperm donor or doing ivf with someone else but please do not take away his consent to bring his child into the world men and women should be allowed this right sue him for the cost of the ivf and even what it would cost to do it again with a sperm donor but dont bring a child hes clearly stated he doesnt want into the world against his consent,MagicCarpet5846
nta but moving forward upon ordering ask for separate checks not only does that make things way easier for the waiter it makes it clear to lynher boyfriend that whatever they order is fully on them,MagicCarpet5846
its best to learn ways of dealing with difficult people in a way that isnt directly confronting them its unclear if you actually said to the waiter i want separate checks so i dont pay for the other couple but if you did probably best to just address things as i suggested instead because passive aggressive and snide remarks about your girlfriends best friend in front of said best friend without ever saying trying anything else is also not the most mature way of handling things and is bound to rub your gf the wrong way regardless of how in the right you are,MagicCarpet5846
hey its clear youre in denial but you dont need to apologize to us the only one who suffers here is you just remember that,MagicCarpet5846
are you his first girlfriend im going to assume you are or at least youre the first girlfriend to want to have physical intimacy kissing hugging sex etc and he asked you out unaware that he wouldnt like it but he doesnt and hes probably really unsure why himself i would say more likely than not this has to do more with him his feelings his identity and his journey than it has anything to do with you i understand that sucks but i would very gracefully break up with him just send him a text it feels like were friends not in a relationship i think it would be better for us to just be friends from now on,MagicCarpet5846
well if you want the real talk maybe you wont ever be absolutely sure and in that case dont ever get married marriage isnt something you should take lightly and frankly much like children i believe plenty of people out there simply will never be fit for marriage if you cant do it right dont do it not when your decisions can have such huge effect on the lives of others both in the person you would be marrying while unsure and of the kids you may have with her,MagicCarpet5846
id probably speak to a therapist as it sounds like youre struggling with empathy,MagicCarpet5846
well sounds like even if you could trust him before in the past youre no longer able to trust him now as youve caught him in multiple lies,MagicCarpet5846
hes turning into an addict and a liar and when you combined that with the fact that 1 he has additional traits you dont like and dont seem to have touched upon here and 2 youre on reddit asking strangers if you should break up means this,MagicCarpet5846
this isnt the life you want for yourself and you know that this is the life you will have if you stay it sucks because you love so much about him and you wish you could just make him into that perfect person you have in your head but he isnt and as time goes on its becoming harder and harder for you to convince yourself hes close enough to being that person its true that no one is perfect and we all fight and have flaws but the reality is this isnt working and it probably hasnt really worked in a lot longer than you want to admit but the longer you stay the longer itll take to not only get over this relationship but also to find the person who doesnt make you feel this way not only that but staying with someone like this is only going to leave you with issues that make you a worse partner in the future,MagicCarpet5846
all in all he may want to stop but you cant keep waiting around for him to stop even without the drugs probably if you were honest with yourself this wasnt a man that youd want to stay with even if you didnt love him,MagicCarpet5846
im not sure how much this really means if the next most watched game without 4 of the most popular female streamers playing in it was less than 10k viewers,MagicCarpet5846
i also think hes probably putting the blame on the cat when he should be looking at himself,MagicCarpet5846
uimpossiblesign6754 if you are noticing your wife is relying more on a cat than her own husband for emotional support instead of trying to get rid of the cat start asking yourself why you arent the one giving her the emotional support more likely than not youre not actually there for your wife so of course shes going to rely on the cat who is,MagicCarpet5846
you should just tell her im happy to pay for you but anything your sister wants how about you cover yourself good compromise,MagicCarpet5846
they definitely left because they were homophobic not because they were blindsided you can be surprised someone has two fathers but if youre not homophobic your first thought will definitely not be to get up and leave with absolutely no explanation if for no other reason than because you know how homophobic it looks and generally wouldnt want to come off as such i could maybe see this being a topic of conversation after dinner but no semitolerant person storms off like that without even saying anything to the effect of wow i feel like you were purposefully hiding something from me i feel like you may be hiding other things and i dont think its a good idea for us to have a dinner right now,MagicCarpet5846
ok but heres the issue if the money is just meant to be passed along generation to generation no one ever is going to use it right if thats the case 1 the kids shouldnt be upset as it wouldnt have been money they intended to use and 2 thats foolish because hoarding money so you can say you have it but never actually doing anything with it is part of the reason theres so much wealth disparity in the world,MagicCarpet5846
money should be spent responsibly of course but him enjoying the rest of his life and making sure hes able to care for himself is why the money exists if his kids dont want him to rely on them then they shouldnt rely on him to give a full inheritance independence goes both ways,MagicCarpet5846
gunna be honest both of you sound toxic and are trying to hide behind jokes and quick wit when the reality is you are both just bitter and bad partners you probably arent good for each other because and especially neither of you seem ready to be with anyone you cant control him but you can control yourself do some selfreflection and work to undo the unhealthy behaviors youre forming so you can find and keep a partner who will also not treat you like shit,MagicCarpet5846
im also going to add never once have i looked down into my cup and seen anything looking back at me while insulting your family is so far out of line i cant even begin i also cant say i wouldnt also be disgusted if my partner was drinking from a straw with crap growing in it,MagicCarpet5846
maybe tell her its clear this is becoming an issue and you want to discuss this constructively before it causes permanent damage to your marriage so youve booked an appointment with a couples therapist,MagicCarpet5846
if you cant do that are you prepared to be the one putting in 100 of the effort again because those are the options he likes you because you dote on and borderline worship him if you stop doing those things he isnt going to chase after you it sucks but thats the reality pick whatever you perceive as the lesser of two evils,MagicCarpet5846
but just remember as much as you feel like you cant do it you can and the sooner you start the sooner you realize wow how did i ever think losing him was that hard,MagicCarpet5846
dont make yourself miserable because youre afraid of your family thinking less of you its okay to make mistakes its okay to want the best from those you love but it isnt okay to be miserable because youre afraid of potential judgement your family may just be happy youre finally rid of him so dont stay because youre afraid of what others will think if you leave,MagicCarpet5846
i would maybe consider that you also arent who you think you are either im not saying this was your fault but you show a shocking lack of awareness of what id consider the basic status of both your relationship and partners general life its very possible this is all your partners doing but id probably guess you could also do some work on yourself so you can be a better partner in a future relationship with a woman who hopefully will deserve that trust,MagicCarpet5846
i like the pants but the top throws off your proportions you have a wider waist and smaller chest so you probably want a top that creates a more flared illusion sweetheart necklines or even a ruffled top would help to even out your proportions a bit,MagicCarpet5846
well he clearly thought she loved him more than she loved herself,MagicCarpet5846
the unfortunate thing is for at least three years he was right men and women need to remember that if you arent your own priority youre doing something wrong within reason please dont be selfabsorbed just know your worth,MagicCarpet5846
yeah especially since presumably she was dating the exfianc for some length of time meaning this couldve potentially gone down only a few months before they met,MagicCarpet5846
its definitely better for jj oops husband thinks jj is immature for not having a boyfriend thats not the kind of energy i would want in my life everything else not even considered,MagicCarpet5846
not really saying we need to start working on this and making progress because i know this is an issue i cant live with forever but im still willing to work on it now is different than an ultimatum which is effectively make this dramatic change right now or were done,MagicCarpet5846
honestly to answer your question yeah i do think youd be a monster to issue an ultimatum of let me cheat or ill leave you instead tell him i cant stay in a relationship without intimacy we either need to work on this together or we need to reevaluate our marriage because this isnt working for me if he offers an open relationship then sure but to coerce him into an open marriage nah fam if youre unhappy you leave you dont do that,MagicCarpet5846
honestly i think this fit will come down more to your size than your height it looks good because of her figure,MagicCarpet5846
did you ever pause and think maybe your son doesnt respect you two because you dole out a harsher punishment for speaking out against racism than the racism itself,MagicCarpet5846
id say no offense but i actually mean offense when i say if you arent racist get your shit together because youre coming off very racist right now just in the i have a black friend of course im not racist kind of way that 21st century racists all seem to thrive people seem to think refusing to use a slur means you arent racist and trust me its a lot more complicated than that,MagicCarpet5846
most likely because you understand that actions have consequences and anyone can push things too far she likely thought after 5 years they were essentially one so even if he didnt like what she was doing he wouldnt stop it which is a bold choice,MagicCarpet5846
if shes lucky 50k year at 27 with no working history and no info on what her degree would be a godsend,MagicCarpet5846
it never ceases to amaze me how someone can so confidently refuse to compromise because they firmly believe they hold all the power and so quickly backtrack when they realize theyll lose everything over being unwilling to lose anything,MagicCarpet5846
you should really only use force as a last resort you should try bribesmasking before you resort to shoving the pill down their throat,MagicCarpet5846
i dont recommend this but at least in your head say there may be many women who would ask for less but there are also many men who will give so much more,MagicCarpet5846
you deserve better,MagicCarpet5846
yeah im so so so sorry that this is happening to you but its very clear that he thinks youre trapped now there is no changing him and given everything youve just told me i think its most likely he will both cheat and turn physical,MagicCarpet5846
make a decision without him i understand this is hard to come to terms with so if it takes you time to come to the decision thats okay but if you decide to leave him and i would seriously consider it make sure you have everything lined up and never mention a word to him you may need to ask family for help friends make new accounts whatever it takes to ensure he doesnt find out youre honestly very likely in danger right now secrecy is your best friend be careful op if you need resources i can link you to someone who will be able to help more than me,MagicCarpet5846
i also think the title is misleading she isnt actually saying maria cant be vegan but shes saying that maria needs to stop demanding specialty vegan items like fake meat fake cheese fake butter etc if shes vegan on principle good for her but she needs to decide between a plain old saladpasta with tofu or going hungry because its ridiculous to expect everyone else starve and get inadequate nutrition just so maria can have the fancy vegan foods,MagicCarpet5846
make sure to check the reviews i always raise an eyebrow at affordable dresses that require decent construction to look good would suck to waste a couple hundred on a dress that ended up looking cheap,MagicCarpet5846
the reality is your husband wants a traditional wife he wants a woman whos sole existence is to serve him and his family your role is to cook for him take care of him bear and rear as many or as few kids as he desires and put up with whatever he wants he makes a bunch of money and he feels as though thats his right as not only a man but a successful man,MagicCarpet5846
i get everyone on reddit telling you not to tolerate it and you shouldnt but you need to be hyper realistic about the situation youre in he isnt going to change there is no point in trying to convince him if you try to change him one of two i guess three things is going to happen he will leave you cheat on you or become violent hes already become angry with you for beginning to challenge him so do not doubt the possibility that he will become physical,MagicCarpet5846
you need to simply decide if your and his views on what a marriage should be are compatible and they very well may not be but if this isnt what you want you need to make plans to leave not plans to stand up for him otherwise you may be in physical danger or at a minimum left in a situation with no plan he may become vengeful in a divorce and do everything he can to take everything from you and leave you with even less than you came into the marriage with i cant impress upon you that the choices are either accept the marriage he wants or do not say anything until youre in a position to quickly and safely leave,MagicCarpet5846
youd be very wise to involve your father not only for your sisters safety but for your boyfriends safety you need to tell anyone and everyone what your sister is doing and make it clear this isnt consensual and protect your boyfriend because this is how false accusations usually arise your sister may not take the rejection well seeing as any semi sane individual wouldnt tell her sister shes going to pursue her boyfriend of 4 years so youre already dealing with someone who isnt all there when it comes to following social norms be careful and protect yourself and your boyfriend the sooner someone can step in and knock some sense into her the better,MagicCarpet5846
as much as i understand you dont think its weaponized incompetence it is definitely still incompetence i have never ruined a single dinner timer or not because i am paying attention to the meal i would never walk away from a kitchen appliance thats turned on i have never messed up a load of laundry like that because i always check to make sure to fully check hands inside the machine that it is empty before and after a load of laundry ive never had any furniture tvs or anything of the sort break on me because i test to make sure things are installed properly after i finish he cant prevent the actions of others the late drivers and rear end accidents arent him but youre allowing him to blame way more than he should on this nebulous im cursed idea when the reality is he simply isnt going through life intelligently especially because if you know youre that unlucky youll learn quickly ways around it you two have been together years and perhaps even live together if youre eating the same food the fact that you dont get food poisoning and he does probably means he isnt using good food hygiene for the food only hes eating as bacteria doesnt selectively decide to attack him and leave you alone,MagicCarpet5846
this is a classic example of one crappy encounter happens two is unlucky is every encounter sucks the problem is you not them i get it you love him you want to believe this person you love is totally helpless to do anything to stop this unfortunate string of events but he isnt until and unless he understands that hes allowing himself to a victim more than he needs and why given he seems so predisposed to the inevitable and takes steps to course correct youd be fully within your right to leave someone who doesnt understand something so basic as dont leave cooking food unattended that i learned that when i was 8 years old and started cooking,MagicCarpet5846
probably didnt see the context of he was sleeping on an air mattress in someone elses room i was initially thinking he was the ah for making a big deal over 200 but given he doesnt even get an actual place to stay yeah its time to put the foot down imo,MagicCarpet5846
its probably an overreaction to say quit him but i agree op needs to simply put her foot down i am not quitting my etsy store if the time comes where i need to go back to being a waitress i will but being a waitress is a dead end job and one i can get at any time with any resume i am going to put my focus where i am happy and making more money until that changes i understand your concerns so if my business starts to fail ill definitely figure something else out but you do not get to unilaterally tell me to quit my business especially not to go back to waitressing of all jobs its utter ridiculous of you to suggest such a foolish business move,MagicCarpet5846
it likely doesnt take much luck if you a come from a rich family or b have the mother of the child do all of the child care while you focus on school and then your career the kids were all by the same woman it seems you have no idea if that woman was well off or what but its definitely possible,MagicCarpet5846
people seem very unaware that in the franchisedascension league teams are no longer free to make changes whenever they want but yes the rosters are as they are unless there is some emergency transfer allowed by riot which would only be for extenuating circumstances this is a good thing for the scene overall though as rosters that just make a change after any bad performance are going to perform worse than the teams that work at chemistry and accept that the path to success is rarely ever straight up,MagicCarpet5846
to me thats hard to say he might absolutely but he just as easily might not theres 5 teams currently and will be 6 teams by next year im sure changes will be made to franchised teams no doubt but its a combination of depends on what his salary and geographic requirements are combined with what the scene looks like by then a lot can happen in a year in fact yay went from relatively unknown to dominant superstar in less than a year there is nothing to stop that happening again to someone else and based on the trajectory of the scene thus far i actually bet it does happen again the issue is when theres only 30 franchised players and only 56 slots for your particular role it probably isnt a great risk to take saying eh ill just take a year off and come back later because frankly you may not have that option yay has a very particular role he fills with a very particular play style he excels in and he does it well but when youre the best in a niche field you need prominence to ensure relevance and that doesnt happen in a world where he doesnt compete and rarely streams i mean he hasnt even updated his twitch to remove c9 from the about tab and frankly unless yay has a backup plan for his career lined up that isnt a risk id personally want to take when were talking about his actual livelihood here it may not be as glamorous as he would want but it definitely beats becomingstaying unemployed,MagicCarpet5846
well i think people on here in the comments have knee jerk reactions as a result of the people in the posts ignoring numerous red flags the problem is they see where the red flags tend not always of course lead and as a result have a hairpin trigger on convincing people to expect more for themselves and stop ignoring such blatant issues,MagicCarpet5846
however if the people on here were always really intuned with how much these red flags can turn into relationship enders and instead only ever came here for advice on i messed up i forgot my wifes birthday how do i make it up to her or my partner and i disagree on how to handle xyz how do we come to an agreement people would probably be a lot less likely to jump to this relationship is unhealthy you see the issue,MagicCarpet5846
instead this guy is recognizing the dynamic is unhealthy right away and opting out which is the smarter way to go about dating it means that when the issues do arise they tend to be manageable issues and with someone who hopefully will be able and willing to work on those issues with you,MagicCarpet5846
yay wins because he wont be knocked out of the competitive scene for a year ranked is terrible for practicing for pro play and being out of practice with scrims meta and competitive performances could really hurt him in the long run valorant is a game where recency plays a huge role in your value and in a year of franchising with no yay and however many other newupcoming players dominating he could find himself with no prospects again definitely yay has an incentive to be playing and be showing the world he is still very much a top performer compared to all the other talent out there and he does that by competing not by sitting and playing ranked,MagicCarpet5846
well believe it or not most likely the getting all up in his over his eye color had to do with his race her brother getting hostileaggressive could be taken as borderline abusive and ops lack of either a warning about her familys behavior nor any attempt to run interference or set boundariesstand up for him show an unhealthy dynamic that can easily turn toxic,MagicCarpet5846
its not silly for someone to see the red flags for what they are right away and not wait for the silly to turn unbearable in fact if everyone acted the way this guy did people would both be happier in general and also those who refuse to make changes in their lives that would protect their so would be forced to because theyd just keep ending up alone otherwise,MagicCarpet5846
yes and no anger will consume you if you let it learning emotional maturity is learning how to not allow your emotions to rule you and often part of that is learning how to since you seem to like frozen let things go so while yes its a nuanced topic moving on from something does often involve choosing and actively working on not allowing those emotions to control you anymore sure if you think about it you might still feel those things but its semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something in short yes being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to actively feel emotions vs accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life the attitude of she should remain angry forever is frankly unhealthy and lacks any sort of emotional maturity,MagicCarpet5846
she can be angry but she ultimately needs to decide if shes going to let that anger rule her life or not and yes most adults are 100 capable of choosing not to be so angry about something anymore if youre unable to consider you may not have adequate emotional control,MagicCarpet5846
imo it isnt worth it for her to remain angry because the ring was given to her cousin without conditions and regardless of its alterations op wasnt given the ring so there is no additional loss to her as already the ring wasnt and wouldnt be hers it sucks she can mourn the loss of a beautiful ring get it remade for her if she so chooses now free of guilt,MagicCarpet5846
well people can actively to choose to move on from a situation theyre hurt about the point of the comment is a very pragmatic one either make this a hill to die on and cause familial tensions or accept that whats done is done it was technically given to her without conditions of keeping it as is and as much as it hurts that hurt can remain a personal one,MagicCarpet5846
forgiveness is often a choice someone actively makes not one that simply happens and its one that is often made not for the person being forgiven but for themselves yes its hard but part of being an adult is being able to manage your emotions that doesnt mean to just get rid of them but you should be able to manage them enough to be able to move forward,MagicCarpet5846
even the 2030 lbs tvs of today could definitely kill a toddler if it fell the wrong way that poor child but thank god oop lives in a country with strong intervention for at risk children,MagicCarpet5846
i assume the most likely reason for his overreaction was he may be unaware pancada has said he finds playing smokes boring despite being really good at it and thus assumed this was being done against his best interest my guess this was brought up and syyko is enabling pancada in a way even loud wasnt abledidnt want to,MagicCarpet5846
and against any medical practice policies that you wouldnt be horrified to go to even most fast food restaurants say you cant wear a ring if itll risk tearing your gloves yet op thinks a cardiologist should have worse hygiene than a burger king,MagicCarpet5846
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MagicCarpet5846
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MagicCarpet5846

i mean if you really want to be real the problem is she accepts it,MagicCarpet5846
unless i missed something i think ultimately the friend simply isnt going to attend op didnt say anything to me that came off as trying to force her to attend without hans just that she cant attend with him as it would make it so the mother of the groom wouldnt feel comfortable attending her own sons wedding,MagicCarpet5846
right and as long as op isnt forcing the friend to come without the dog and accepts the friend simply will be unable to attend all is well but its completely fair for op to say i fully understand you cant be without hans unfortunately my mil is uncomfortable around even the most well behaved dogs due to her own trauma as much as i would love to have you there i wont ask either of you to be uncomfortable can we celebrate together the four of us you me hans and groom on our own,MagicCarpet5846
in public yes 100000 but this isnt public this is a private event where she isnt required to attend if she doesnt feel comfortable going without her service animal she shouldnt but to act as though her being able to attend comes before making sure her husband can have his mom at his own wedding is also an odd take i for one would really be second guessing a marriage where my stbw made it so my mother wouldnt attend my wedding,MagicCarpet5846
she is nta for ensuring her husbands mother feels comfortable at her wedding over her friend however unfortunately this means the friend should simply not go to the wedding its unfortunate but the friend is not required to go to the wedding and her presence isnt a priority compared to her husbands mother,MagicCarpet5846
uhm yeah actually your post aside it can 100000 be rude to tell someone something objectively true for example you look really fat in that dress can both be objectively true and rude af to say to someone even your tone can take something from being not rude to rude like id say your attitude was for example hey id prefer to go to the movies alone if thats okay but we can have dinner after vs really you cant possibly think id want to go to the movies with you im going alone its true you dont want to go with that person but the first is polite and the second is rude,MagicCarpet5846
no you may feel you have to move now because youd prefer to run alone if the option is there but definitely understand that thats a choice youre making not being force to make and you can make that choice silently if you feel uncomfortable fine but no one else needs to hear why youre moving just move,MagicCarpet5846
she most definitely accosted him you can feel she was justified in doing so and therefore isnt an ah for it but she was 100 accosting him for using the treadmill next to her,MagicCarpet5846
in the future dont say anything just silently move to another treadmill on the off chance that this guy has unrelated reasons for using that particular machine it prevents you from acting rude and even if he did want to impose on you moving without the confrontation will just annoy him and keep you safer,MagicCarpet5846
i would say if he made a complaint as is youd be partially in the wrong as he does have a right to use the equipment regardless of if there are other machines free without you acting like he was doing something wrong and guys like that are definitely the type to make a complaint so its better to just get up and move rather than confront it either wasnt on purpose in which case confronting him is an ah move or it was on purpose and youll convey the message loud and clear without ever having to interact win win,MagicCarpet5846
why not just have your sister text her and see if it goes through on her end thats a pretty surefire way to know if shes blocked you,MagicCarpet5846
that is not true at all that was true in the peak of covid which is no longer really a concern its a tourist economy the lack of tourism is hurting a number of the locals and the ask was strictly because the hospital infrastructure isnt equipped to handle large influxes of inpatient care and being an island in the middle of the ocean alternatives for those who need it is effectively impossible,MagicCarpet5846
its 30 not 50 theres 14 guests  opgroom and i assume theyll have a slightly nicer setup for themselves as itll double as a honeymoon so 2116  13125 an 30 increase if you assume opgroom dont splurge on themselves and if you assume a linear ppp which most likely shed do a double bed and couch setup for the sister and family making it less than other guests which are presumably primarily couples,MagicCarpet5846
doesnt change it the flights alone on a last minute trip to hawaii are nuts and why spend that much money you 1 dont havedidnt plan on and 2 on someone who really isnt there to celebrate your relationship just wants a free trip,MagicCarpet5846
im sorry for not inviting you i figured since you said no due to time away from work and difficulty handling the long travel time with the kids that a longer and harder to get to location would be the opposite of easier for you guys but id still love to have you if youre able to join i can send you the flight and hotel details unfortunately you will need to cover your travelaccommodations as the plans i made were based on those who rsvpd yes only and weve already used our budget if you cant spend the money or the time due to it being your busy season i more than understand and hopefully we can get together once things settle down for us both more if you need to think about it no worries just be sure to let me know by whatever date you want so i can make sure to get extra tickets for the activities i planned,MagicCarpet5846
your bosss success compared to his bosss doesnt have anything to do with the idea that your potential ex may try to sabotage your career,MagicCarpet5846
you can also give him some benefit of the doubt especially because you still come to the same conclusion if hes being caused such deep emotional distress that hes ask you to quit your job after seeing just how low you were at one point that means you are just as unhealthy for him as he is for you at that point even if hes being totally genuine in his feelings the conclusion is the same i love you and i dont want to keep hurting you but if itll take me quitting my career for you to not be hurt unfortunately at this point its for the best we part ways we both have our demons and it seems like they cant play nice with each other im not giving up my job but i also will not stick around and trigger you either please get some therapy its a life changer if our paths cross one day and were both in a place to lift one another up maybe things will be different but for now i think i should move out so you can focus on yourself and your well being,MagicCarpet5846
i hope it isnt true but that was my thought as well either that or im unfortunately guessing he probably isnt the cleanest person to live with because i would definitely notice and clean up any blood left on the floor regardless but especially if caused by something i was ashamed of,MagicCarpet5846
i have no agenda and a number of oops comments have been deletedremoved and show a very different side of oop he was attacking anyone who disagreed with him insulting them and doubling down on the idea that family should come first after being criticized by multiple people it seems his attitude has softened significantly which is good but multiple people on a number of threads have said the same thing the repeated use of the language blood family should come first and calling an obvious abuse victim spineless doesnt sit right with many people the point is the repeated context in which it was used felt less like you shouldnt allow yourself to be manipulated and more like you should simply side with family because were blood and were here first including in the first few comments that were made on this thread thankfully oop has admitted the wording was wrong and emotions were high but i stand by my statement both generally and in the way many felt it was being used in this context and understand you likely didnt see many of oops earlier comments in this thread as he appeared to be deleting them when they werent well received,MagicCarpet5846
fair always is dangerous language however i believe that when you take a marriage vow you need to be prepared to make that person and family you make together your priority over your blood family,MagicCarpet5846
i stand by what i say fully it is disgusting to say you think blood family should be the priority its completely fair to say you think his values which clearly his fiance was in direct opposition to should be his priority but how you phrased it is something i disagree with extensively i fully stand by that dont double down on the context as that only implies you do think blood family takes precedence over a life partner which when that life partner is actually in alliance with you is 100 a disgusting statement,MagicCarpet5846
quite honestly you honestly seemed to have an air of blaming your brother for not sticking with you simply on principle without recognizing the complexities of abuse and that makes can still be victim to toxic relationships im sorry that youre upset i take issue with that but i do,MagicCarpet5846
thats good you recognize that a healthy partner should always come before blood family the way you wrote that post definitely indicates otherwise im glad your brother was able to see reason and get out of an unhealthy relationship,MagicCarpet5846
as much as oop was right that this woman wasnt right for hisher brother im surprised no one has pointed out the idea that blood family should always be the priority over your fiance no matter what is also a disgusting view assuming you and your future life partner are aligned in values you should 100 always pick your life partner over blood family the idea that your sibling should be a priority over a life partner in cases other than such extreme hatred isolation and abuse is horrendous and based on how many times oop brought up the idea of he should stand by his blood family makes me feel like this isnt extenuating circumstance and oop just believes this is what you do i hope oop changes their mind before getting into a ltr if theyre interested in them because my heart hurts for all the people out there in unhappy marriages because their partners hold them in second place to mommydaddywhoever else in the name of family,MagicCarpet5846
sure but that will probably become apparently relatively quickly and can be addressed then as long as youre not depriving your child of any form of food for months seems like a fine strategy to at least try,MagicCarpet5846
i read this as crows initially and had to zoom in in order to definitely say those definitely are not crows,MagicCarpet5846
i mean realistically speaking thats because if a partner was going to negatively talk about body count its going to be towards a female i would be more surprised if i saw someone judging a man for sleeping with 100 girls in college quite honestly,MagicCarpet5846
generally speaking it gets around when youre all friends in college,MagicCarpet5846
you should probably read again i said this isnt a legal issue specifically where it pertains to her lying and saying he raped her i never said sexual assault isnt illegal i was specifically replying to the idea he should report it to the police for fear of her flipping the narrative,MagicCarpet5846
he honestly isnt working that much yes its a lot but plenty of people do it the real issue is hes leaving for work at or around 12 pm if a 1213 hour day has him home at almost 2 am depending on her work hours that means they probably never see each other he needs to get his hours in check and start working wayyy earlier so that him and his wife can share meals together but honestly i have no sympathy for someone who expects his wife to work 30 hours a week do all the chores and then stay up past midnight to have a home cooked meal ready for him in the middle of the night,MagicCarpet5846
this would be a totally different story if he was getting up at 5 am and getting home at 79 pm and expecting her to cook something quick or have take out or whatever but these timeframes are totally unreasonable and unnecessary,MagicCarpet5846
to be honest the part everyone seems to be overlooking is if hes coming home at 130 am after a 1213 hour day that means hes leaving for work at noon he needs to start going into work at 67 am and getting home at a normal hour so its reasonable to expect a meal ready for him but its ludicrous to be going into work that late staying that long and still expecting your wife to stay up past midnight to then cook,MagicCarpet5846
if he were coming home even at 9 pm i would be fully on his side coming home at almost 2 am fuck no,MagicCarpet5846
im not saying it isnt im just saying this isnt a legal issue re she could lie and say he raped her no sex happened in the us actual rapists with evidence go free but you cant have evidence of what didnt happen and unfortunately even though he was sexually assaulted male victims have even less chance of legal success than female victims however filing the report will at least substantiate ops experience even if no consequences befall her,MagicCarpet5846
and like i said if ops girlfriend doesnt believe him even after he has gone to her multiple times then hes learned a valuable lesson about how she prioritizes him so he can gtfo,MagicCarpet5846
she could but since op was smart and went to gf about this before its consistent this wont be a legal issue sex never happened he got a bj and without any evidence of any sex let alone nonconsensual sex op really doesnt need to worry about a rape charge not in the us at least if his gf doesnt believe him ultimately its better for him to know she isnt someone who will have his back and he can leave,MagicCarpet5846
the staff didnt side with her and theres nothing about anyone else agreeing it was simply she had an attitude i had one back the staff told us we were both able to use the equipment as we wished unless you see information not im the op but how youre portraying it is very different than how the op portrays things,MagicCarpet5846
you do seem to be dragging your feet a bit on the legal side of things just to warn you that could seriously hurt you in the long run just be careful,MagicCarpet5846
i mean if communication is important to you i wouldnt stay with someone who doesnt communicate i get it sucks but that just isnt who she is you should love someone for who they are not who you want them to be,MagicCarpet5846
yes i agree but also recognize that there are some people who take undue offense to what most would consider normal so as much as it may depend on him recognize that it doesnt all depend on him this is so much an issue where women assume the worst of guys in the gym where its a growing trend on tiktok for girls to film and watch for anyone who glances at them just to start a fight its entirely possible that she may have also just assumed he was staring at her when he wasnt im not really speculating who was doing what because theres ultimately no way to know except that even if he were standing too close for her preference in a gym environment or really any if you come at someone with an attitude like she did you should expect an attitude in return it really isnt an abnormal social interaction,MagicCarpet5846
even if you regret it in the future you can mourn him then theres no reason or expectation that mourning a life can only occur at a funeral with people to watch you grieve if you dont want to go now dont and whenif that ever changes decide how you want to remember him then,MagicCarpet5846
let him blame you at the end of the day if him blaming you is what it takes for you to find a bigger better relationship far away from a cheater like him thats a small price to pay,MagicCarpet5846
i mean i dont necessarily think its sincere but i am saying that if you immediate attack anyone even trying they will stop trying,MagicCarpet5846
thats fair enough i will say i take it you were probably a bit more polite than it seems the woman in the story was but youre totally entitled to your opinions and experiences i think to me ops answer seems a bit more normal as i get the impression the woman also had an attitude to start and you tend to get what you give so i dont really find op an ah for responding to an attitude with an attitude but im glad you havent had that experience,MagicCarpet5846
no she said she was convinced her intentions were good and realized they werent and her actions came from a place of judgment which was wrong,MagicCarpet5846
yeah it is glaring obvious who does and doesnt go to the gym in this thread to the surprise of no one most people on aita clearly are not avid gym goers,MagicCarpet5846
out of curiosity do you go to a busy gym because youre totally entitled to your opinion but its 100 normal expected and required in a busy gym to stand close enough to a desired piece of equipment that as soon as the person gets up from their set they can move up and take the equipment otherwise someone will take your place this comes down to if the woman isnt comfortable with that sort of environment thats totally fair but she probably needs to go either at a less busy time or a smaller gym,MagicCarpet5846
also im not trying to attack you im just curious if youre familiar with this sort of environment because i can see how someone who isnt familiar with busy gym etiquette may get to your conclusion,MagicCarpet5846
tbf if everyone in the thread is mischaracterizing his actions as something they clearly werent he can provide clarification people are out here acting like he was standing over glaring heavily and making tut tut noises while pointing at his watch when this sounds like completely normal gym interactions from someone who actually goes to a gym heads up gyms are filled with adrenaline and testosterone and women and men tend to be a bit testier than usual women often assume that everyone is leering at them and tend to want space and no one looking at them and men often just want the person theyre waiting on to get out of the way so they can do their set it sometimes leads to snarky interactions and its not that deep,MagicCarpet5846
they didnt actually they said they understood where op was coming from but shes allowed to do whatever exercise wherever she wants thats actually the opposite of saying hes out of line thats retail worker speak for i fully agree with you but this is my job and i need to not get in trouble,MagicCarpet5846
and believe it or not youre allowed to silently judge people he didnt say anything stop acting like you can police someones thought thats some orwellian bullshit right there,MagicCarpet5846
youre gunna decide a person is an asshole for a silent thought dude thats just unreasonable the woman spoke to op first and told them to go away pretty sure op isnt the ah here,MagicCarpet5846
i mean she has a point though as far as i was a giant flaming asshole and now i realize it goes she got further than a lot of people ever do none of these comments recognize that though id probably caution people at least in their real life to be kinder to people who have any form of selfreflection because the fact that this person still got piles of hate for acknowledging they messed up just makes people never want to acknowledge their flaws to some extent she cannot undo what she did she can only reflect on her previous actions and try to learn from it in the future if we actually want the world to be a better place and for people to want to be better we all need to encourage people for trying that doesnt mean forgive their previous mistakes but endlessly hating on someone even when theyre trying to reflect on their behavior isnt the answer,MagicCarpet5846
yeah and then you realize really quickly someone who really loves you wouldnt hold you back and theyd probably move with you given he has nothing tying him to where he is i get how it feels but take it from an old curmudgeon like me you realize a lot of the things you were so sure of at 18 just arent true by the time youre 25 and then again when youre 35 youll find someone who loves you so much you never find yourself posting on reddit about how theyve made you feel guilty for achieving greatness,MagicCarpet5846
ive lost loves before that felt like i wouldve died without them but im still here and in the end i now realize those loves were there to teach me something and prepare me to be the person i was meant to rather than to accompany me in the journey but youll find that person i promise the road may be bumpy but itll be worth it,MagicCarpet5846
i think you should just be honest im going to great school you can either come with me or you can stay but i am going if this is where our paths diverge i can honestly say i loved every minute but i am not giving up on this dream i understand if you arent ready for this step but i am,MagicCarpet5846
i was in a similar situation many years ago i have no regrets and id pick my education every single time my parents always said if its meant to be itll work out and if it wasnt meant to be it isnt worth sacrificing your future for,MagicCarpet5846
does he have a therapist knowledgeable in addiction if not that should be the first step,MagicCarpet5846
sounds like she figured after 3 years marriage should be the next logical step but she realized that wasnt what she actually wanted it could be someone else it could be she wasnt ready it could just be that you two arent right for each other it doesnt mean you were a bad partner or theres anything wrong with you but not everyone is meant to marry each other be happy she realized and finally told you before the wedding rather than after and im glad youre okay,MagicCarpet5846
sometimes just the threat of it would be enough to get someone to back down,MagicCarpet5846
well it would probably be easier to trust if you waited to trust until someone has proven they are worth it ya know then you wouldnt constantly be having dudes breaking it youd just be weeding out the bad eggs without feeling like its a person affront,MagicCarpet5846
like i said before a person who when angry responds in a way to cause pain isnt marriage material you should aim for someone who even when angry is able to come at a conflict from a place of love,MagicCarpet5846
you have time take a breather moving forward table any serious discussion of marriage engagement moving in etc until you feel like you actually know a person and there arent any massive flags thrown out if this is about a rush to the aisle youll end up there a lot quicker and only once if you take your time and make sure its right the first time,MagicCarpet5846
plenty of mcdonalds are 24 hours still weird but possible explanation as to why no one checked,MagicCarpet5846
girl youre a doormat stop believing what this therapist has to say and get your own therapist to work on your issues because youre about to be a mom and you need to work on your spine unless you want to get completely run over by the two kids youre about to have to raise on your own,MagicCarpet5846
as soon as you realize he doesnt actually care about your feelings he only cares about his you should stop caring about how much you love him because thats meaningless to him,MagicCarpet5846
fair enough good luck you seem to have a habit of rushing into situationships with men before you actually know if theyre worth the time investment id recommend slowing down and not jumping in head first with any guy who shows interest,MagicCarpet5846
i do have to ask how many men are you dating and why are you talking about marriage to a man you arent even faithful to you made a post 4 days ago that youve since deleted about a wealthy older indian man wanting to date you and you were considering it expect he was married before i feel like youre going through something but none of the information youre giving is actually honest as theres a common theme of you wanted to be the first wife,MagicCarpet5846
its ok to admit you cant move past it ive said it before and ill say it again never stay in a relationship with a person who when angry will say something just to hurt you that isnt who you commit to a lifetime with it shows theyre vindictive and cruel and neither are traits you need in a partner ive been angry before really angry i have never said to a person whom i intended to continue dating anything that i felt would hurt them just because i wanted to hurt them,MagicCarpet5846
you should both recognize youre career oriented and neither of you should give up your career goals for the other but those goals are in direct contradiction geographic incompatibility is a real thing and residency is long hard and time consuming if you think long distance relationships dont work let me tell you relationships in residency also dont usually work if you combined long distance and residency its a whole other beast to tackle if you already have doubts it aint worth it to invest another 23 years just to find out what you already know,MagicCarpet5846
youre in your final year of uni when do you graduate are you done in mayjune if so hold off until you graduate itll give you time to plan and get the logistics sorted start applying for jobs now either where you are or back home where your family is go to your universities career department to get in contact with alumni message recruiters on linkedin this all works way better than blindly applying network network network use being a student to your advantage there is no easier time to get a job than now,MagicCarpet5846
as for how to get where youre going do you have a drivers license if so rent a car to get where youre going you can possibly take your bird on a train cover the bird during travel and get a travel cage that can fit either at your feet or on the seat next to you be realistic about how much it costs to transport things it may be cheaper to replace items than ship them i moved cross country twice in a very short period of time and the only thing i transported was clothing everything else was bought as cheap as possible and given to friends when i left vacuum bags are your best friend for getting as much as you can in your bagscar,MagicCarpet5846
if you dont have a license but do have family willing to house you pay for a ticket for them to fly out and then rent the car to transport you and your stuff in the meantime you need some income look into on campus jobs the dining hall library cafes tutor centers etc all should have flexible hours and be okay with you working 515 hours a week for some pocket change save every penny work as much as youre able,MagicCarpet5846
focus on 1 getting a part time job on campus if possible 2 getting a permanent job network network network 3 talking to family to see if they can help you and how 4 looking into how much it will cost to get where you need to go the further you have to travel the more it will be and ultimately make sure you dont try to take a bunch of stuff that will be cheap to replace but expensive to transport,MagicCarpet5846
im going to go against the grain but i would be uncomfortable if my partner went out in clothing like that personally nips showing for me are a no go and its pretty clear there were some nips showing its your body you are 100 in your right to do whatever you want but hes also allowed to be uncomfortable with it after 5 years together id personally expect my opinion to matter a bit to my partner i think you probably should decide if this is the hill to die on and if it is go forth but i wouldnt think wearing a shirt with no braundershirt or jacket or anything is worth making my partner feel as though youre looking for other mens attention i think youre nta but i get where hes coming from you clearly dont need to be with a guy who is uncomfortable with clothing like that though either ultimately may just be an incompatibility in your views,MagicCarpet5846
info do you actually have a choice because based on your description youre third in line after your grandparents and your aunts to get the land unfortunately if this is the case speak to a lawyer before responding because legally this might be the best youre actually going to get that doesnt make it right but you should get this info before deciding how to proceed because if you dont have leverage here legally youre going to need to proceed accordingly it honestly sounds like your family is legally entitled to take 100 of your inheritance if theyre so inclined and you wouldnt have any recourse if you irk them they may go this route,MagicCarpet5846
im fairly certain she isnt using an account with a 120 balance in it to provide the cash to close last i checked you need a lot more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so theres obviously another account somewhere,MagicCarpet5846
again i do not you seem not to realize that apple has embedded software in the photos app that changes the video attributes when you copy a file this is exactly what was discussed by professionals and exactly why i said unless its an original the metadata is useless have a good day now,MagicCarpet5846
again that is incorrect like i said this was key information in a public trial last year where multiple professionals said copying a file does not save that exact information date time location etc on iphones unless a file is the original the metadata isnt usable im not going to argue any further i will take the experts opinion over a random redditor,MagicCarpet5846
looks super cute but needs a fun belt or even a flannel tied around the waist as it is its missing something but it definitely works,MagicCarpet5846
i do youre referring to the date with which a video was physically taken ie the day that ops gf was having sex if the video isnt the original which would track in her story the metadata wouldnt be in tact granted i believe you can tell if the video is an original if youre a forensic technician but laymen are unable to tell what youre trying to say the metadata will say,MagicCarpet5846
copying a file alters the metadata simple as that and like i said before ill take a paid professional with a decade of experience and tons of lauded credentials saying this in a court of law over some rando on reddit contradicting it,MagicCarpet5846
this was a key point in a very public trial that involved forensic metadata experts and these were the conclusions they all drew if the files werent original the metadata would not be intact ill go with their expert opinion over yours thanks,MagicCarpet5846
eta this was jd v ah where the fact that metadata couldnt be verified in copied files is what hurt her on top of everything else but thats not relevant here,MagicCarpet5846
i think you missed the point is she able to financially bring the same as you do in the relationship is she willing to have an even financial split or is she looking for someone to take care of her what do you want do you want an equal partner or are you okay with being with someone who you need to care for,MagicCarpet5846
what sources are you using because while its true that often these are compromises made in relationships at your age they are by no means necessary to find a relationship so long as and especially if youre willing to wait until you find someone who feels the same way as you in fact you have a lot of the conclusions it takes people another decade or so to come to so good for you realizing this so soon,MagicCarpet5846
i will remind you that even with a healthy mindset relationships can fail but that doesnt mean the relationships werent worth it or didnt teach you anything so while you should properly vet women before committing to them try to loosen up on the disgust because things not working out being what you thought and all of this is a big pet of growing up and somewhere along the way its likely that exactly what you want in a partner will change and evolve as a result of these experiences and thats a good thing growth and experience isnt a bad thing just remember that regardless of what happens if you can learn something from it it was worth it,MagicCarpet5846
thats only if the file is original otherwise the metadata would show when the copy was created ultimately he either trusts her or he doesnt and i would understand him not being able to trust her,MagicCarpet5846
ive definitely had this happen if all youre referring to is the date it says when you click on the video sometimes its smart enough to know when the photovideo was actually created and other times it just is whatever the date i saved the videophoto,MagicCarpet5846
funny because i expect it will go exactly as she expects sex work is a hard line for a lot of people and hes conservative it doesnt take a genius to figure out more likely than not hes not going to marry someone who was a sugar baby it sucks but 1 this is why its important to choose someone who have values compatible with you and your life and 2 the sugar daddy has her number its clear that he isnt above searching her up as soon as he realizes shes married itll come out and its way better for her to get broken up with now 2 years and no commitments in rather than divorced in a few years when theres a house marriage and kids on the line,MagicCarpet5846
we all make choices in life as much as i believe people can change sometimes those choices will always have consequences but its better to be with someone who accepts everything about you rather than be with someone who you know would leave you if they knew the real you like you said i knew if i told you you would have left shows just how selfish a person really is and frankly means they probably havent really changed as much as they tell themselves,MagicCarpet5846
if it helps tell yourself youre also going this for her she needs to be able to sort out her relationship issues without you in the picture and its clear that unfortunately youre a stressor,MagicCarpet5846
and you get the added bonus of doing this for you too because no one deserves to be harassed or name called and remember this isnt your fault,MagicCarpet5846
okay but stop explaining it and justifying it this is what hes going to do he wants to live with his mom and he wants you at 23 years old to support his mom and him remember easier to leave a mommas boy than divorce one hes a mommas boy you arent going to change that he isnt ever going to pick you over her this is the reality instead of wasting all of your energy justifying explaining and defending what you know spend your energy figuring out what you actually want to do is this a life you want youre on reddit looking for advice so clearly some part of you is fed up i would be honest with yourself if you really think this dude is worth a lifetime of being second place you got together at 1517 ill let you in on a little secret the guys youll find now as a fully independent woman with the world at her feet will be a million times better than the guy you found when limited to your math and english lit classroom youre in the prime of your life at the ideal age to find a way better partner both on paper and in how he treats you know your worth,MagicCarpet5846
for both of your sake walk away now you still love her so maybe your relationship will heal but if you keep letting her in your life the friendship will sour even more than it has not only will your presence bring up some obviously repressed issues in their relationship but the chances are someone is going to say something unrecoverable neither of them is ready to deal with the fact that dude isnt straight take a step back if you love her let her sort her relationship as youre clearly putting strain on it if you love yourself take a step back because youve been groped and harassed repeatedly and you dont deserve that you do not ever need to accept someone making you feel unsafe i wish you luck i hope she realizes how shitty shes being but do not stick around as if you do youll always be the scapegoat i speak from experience walking away is the best thing for everyone involved,MagicCarpet5846
keep in mind and im not defending her at all she needs to come to terms with her boyfriend being predatory unfaithful and at least partially a different orientation shes probably struggling with the reality of what she just witnessed actually means and thinks its easier to blame you than deal with things,MagicCarpet5846
this isnt right this isnt your fault you need to drop her because this isnt right but maybe in the future shell get her head out of her ass and apologize because every one of us including her knows that youre telling the truth and youre not making a mountain out of a molehill shes just hoping she can make a molehill out of a mountain because she doesnt want to accept her relationship is over its up to you if you ever want to entertain a friendship ever again no one blame you if you dont but its pretty clear shes heavy in denial,MagicCarpet5846
this is your life you only have one it is yours to do with as you please if you want to stay stay if this is who you really want to spend your life with thats a choice you can make but remember no one else should have any say in your life because at the end of the day you need to live your life no one else this guy cheated on you call a spade a spade he lied to you fucked other people manipulated you and got others around you to manipulate you too,MagicCarpet5846
stop saying he technically did nothing wrong he did he knows it and you know it if he didnt do anything wrong are you telling me lying isnt wrong because he lied to you every day he told you you were the only one its foolish to keep writing things off if hes still unwilling to say i lied i knew what i was doing was wrong and i lied because i knew youd leave otherwise then theres nothing to even save,MagicCarpet5846
to be fair op seems to have things confused it wouldnt be her leaving if she crosses the boundary itll be him leaving it seems like hes making baseless threats and she knows it hopefully op is prepared to actually walk away otherwise hes setting himself up for a very dark future,MagicCarpet5846
well actually plenty of nutritionists do advocate for intermittent fasting so the idea that her skipping breakfast means she doesnt understand balanced eating is also absurd its actually a rather old take that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and now theres a much better understanding that nutrition isnt a one size fits all and what works for some might not work for others,MagicCarpet5846
that being said yes they cook together and she said she monitored the calories and was still gaining weight given that she ruled out medical concerns it would lend itself to he may be doing something while you arent look unfortunately there have been a few posts of feeders who have purposefully made special condiments with huge amounts of calories to stealthily add to their partners meals not saying i really think thats whats happening here but i am saying i dont think op has all the info here,MagicCarpet5846
while i understand what youre saying she did minutely track her calories so she clearly does understand just how many calories are in what shes eating as nowadays people use an app where you just look up the item and amount and even while tracking she wasnt losing weight which would indicate he may have been doing something to her food while she wasnt looking,MagicCarpet5846
arranged marriages across continents is just plain risky i understand your faithculture but speak to a match maker or at the very least limit yourself to people you can actually meet in real life,MagicCarpet5846
the nature of an arrangedaccelerated marriage like youre discussing is going to lead to people ditching you as soon as they think they may have a chance at an even slightly better prospect which realistically thats my guess what happened,MagicCarpet5846
thats probably unlikely to be an option he has no leverage his dad can pretty easily say marry her before you start the next year or i wont pay tuition,MagicCarpet5846
do so with the primary goal of you arent giving up your children and you arent allowing them to move anywhere far away i assume that especially being well off half a house and half your savings account isnt worth losing your 4 kids right because ultimately shes never getting child support if she has more money and you have your kids half the time so telling you she wont ask for child support is just emotional manipulation at that point because it wouldnt be something she would get anyway as you dont want her to have primaryfull custody,MagicCarpet5846
just a heads up there are a lot of people who actually stay with someone they know will be vindictive if they break up because theyre afraid in the back of their head of facing the vindictive ex and figure its easier to deal with whatever the relationship brings,MagicCarpet5846
yes but she specifically said she was looking forward to them cooking together more often not him cooking for her so youd generally think that that means she can see what hes doing and if shes an athlete she would understand that shit ton of butter means shit ton of calories,MagicCarpet5846
i totally understand most people dont understand how many calories are in fats like butter but i would expect more from someone who says she eats healthy and is an athlete of a decade,MagicCarpet5846
well elaborate on the conversation be blunt we met when i was getting out of a sexless marriage im afraid this is a sign our marriage is taking the same direction i hope im wrong but as my husband its both of our responsibility to discuss this as a couple if youre stressed we need to work on things together because i am not prepared to stay in a relationship where excuses run rampant and i feel tossed to the side im happy to work with you but this is something we actually need to talk about,MagicCarpet5846
you two werent married he didnt commit to stay through thick and thin you both committed some acts that would warrant the other ending the relationship name calling is a pretty fast relationship killer and you  said you have a pattern of namecalling now that isnt to say he was an amazing partner he also wasnt but just because you stayed in a shitty relationship doesnt mean he is under any obligation to i think people get this twisted idea of if i stay when you suck you need to stay when i suck but no putting up with bullshit doesnt buy you the ability to also act like that,MagicCarpet5846
you two clearly never had a fantastic foundation for a relationship and that might be because the two of you dont mesh well or it might be because thats just how he treats the woman hes with either way as much as it hurts be thankful because this wasnt the right guy for you and its pretty obvious you werent going to end it he bit the bullet for you both and did what everyone else can see was the right call it sounds like he honestly never liked you very much and you always put up with less than you wanted because you thought you could convince him to change for you heads up if you tie your self worth into being able to convince shitty men to treat you better because youre worth it youll always be disappointed get your own therapist learn to love yourself outside of how a man treats you and then reflect on what you want in a relationship and find someone who is naturally like that as soon as you need to convince someone youre worth being treated well they arent worth your time,MagicCarpet5846
there are definitely other issues going on here you sound like you may have some body image issues and he may sound like hes doing something to your food i would recommend you proceed with caution because while i dont want to tell you whats going on i get a weird feeling you are missing something here both of your reactions just feel off,MagicCarpet5846
you probably need to just send a message saying its pretty clear you either dont want or arent ready for a relationship with me anymore so i just wanted to make sure were both on the same page this is over and i wish you the best,MagicCarpet5846
yeah personally id make it whenever the lease it up,MagicCarpet5846
oh 100 agree i said elsewhere if them growing apart wasnt enough to ruin the marriage his actions and behavior surely will,MagicCarpet5846
that information isnt included in the post so we cant really tell maybe there is and maybe there isnt perhaps she has other views where she believes tattoos are unclean or against her faith or she just doesnt like the look of them perhaps her ocd would manifest in another way where having a mark on her may trigger her in other ways perhaps shes afraid of needles or has a clotting disorder or a million other things that we cant know but presumably all her loved ones would know im not saying that any of this is the case but im just posing scenarios where it would be legitimate to intervene in someone making a decision fueled by mental illness that wouldnt necessarily be included in a reddit post,MagicCarpet5846
all this to say sometimes if everyone with first hand knowledge of a situation including a medical professional is in agreement theres a chance that they have more informations than we do ill say this if i were going to make a permanent decision i usually wouldnt make and my loved ones knew that and knew i was going through a mental health crisis i would want them to intervene everyone else can feel differently but i would personally rather not make a permanent mistake if someone around me could stop that,MagicCarpet5846
usually 1 of 2 things either the person knows youre not right for them deep down but is also afraid to be alone or hurt you but once forced to be alone actually finds the one and immediately realizes theyve found what was missing all this time prompting them to take the plunge they always dragged their feet on before or sometimes you have to learn the hard way it isnt that the person loved you any less or didnt genuinely want to be with you its just that they really thought they had time they didnt really see what the big deal was and figured you agree that as long as it happens eventually its all good but as soon as theyre reminded that love isnt enough and actually women are willing to leave without that commitment as soon as they find someone they feel that same way about they dont want to lose it again so they act fast,MagicCarpet5846
i dont necessarily disagree but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and ocd and advised her against getting the tattoo because she clearly felt there was ample evidence of it being fueled by the ocd to some extent if it wasnt fueled by ocd it wouldnt make a difference if she got it on her 5th 6th or any other memorable date it would really just matter that shes permanently honouring her mother,MagicCarpet5846
this is a classic case of commenters assuming that the poster has just as much information as they do rather than having way more information including the opinion of a medical professional specifically trained and informed of ops gfs mental health and her current state of mind,MagicCarpet5846
lmao what the fuck youre not immature for just wanting to get married thats absurd,MagicCarpet5846
you know whats even more of a special kind of stupid thinking that your boyfriend who makes the same as you and has more assets than you actually would be with you for your money its pretty obviously a joke and the fact that she cant realize she is the one with less money in the relationship so obviously he isnt with her for money just goes to show that she isnt ready for a serious relationship yet,MagicCarpet5846
well most notably she thinks im with her for her money and then we make the same as one another and i have more assets than she does like fam this is not a woman to start a life with you have kids you need someone stable and trustworthy not a woman looking to bail any time you make a joke a joke that anyone smart enough to be a fucking doctor should realize is a joke you literally have more money than her,MagicCarpet5846
you can emigrate to another country then as it seems yours doesnt really care about peoples actual happiness either that or be unhappy it seems like you get the choice of being unhappy and rich or unhappy and poor,MagicCarpet5846
it doesnt matter i hate people who act like someone needs to justify why they want something shes allowed to just want to be married she doesnt need to explain it no one needs to explain why they want kids or get married or have a monogamous relationship youre allowed to just want that and youre allowed to end an otherwise great relationship with someone who doesnt,MagicCarpet5846
i understand i hope you dont think i was implying you would cheat but understand insecurity is a hell of a thing that being said your weight is definitely not the only thing different about you you said yourself youve made a lot of big changes in the past few years its disingenuous to act like the only change is your weight not only will that many changes come with a natural shift in your personality you also said you two no longer have a big thing in common your love for games and more likely than not if youre gymming that much the way you spend your free time has also changed significantly perhaps you no longer enjoy the same foods or restaurants you once did you would almost need to or else you wouldnt have lost so much weight maybe you like to go hiking whereas before you two would watch a movie instead i get its hard for you to see how much you changed because to you youre still you but as someone who has had their partner undertake huge changes like youre describing i can promise you its way more than just your weight youre practically a new person and that can be scary for him and he also may not feel like you two are on the same page anymore,MagicCarpet5846
like i said in a previous comment just because you think everything is fine and you dont care about how different you two are now doesnt mean he doesnt care and based on everything youre saying its clear he cares,MagicCarpet5846
time to put on your big girl pants and say the scary thing i know you havent given it much thought but after 4 years you need to start im not willing to wait as long as youre saying you want before marriage is even on the table to discuss you need to think long and hard now about if you want to marry me because the option isnt going to be on the table forever and its not even going to be on the table for another year im sorry to put you in a difficult spot but this is a dealbreaker for me if four years isnt enough time for you to be sure then no amount of time will be and im not willing to wait any longer to find that out i love you and i want us to be together but i love me more i know what i want in life and i wont be a girlfriend for a decade its just not something i have any interest in,MagicCarpet5846
the thing is you dont need to know the details of their relationship not everyone wants to be a girlfriend for 67 years its the same thing as one person wanting kids and another not even if the rest of the relationship is everything you ever hoped youd find this is a deal breaker,MagicCarpet5846
and thats before factoring in theres no way to know if he really will ever marry her or is just kicking the can down the road like so many men do and why so many women are not willing to be a girlfriend for 67 years,MagicCarpet5846
yeah i mean i think its easy for us to sit from our chair and tell op to leave but i agree if she wants to feel like she gave him a chance she needs to be brutally honest with him too that timeline doesnt work for me if you dont see yourself getting engaged or married for a few years we need to part ways i want a relationship that is working towards marriage and if after 4 years that isnt a step youre willing to take with me yet im not willing to wait until you are you need to think about if this is really how you feel because if so we need to be having a very different conversation,MagicCarpet5846
i honestly think everyone acting like he took advantage of her is making too big of an assumption more likely than not he got someone who he felt comfortable with and now is afraid that shes gotten hot and successful and will want to upgrade her partner its pretty common from both men and women and isnt as malicious or intentional as people think its just that some people arent able to handle jealousy and insecurity and purposefully choose a partner that doesnt flare that insecurity and arent prepared for such a huge shake up,MagicCarpet5846
that combined with i stayed by my partner when they were fatpoorno bodyetc and then they became hotrichfamous etc and the first thing they did was leave me for someone they met at the gymworkwherever is way more common than people want to admit do i think thats op no not at all but its silly to pretend that exactly what this guy is afraid of isnt something that happens all the time it happens so often that its a running troupe of people in professions like doctors lawyers tech and professional sports,MagicCarpet5846
i think you are being naive yes because the reality is hes making these comments because youve already grown apart for you maybe you dont care but for him it seems he cares he wants a woman who shares the same hobbies with him who is lower maintenance and doesnt care about how she looks or making a ton of money im not saying this to criticize you strong independent women are amazing and we need more of them in this world but not everyone wants a gym rat girl boss tm some people want a cozy gamer and that isnt you anymore and thats okay but its naive to act like if you think its fine so does he and clearly he doesnt think its fine he clearly feels like hes already lost the woman he fell in love with do not change for him please you should always be who you feel most comfortable being but you also may need to come to terms with the fact that youve begun to walk different paths that no longer cross,MagicCarpet5846
maybe dont focus too much on him wanting someone to control because that might not really be true more likely he thought had a sweet chubby introverted gamer girl he wasnt worried about losing and now youre independent making more money than him youve gotten hot and probably have more male attention from dudes who never wouldve looked at you before and lets be real youve become an entirely different person than you were when you met he likely feels like he cant compete with the sort of guys you can get now,MagicCarpet5846
how hes handling it isnt cool and its controlling but its also probably coming from a place of fear and desperationpanic that hes about to lose you the sad thing is if the fact that you two are now completely different people wasnt going to ruin your relationship how hes acting now certainly will its a selffulfilling prophecy but also the reality is you grew up and he didnt and thats okay but you two dont seem to be compatible anymore,MagicCarpet5846
honestly i thought it was him making fun of how everyone in the sub jumps to insane conclusions boy was i wrong,MagicCarpet5846
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman forgive yourself but also recognize you cant keep pretending this marriage is functional it isnt now and it wasnt before end it and set yourself free,MagicCarpet5846
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman,MagicCarpet5846
lmao of course were not 100 accurate but you said it yourself he was jerking you around why do you suddenly think thats going to change,MagicCarpet5846
ive read your other comments youre either looking for a fight because youre upset this dude is ghosting or youre a troll because you havent responded to a single comment genuinely looking for an objective viewpoint youre just trying to argue which just makes me think if youre actually a real person really going through this dude has probably realized 10 year younger tang isnt worth crazy if youre a real person just recognize how batshit you must come off in real life if after 4 comments on the internet pretty much any man on here would be running from you good luck i do hope youre a troll because otherwise youre in for a very sad life if you dont grow up and fast,MagicCarpet5846
yeah you dont respect yourself why wouldnt he beg you to move in you demand nothing of him let him do whatever he wants never ask for more and here you are left alone at home while he goes and hangs out with the family who degrades you that he apparently doesnt even care enough about you to talk about you in front of them and you still want to plan elaborate and thoughtful birthday celebrations and get him a cake it makes total sense why a person like him would drool over finding a woman who cant even demand she be a part of his birthday celebration you think he would actually want a woman who calls him out on his shit of course not,MagicCarpet5846
be honest with yourself how much more do you let him get away with,MagicCarpet5846
elaborate what you mean and what you got mad about,MagicCarpet5846
overall he may not have been ignoring you then but you also probably never said im done either so it may be a bit different this time,MagicCarpet5846
he read it because leaving someone on read sends a pretty clear message of i saw what you said i want you to know that i saw what you said and i want you to know that i am intentionally choosing not to reply to you,MagicCarpet5846
in short he isnt interested why did you get mad at him perhaps you were right and this guy isnt right for you so all in all its probably a win for you both im the future just be a bit more careful when you tell someone youre done if you arent prepared to mean it its probably not a great idea to say it rarely do people play well into that sort of hot and cold,MagicCarpet5846
maybe youve learned some valuable lessons dont start things with roommates and if this is a trend maybe youre moving too fast in your relationships and progressing too intensely with the wrong sort of guy youll heal but itll take time dont worry about breaking down youre human and thats a beautiful thing you arent meant to be a robot,MagicCarpet5846
well just remember there is no waiting it out nothing will ever change until you do if youd realized this 45 years ago you couldve been married and successful by now but dont fret the second best time to make a change is now and thankfully you still have time for that,MagicCarpet5846
stop being complacent in your own life you have a choice here dont forget you do have power in your own life you arent helpless,MagicCarpet5846
but remember that is a choice you are actively making you can just as easily and quickly stop being a doormat as much as you dont want to say anything because youre scared and itll hurt or whatever other bullshit you keep telling yourself if you really asked yourself are you not already alone in your own marriage are you not causing yourself pain every day knowing your wife wants another mans affection wondering ifwhen shell cheat on you too,MagicCarpet5846
people often overlook the chronic pain they invite upon themselves because they think an acute pain will be worse but trust me it isnt id rather have a broken arm that will heal than deal with lupus every day until i die,MagicCarpet5846
good youve spent the past decade gaslighting yourself into ignoring or brushing off hundreds of red flags second guess everything and see your life and your marriage for what it really is not what you want it to be that way you can start to see just how much better you deserve and how much better you can get stop allowing yourself to be the backup,MagicCarpet5846
i mean really the only think you can be sure of is youre being a doormat and of course your wife isnt going to respect you you dont even respect yourself youre worth more than this man you have to know that,MagicCarpet5846
how can you lose something you never actually had,MagicCarpet5846
she never actually picked you she just did enough to fool you into thinking she had i dont even see my actual friends from college as much as you seem to have this guy in your lives thats a bit weird dont you think,MagicCarpet5846
heres to hoping he just doesnt care as much as some do care the vast majority really dont enjoy your newfound freedom,MagicCarpet5846
well because its decently obvious by the lets just figure things out as housemates rather than as a couple that he sees it as a relationshipbreaker because shes basically said as much how else would you take that comment,MagicCarpet5846
that is not what the joke implies not even close,MagicCarpet5846
im going to be honest everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions esh because at the end of the day who youre friends with also reflects on you and its pretty abysmal that even after all this you werent the one to pull the plug here on the friendship she was,MagicCarpet5846
having fun and partying is great and all but its practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in manhattan during a huge holiday if this is commonplace for you or your friends and based on your tone it appears to be you need to really selfreflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old,MagicCarpet5846
no i just dont feel the need to engage with victim blamers,MagicCarpet5846
lmao so if you think the wife is abusive its cool to just blame the victim the father of her abuse got it yeah bye now,MagicCarpet5846
id probably only ever see yelling as appropriate if someone is in actual danger or about to do something really destructive and you need to get their attention now i can also see people yelling at one another if extremely angryfed up about a lot of issues in their relationship that theyre just at the end of their rope for but in that example id probably say that either the person yelling has issues themselves or the person yelling is only doing so because they dont love themselves enough to walk away and instead think yelling will get through to an otherwise toxic partner,MagicCarpet5846
ill go out on a limb and say your partner has anger issues though but regardless of if you or he is the problem and its him it isnt you this isnt a healthy relationship,MagicCarpet5846
fiance thankfully she wont need to worry about a divorce all she needs to do is separate finances and figure things out like housemates instead of a couple which conveniently is exactly what shes doing and im sure we can all guess exactly why,MagicCarpet5846
i think the point is unless you think he should be abusive he ultimately isnt in a position to allow his wife to do anything his wife is going to do what his wife is going to do shes her own person just like op is his own person and he cant force him to return home or forgive his sister see the issue youre acting as though the father can just snap his fingers and force everyone to fall in line to his will but thats not how people work his wife and the other kids are all independent people capable of their own decisions and actions theyll act as they see fit and its up to the people around them to react how they see fit the only very loose way to not allow his wife to treat op that way would be by saying if she keeps it up hes divorcing her,MagicCarpet5846
and now were back to the beginning sentiment its unfair and unrealistic to expect this man to throw away his marriage and his relationship with his two other kids who actually live close to him to support ops beliefs who not only isnt cutting off his father but also lives across the country anyway,MagicCarpet5846
idk if i were you id probably just say i know why you beat up  thank you but please dont do it again i dont want assholes like that to ever take anything else from me again and then just give him a big hug,MagicCarpet5846
hey i agree fully im just saying when it comes to the father i understand why he isnt taking such a hard and fast approach now i think cheaters and wrong and i think the mom isnt handling things well at all but those two things are a bit unrelated,MagicCarpet5846
his mom told him that not his father i agree the mom sucks for how shes acting im just saying it makes sense that the dude isnt going to ruin his marriage and relationship with all his other kids when 1 op isnt cutting him off and 2 op is across the country everyone else is right there real life is more complicated than reddit acts,MagicCarpet5846
you should be able to get someone to do it for 5001k at most,MagicCarpet5846
where do you see the dad putting himself in the middle by doing anything other than existing again this is his daughter its ridiculous to expect him to throw away his marriage and his relationship with all of his other kids because you think that its not completely normal for parents to be way more forgiving than you would be to their own childs mistakes,MagicCarpet5846
i repeat the world is not as black and white as you seem to think it is and we do not have all the information here to know any of the details of why everyone feels how they feel on this matter,MagicCarpet5846
she insinuated she does want kids so not sure why either of those should factor in if she wants kids its better to be with someone with a child than someone with undiagnosed and seemingly severe mental illness,MagicCarpet5846
eh i dont really think its fair to expect people to entirely blow up their marriage and their relationship with the rest of their kids to support the beliefs of someone else yeah i think cheaters suck but thats also his daughter it makes sense that even when your kid messes up you arent going to immediately exile them the world isnt as black and white as reddit acts like it is,MagicCarpet5846
it really isnt ive found partners at many ages you probably just arent looking in an effective place,MagicCarpet5846
instead of relying on apps join classes or workout groups with interests you have so you meet someone naturally,MagicCarpet5846
i mean its not actually that hard youre just being defeatist because it scares you to be alone for a year or so but thats perfectly normal be you 25 35 or 45 it takes time to find a good partner,MagicCarpet5846
honestly the mom of whoever called overstepped id get it if a day had passed but thats really overkill for an adult woman a few hours with no contact,MagicCarpet5846
just be prepared for your dad to turn the invite down hes right youre putting him in a nowin situation and more likely than not hes going to avoid pissing off his wife and kids that live close to him youre far away its way less hassle to turn you down than pick a fight with everyone near by i just want to prepare you for the most likely outcome,MagicCarpet5846
you should probably speak to a lawyer familiar with this you should start by getting a survey of your land so you know exactly what is yours and what isnt get up property line markers it shouldnt cost more than 1k for the surveyor and marking everything out with physical markers youre going to need a lawyer to know how to best indicate anyone past this point is officially trespassing because like everyone said youre taking on a huge liability and also putting yourself in a position where your land could be seized by the local government as youve allowed public access i know youre very pregnant but this needs to take priority because the last thing you want is to be recovering from birth and trying to figure out how to be a mom and then youre getting sued because someone on an atv died hitting a low hanging branch and the parents blame you for not trimming the trees or a million other examples that have actually happened and the property owners were held liable for your husband can hopefully take on some of the burden of sorting this as it will likely be a good amount of logistical sorting but itll be cheaper in the long run especially if this is meant to be your forever home put up signs at the entry points for now take photos and get a lawyer asap,MagicCarpet5846
im just going to pop in here to remind everyone that a person with ppp has an approximately 45 chance of either committing infanticide or suicide yes there is an elevated risk and yes these women absolutely need professional help do not treat women with this condition as ticking time bombs though,MagicCarpet5846
you were in a previously abusive relationship so you think as long as he isnt abusive hes great but thats not true you may need some therapy to reset what you should want in a man because this isnt it,MagicCarpet5846
not abusive isnt even the bare minimum of being a half decent guy and it seems like thats really all you have as your standard right now understandable but love yourself more than that aim higher stop going for dudes with no ambition,MagicCarpet5846
hey women can have big feet too,MagicCarpet5846
because if youre in an accident where enough forcefriction is generated to pull off your shoes its just statistically more likely that that same force was lethal,MagicCarpet5846
if you dont leave just tell him you need to be more careful if this happens again im breaking up with you immediately i do not give a shit if its an accident or not if youre so incapable of controlling your dckk you cant keep it from sodomizing me i have 0 interest continuing our relationship am i crystal clear,MagicCarpet5846
and if it happens again then you leave,MagicCarpet5846
all that matters is it makes you feel good,MagicCarpet5846
i dont think dresses like this look good on anyone personally its too shapeless and is reminiscent of a trash bag to me but fashion should always be more about how you feel than what others think imo,MagicCarpet5846
youre never an ah for fighting for your kids never the sooner you learn that the better a father youll be,MagicCarpet5846
just for some actual facts as worms arent something parents tend to discuss at daycare 2030 of preschoolprimary school aged children will have a threadworm infection so definitely common enough that it isnt a surefire sign of neglect but not so common that the parents shouldnt be taking steps to prevent,MagicCarpet5846
because its not him forbidding her access to basic hygiene its just nature of being a parent to a newborn youd have to make the argument an infant is the abusive one as thats who is technically preventing the sil from showering regularly which is entirely ridiculous as a concept until you actually have a kid you clearly are ignorant to the fact that even two present and active parents will often not have time to shower for 2 days it isnt the husband directly saying i forbid you from showering which yeah is abusive its i have a newborn and my husband isnt being a present dad and i dont want to leave my kid alone or take him in the shower with me theyre fundamentally different im not going to argue with someone who has clearly never had a newborn or had the lowest maintenance newborn ever to know that its just plain normal and expected that when you have a newborn you just plain arent going to shower every day hell i dont have a newborn and im so busy with normal adulting tasks that i have often gone 2 days without a shower no one is abusing me its just ridiculous to conflate i dont have time to do x with someone is forcing me not to do x so yeah even by your definition this is not abuse,MagicCarpet5846
i am not going to argue about this further because its clear you dont understand how common it is to be too busy to shower every day when you have a newborn its not a sign of abuse its just a sign of being a parent,MagicCarpet5846
you probably need to stop considering him your husband he said pretty clearly he no longer views you as a wife youre just the woman who gave birth to his kid you need to understand you have absolutely no leverage here and your husband hasnt divorced you yet simply because it would put his daughter through more trauma than she needs right now but you arent an equal partner youre on probation and if you dont start acting like it dont be surprised if he realizes youre trying to traumatize your daughter more by forcing her to be a puppet than he will traumatize her by putting her through a messy custody battle,MagicCarpet5846
op nicely but understand what your husband is really saying hes saying this if you ever want to see your daughter youre going to do everything exactly on my terms otherwise i will go through a court battle to completely strip you of the right to see your daughter i dont want to but if you force me to i will  know youre place and right now your place is egg donor not mother you need to earn the right to call yourself her mom,MagicCarpet5846
sure but none of that is abuse thats just not meeting your needs as a partner that isnt abuse again thats being a bad partner the two are very different and a lot of people conflate the two bad partner yes bad dad probably abusive nothing here indicates that,MagicCarpet5846
he was working regardless of the rest it isnt abusive to tell your partner to take a screaming infant and guest out of the room youre working in look i agree hes a crappy fatherpartner but the bottom line is nothing here is actually abuse its just being a shitty partner,MagicCarpet5846
he isnt keeping her unwashed or sleep deprived being a new borderline single mom is whats keeping her unwashed and sleep deprived and for those who dont understand how parenthood works even two fully attentive parents will likely end up unwashed and sleep deprived in the first year of parenthood its just what happens its not abuse its not neglect its what you sign up for when you have a kid yeah shes doing more than she should but thats different from abuse,MagicCarpet5846
neglecting the child yes neglecting the needs of your partner especially while youre working like the guy was in this story no youre just a poor partner at worst believe it or not shes a fully grown adult and capable of taking care of herself and isnt fully reliant on a man like an infant may be for care abuse is definitely the wrong word here with the information presented please stop pushing for such a strong word to be watered down that only hurts actual abuse victims in the long run again not all bad partners are abusive partners hes a bad partner no info indicating hes an abusive one,MagicCarpet5846
did i miss anything actually funny happening looks like he just walked by them carefully,MagicCarpet5846
shes 23 shes dating a 37 year old how reliable do you really think either of them are going to be at caring for 2 young kids shes going to be stuck in the hotel room earning her free vacation there isnt much other reason 37 year olds date 23 year olds and they certainly dont do it because said 23 year old is practically a mom whatever the fuck that means,MagicCarpet5846
no it isnt weird at all have you ever had a newborn sometimes youre so desperate for adult interaction youll hold up the mailman thats not a sign of abuse thats a sign of parenthood especially parenthood with a rather absent partner,MagicCarpet5846
at the end of the day that was his decision not to actually pursue any means of getting the money back if heyour step sis were unwilling to even try to get the money back from the actual person who stole it theyve pretty much lost the right to even ask anyone else to provide it,MagicCarpet5846
i think jumping to clearly an abuser because hes a bad partner is a stretch hes a bad partner and bad father for sure but this is another example of bad person  abusive person,MagicCarpet5846
hey also depends on the kind of partner youre trying to attract too,MagicCarpet5846
hopefully this has revealed to you a truth about your husband youll stop ignoring as based on your previous comments this behaviorside of him is nothing new what example are you setting for your son by tolerating this behavior,MagicCarpet5846
you probably need to think about the grander scheme of your marriage when you find a place to stay because this doesnt sound like a good place for you at all,MagicCarpet5846
understood is in quotes so op clearly doesnt actually feel like he understands you can say you understand and still not actually take the action required to back that up the likely fact is in order to change the agreement his dad may need to go to court and his mom may not let him go so easily if his dad isnt willing to deal with thatsimply isnt willing to be ops full time guardian understanding or not op is 14 years old and really doesnt have much of a choice on where he lives,MagicCarpet5846
which sucks but hes 14 he cant just move out,MagicCarpet5846
is that actually an option though ops father called him selfish so perhaps he wont let him move in full time not only that it may require a custody battle for that to actually happen if the mom wanted to put up a fight about it,MagicCarpet5846
if you do consider her a friend id send in a text message so you have this in writing if she goes off the deep end something you the effect of hey name im sorry i made you feel worse in an already tough time for you im happy to help you out but i need to be clear about a few things i have no interest in you romantically or sexually i consider you a friend and nothing more i want to be really clear that you dont have to worry about my having any ulterior motives because that simply isnt how i see you and im not comfortable with you implying otherwise while youre living at my place that being said while im happy to give you a place to crash while you get back on your feet i am also not comfortable fully supporting you youll need to take care of food and anything else you need on your own if you havent been paid in 5 weeks thats illegal and you need to talk your boss or file a complaint but im sure im not the only person in your support network so if you need to youll need to lean on more than just me ive been busy lately so im going to continue taking advantage of part of my compensation at work since the food is better than anything i can cook but youre more than welcome to stock the fridge with whatever you want and i wont take any of it if you feel uncomfortable staying with me for whatever reason please dont feel obligated and be upset if you want to stay with someone else but if you do plan to stay moving forward we need to be clear on boundaries i dont want any implications im trying to get with you and you need to start providing the basics for yourself im only here to give you a place to stay nothing more,MagicCarpet5846
fam stop resenting him and start resenting yourself because youre the problem here you ten respecting yourself at all this man has no loyalty to you stop spending time on someone who has told you he isnt loyal,MagicCarpet5846
im pretty sure he meant you dont get paid every day not that you dont get paid when the company tells you,MagicCarpet5846
hey ultimately that might be what ends up happening but i think people sometimes underestimate how difficult it is to connect with that one person who fits all the criteria especially as a 32 year old new father if he doesnt even have time to hang out with existing friends alone its pretty unlikely he will have time to find and vet random people who are okay with hanging out with a baby especially because unfortunately there is a higher chance of someone any gender biting at the gambit to hang out with a man with an infant potentially being not suitable to have around said infant,MagicCarpet5846
we like to say that you should wait around and not take shit and only surround yourselves with the people who are perfectly suited for you but if thats your attitude you also need to be prepared to simply end up alone which when youre a new dad newly in your 30s which is definitely a shock for plenty of people myself included it sucked no longer being in your 20s and old and lost touch with a lot of old friends being alone can be really isolating and isnt actually as healthy advice as you think,MagicCarpet5846
tldr yes the advice of find friends who are okay with being a dad is great but it fails to consider just how hard that process often is when youre a brand new dad,MagicCarpet5846
i am assuming 500 is a lot less than a hotel wouldve cost for the time you stayed,MagicCarpet5846
in light of that id probably say something to the effect of the full day sounds awesome i am really sorry but right now i only have enough room in our savings for the half day thats my fault for not specifying im hoping we get a second income source within the next few months or else were really going to need to figure out some different moves and if youre willing to wait for our thanks until we have a steady income id be happy to set up the full day but otherwise if you do want the full day and are willing to pay the difference i can send over a gift card for the amount and let you decide if you would like to upgrade just let me know im really thankful you let us stay with you and want to make sure you know how grateful i am,MagicCarpet5846
a completely normal and healthy one lmao believe it or not its an extremely unhealthy mentality to have that close family should leave each other high and dry for what amounts to no really good reason reddit is actually pretty toxic in the other direction with family owes you nothing and expect to do everything 100 on your own or else youre a toxic failure we have family for a reason and quite frankly its an extremely eurocentric view that many cultures would have a serious issue with family helps family family shows up for family and honestly outside of redditextenuating circumstances if your family cant rely on you to follow through that says more about you than your family,MagicCarpet5846
again if this were an issue shouldve been raised when he was asked to be the best man the brother is going to be close enough where if anything happens hell just be able to leave its a local wedding he leaves them alone for work he can leave them alone to be the best man he agreed to,MagicCarpet5846
yeah you generally speaking do get to expect your brother who agreed to be your best man at your child free wedding follows through he absolutely can decide not to but the brother is the asshole not op its fine to not expect family to bend over backwards and set themselves on fire to keep you warm but reddit has gone way too far in the opposite direction family does owe family some grace especially if no abuse or other factors are at play these are normal siblings the brother would 10000 be an asshole for dropping out because he cant be away from his wife and kid for half a day especially when he agreed knowing it was a child free wedding and likely knowing the intimate details of why its childfree,MagicCarpet5846
most og influencers actually worked as well you can be serious about something and still understand you also cant leech off other people i mean hell johnny depp only became an actor because he wanted to finance his music career,MagicCarpet5846
hes ops best man presumably he was aware of the no child wedding for a long time he would absolutely be an ah to back out of a commitment made understanding the rules of the commitment just because hes being held to those rules not only would he be an ah to op hes also be being an ah to his kid as our society is by and large moving away from tolerating overgrown toddlers and mommas boys,MagicCarpet5846
correct but as i said look at things from kates perspective how would she know that jamie wanted op there so he could propose she couldnt all she saw was jamie begging for op to attend his birthday party and with all the other info she had thats definitely going to breed insecurity in most people jealousy is a human emotion and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it i see why she felt the way she did,MagicCarpet5846
i mean not really look at literally every female celebrity ever they were hot before and theyre hot now honestly id argue most looked better without the surgery its definitely not accurate to say hotter more likely its just different its all about self perception sometimes,MagicCarpet5846
and yeah but also if she looked how she did but was a horrid person she wouldnt be with him either so it isnt just looks attraction is important but its not everything im sure she knows that its different if she thought thats the only reason her husband is with her of course,MagicCarpet5846
before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole she said shes struggled with this even as a teen meaning the surgery isnt what made her the hot one she always was she just had surgery to make herself feel better about how she looked but clearly shes always been beautiful to everyone around her even without the surgery and that friends is body dysmorphia in a nutshell,MagicCarpet5846
it probably doesnt help that jamie and op do have so much more than just him finding her attractive theyre really good friends to the point where he was begging op to rearrange her schedule to be at the party im not saying hes in love with her at all but from the perspective of kate i understand where the insecurities lie you cant just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more they have an emotional bond as well now i know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them but putting yourself in kates shoes it can be hard to say that confidently i feel for op though it sucks to lose friends for something you cant control,MagicCarpet5846
fair enough you date enough people unfortunately youll encounter plenty of toxic ones definitely do not make this right though she either needs to come to her senses which i suspect she will at some point especially if you dont chase after her or she wont in which case you can decide if thats really the sort of trait you want in a partner good luck you did nothing wrong though btw never lend money you arent willing to lose,MagicCarpet5846
nah 24 is definitely an age where its fair to expect a person be mature and responsibly by shes been out of college for 23 years at this point she isnt a freshman in college thats definitely not normal behavior even for a 24 year old,MagicCarpet5846
that isnt really true plenty of people are willing to bail their partners out now are they obligated to no but dont imply that asking your partner for any financial help automatically is unhealthy,MagicCarpet5846
yeah and a reminder of your friends should understand if you cant contribute 1k dinners youre an awesome person and a true friend will be happy to have your company and whatever it is you can contribute thats in your budget i had a lot of friends way wealthier than me at that age there was never an expectation i had to keep up,MagicCarpet5846
well dresses makeup the bachelorette party spa day theres lots of things you could contribute that would be around that much,MagicCarpet5846
tbf if you have a pattern of ending up with immature women its possible that regardless of the age youre being attracted by traits that go hand in hand with this sort of immaturity,MagicCarpet5846
i am pretty sure a lot of 24 year olds are significantly more mature than this especially ones who have educationsjobs and friends are getting married,MagicCarpet5846
why would he offer to pay for a night out he wasnt even at i get we freak at age gaps but 24 and 32 are both adults that are at approximately the same life stage this isnt about age as much about 1 dont lend money youre not willing to lose and 2 always check your bank account,MagicCarpet5846
so i want to address both sides of this the first is your friend lied to you and thats definitely problematic i dont really think testing people is ever a great tactic that said hes a friend not a lover and you dont necessarily need to be able to have the same level of trust in a friend as you would your wife so if you decide to keep being friends with him after this simply make sure you do so with caution and a modicum of distance put between you two on anything of importance i understand that may be controversial but 1 its difficult to make friends once youre older and have a family and 2 if all of us are honest we have or at least have had plenty of friends that were good to go to lunch or a concert with but you would never call if you needed a place to stay or something huge,MagicCarpet5846
now onto his side of things hes a 29 year old male yes there are some dudes who will be fine going on a stroller walk but the reality is most guys arent hell id probably guess most dudes with kids wouldnt even want to do that as a hang out theyre going to want to have fun go to a bar watch a game play pool or whatever that activity is im not saying its going to involve drugs or blacking out but you probably also need to understand that in order to maintain friendships you need to retain your identity as okstill179 first and loving father second a lot of women also struggle with this balance so dont be alarmed or feel weird about it make sure youre taking time to go and just be you with your friends and make sure youre not making you and your infant a package deal most single 20s guys just arent going to want a kid involved and i definitely empathize it may mean its a few months till you and your wife find that balance so just ask for some patience but remember that the balance is important to find especially if realistically you want to be able to maintain friendships,MagicCarpet5846
she said she sold it at a profit but so its an investment are you telling me you should sell your stocks at what you paid for it even if theyre worth double thats just stupid,MagicCarpet5846
that is what happens when youre the waitress at a table you come back multiple times,MagicCarpet5846
ok if thats what you mean then i understand that thats fair to expect once ownership has changed hands,MagicCarpet5846
youre aware that you only deem op an ah because you want the brother to be able to continue to take advantage right because an eviction wouldve been inevitable unless you think he shouldve been allowed to take advantage as nauseam and at that point the difference between op serving him with an eviction and the new owner is its way harder to pressure a stranger than family so why do you really think the eviction is an ah move,MagicCarpet5846
genuinely asking btw because i get what people are saying but i dont think they realize what that really would mean,MagicCarpet5846
fair enough but no and i think a lot of people are really not understanding its extremely common that rented apartments dont have top of the line run your shower max temp for hours at a time water heaters that would be required for 56 people to get hot showers i mean hell my old apartment i alone couldnt take a shower longer than 15 minutes without getting cold water thats just usually how it is when you rent you dont get unlimited hot water you have to plan your showers you deal with it,MagicCarpet5846
a quick common sense search also tells you 3 is a lot less than 612,MagicCarpet5846
its very obvious you think renting a home is the same as owning and it simply is not when you finally do own a home maybe youll understand until then dont comment on what you clearly dont understand,MagicCarpet5846
thats simply not true if that were actually true developers builders property managers etc would never go bankrupt but they 100 do that would mean these people never get sued never had to evict anyone never have any damages ot gone a month without rent theres absolutely a risk just because someone is typically smart enough not to overextend themselves to the point where they cant float the additional costs does not mean there is no risk it just shows your ignorance on the costs involved in running a business and owning a home to think there isnt if there was no risk everyone would be a landlord but they arent why because theres risk,MagicCarpet5846
nta,Mentalcomposer
haha your brother and his wife  arent very self aware are they,Mentalcomposer
i hope you let him know all the years he and his wife tormented you about your weight is the absolute reason you can be rude to her,Mentalcomposer
good for you,Mentalcomposer
to all saying e s h,Mentalcomposer
she was a teenager being made fun of by grown adults that in itself warrants her clapping back,Mentalcomposer
gross,Mentalcomposer
does she know this,Mentalcomposer
time for an honest convo about where you two are,Mentalcomposer
she may think you are going to be a cute little family and youre over here thinking youll take care of the baby because youre going to do that right  but this is not going to turn into a living together and being a couple,Mentalcomposer
its not unheard of that a hookup gets pregnant and you both comparent but not have a relationship,Mentalcomposer
id have to ask him about it,Mentalcomposer
if he was that drunk its possible he doesnt even remember it and continues  to hang out with these people who are clearly not his friends,Mentalcomposer
youve known him for 4 years does he look 20 or 16  do you recognize his clothes as what he wears now or in the past look for little clues as to a timeline,Mentalcomposer
or he knows it happened and it was a one off that his friends were just screwing with him because he got so drunk way way too far but idk these ppl,Mentalcomposer
either way it warrants a conversation,Mentalcomposer
he may be embarrassed but if he cant discuss it with you after 4 years together i wont say its a problem per say but you two should be able to talk about pretty much most things by now,Mentalcomposer
right now im kinda obsessed with married at first sight,Mentalcomposer
its a train wreck but i cant help myself,Mentalcomposer
does it not seem odd to anyone that,Mentalcomposer
you live outside of the country your godfather gets diagnosed decides to rewrite his will and,Mentalcomposer
the only person gf told he gave you your inheritance already was your brother,Mentalcomposer
the one who got everything,Mentalcomposer
im calling shenanigans on your brother hes gross taking advantage of a sick old man,Mentalcomposer
youre broken up  stop obsessing over did she or didnt she cheat,Mentalcomposer
what diff would it make to know at this point anyway,Mentalcomposer
will you be more angry and what purpose will that serve,Mentalcomposer
being angry at your ex will do nothing for you except hinder your moving forward,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be an angry ex to any other girls you might meet cause thats a sure fire way to stay single nobody wants a bf who is stuck in the past,Mentalcomposer
block her and her friend move on,Mentalcomposer
but theyre not that young if he gave them cars and expensive trips,Mentalcomposer
and they all still have their college fund they lose nothing while hes still alive,Mentalcomposer
he didnt say how many nieces and nephews he has but his wealth seems to be enough that even if they dont get the whole thing they will all still be getting a nice chunk of change  its his million dollar insurance investments and his home and a summer home,Mentalcomposer
its sad really that these young adults are so selfish to think he shouldnt leave his daughter the bulk of his estate,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if anyone from his family has ever expressed any happiness that this man is becoming a father they all know how they felt when they had their kids,Mentalcomposer
this is your first relationship and it has moved way way way too fast,Mentalcomposer
the find my iphone thing would have been an instant break up,Mentalcomposer
if you break up her mental state is not your concern what did she do before you were around,Mentalcomposer
anyway what you need is some time to yourself,Mentalcomposer
stop picking her up every single day,Mentalcomposer
go back to your 3 dates a week,Mentalcomposer
you will have time for yourselves and will also have things to talk about when you get together,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should join a club or activity so you meet some people you need other things in your life besides her,Mentalcomposer
and tell her that you will not  note will not  entertain her ridiculous amount of texts throughout the day she can either stop sending them or be prepared for them to be ignored,Mentalcomposer
you are an adult you have a job you cant be watching tik toks all damn day,Mentalcomposer
you have to make your boundaries very clear to her or she will run over every one of them,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a talk with his mother is she as worried about him as you or is she ok with what hes doing if she is worried then you two need to decide what to do next,Mentalcomposer
if he has a therapist maybe it would be worthwhile to make sure they know what hes been saying,Mentalcomposer
maybe he needs in house mental health care,Mentalcomposer
im sorry youre going thru this its painful when your kids are struggling,Mentalcomposer
you are the teacher all teachers should aspire to be,Mentalcomposer
good job school dad,Mentalcomposer
if he had a draw id just throw them in but it feels odd to just throw them  on a shelf all willy nilly idk,Mentalcomposer
now i feel like a weirdo,Mentalcomposer
im a woman and i do like your gf and it goes in a draw,Mentalcomposer
but i do the laundry and i fold my husbands underwear boxer briefs are bigger than my bikinis and have more structure to them,Mentalcomposer
his dresser is a tall one so he has shelves on the top where his underwear and socks go on the top shelf behind doors and deep drawers on the bottom,Mentalcomposer
so he stacks his undies so in  order to stack they need to be folded,Mentalcomposer
makes perfect sense to me,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
the idea that shes more worried about talking to him is a problem,Mentalcomposer
she might find that after spending however long24 hrs with hubby she might actually enjoy alone time,Mentalcomposer
and she gets to hang with her gfs for her bday and talk about the wedding and honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
i realize tho that some people feel a certain way about their bday maybe shes one of them,Mentalcomposer
me ill celebrate whenever just wish me hb  on the day and were good i dont even want a gift just take me to dinner,Mentalcomposer
i tripped coming down stairs and broke my tibia,Mentalcomposer
i sprain my ankles pretty easily so i,Mentalcomposer
thought it was just that,Mentalcomposer
hobbled on it the rest of the evening and until midday the next day,Mentalcomposer
i was on vacation at the time,Mentalcomposer
had a cast up to my knee and was told no weight on it at all,Mentalcomposer
got home a week later went to ortho and the break was stable so i got a walking boot and had to go for physical therapy,Mentalcomposer
its been a little more than 4 months and the swelling is gone but i still feel little twinges in the ankle or leg at times,Mentalcomposer
age doesnt really have anything to do with it,Mentalcomposer
i started with just store bought readers probably around 40,Mentalcomposer
when they stopped working i needed rx glasses but at that time my doc did say that i probably would need distance glasses as i got  not so young he never said the word old,Mentalcomposer
now i wear progressive lenses all the time cause i cant see near or far,Mentalcomposer
ill admit i still hate wearing glasses i never feel like they look good on my face ive also never wore sunglasses for the same reason,Mentalcomposer
i asked about contacts but that was a no go too,Mentalcomposer
its been a month if she cant compromise so you both can schedule your daily call earlier at this point she never will,Mentalcomposer
schedule a 15 min call at 8 pm then she can both go do whatever and you can go to sleep when you need to,Mentalcomposer
also texting is ok too you dont have to have marathon calls every night,Mentalcomposer
of course they did,Mentalcomposer
have to keep it till the 11th our so both sides can tout their compromises and their thats what we were proposing all alongs,Mentalcomposer
this whole routine is getting old,Mentalcomposer
i think it doesnt matter that its  a you feel as opposed to her feeling that way,Mentalcomposer
shes not going to admit shes just with you for the lifestyle you can afford her so it doesnt  even make sense to ask add in that its difficult to talk to her about money why is that,Mentalcomposer
you think this relationship isnt an equal financial partnership in addition to not feeling this is a romantic pairing anymore,Mentalcomposer
shes a gf not a wife there is no reason you have to stay with her if you want to move and go back to school she supported her d before you came along and she can go back to doing just that,Mentalcomposer
youre going to work part time to basically help support her and her d why would you do that youll be gone 5 out of 7 days of the week,Mentalcomposer
its time you decide what you want not what you think is the right thing to do as far as gf is concerned,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i dont think theres anything wrong with that,Mentalcomposer
we do it frequently in my family and we all live about an hour away,Mentalcomposer
we just had a childs bday the day before mothers day and we all gave the moms their gifts then,Mentalcomposer
no sense driving on sat seeing everyone and then driving again on sunday,Mentalcomposer
just give your dad a heads up that since youre making the drive for the graduation its silly to do it again just a week later he shouldnt have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
hes afraid youll expose him as the abuser he is to the gf,Mentalcomposer
i might accidentally on purpose run into gf at daycare one day if at least ask the daycare people about her does she seem like shes nice enough to your d,Mentalcomposer
doesnt the daycare realize that all of a sudden someone new is picking up d and using her dads pin to do it,Mentalcomposer
you would think they would want to know who she is give her her own pin and have a contact number,Mentalcomposer
stop trying to find your one and only that will lead you to settling just so you have someone which is why you maybe stayed in an emotionally challenging relationship for so long,Mentalcomposer
take this little break to analyze what it is you want in a partner and what you are not willing to put up with,Mentalcomposer
this is especially important for people who had less than easy relationships you dont want to get back in the same routine just because its what you know  does that make sense wasnt sure how to put it,Mentalcomposer
when you feel you are at your strongest then you can put yourself out there and start dating again,Mentalcomposer
and maybe you can be the one to go after the person you want to be with iow ask out the guy you want to get to know instead of waiting for him to do the asking how many guys do we not date because they didnt ask,Mentalcomposer
itll happen maybe when you least expect it,Mentalcomposer
but is he in therapy,Mentalcomposer
its great that your bro adopted an older kid but he had to know this child would come with some issues  its been years what are they doing to help him,Mentalcomposer
then thats what you should do,Mentalcomposer
move out to the country,Mentalcomposer
you two are never going to agree on lifestyle and be assured where you live will dictate your lifestyle,Mentalcomposer
youll stay in london and be unhappy and years from now youll realize you should have left years ago,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
as long as when applying for this job your wife knew there would be travel,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine you went thru the application interview process and accepted this job without talking to your wife about it,Mentalcomposer
but also its only 4 days with one almost 4 yo why cant she handle that,Mentalcomposer
i would tell her that instead of making excuses as to why she thinks hes still open to the idea she needs to just ask him,Mentalcomposer
its a simple do you want kids  that is either a yes or a no question not a discussion,Mentalcomposer
although we all know he doesnt she needs to hear it point blank,Mentalcomposer
why in the world would you volunteer that info,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason for her to ask specifics of your where and what you did with a past gf and its kind of gross that you even told her,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should think about having some respect for the woman you date and not go blabbing a gentleman never tells,Mentalcomposer
reditt has a mix of everything,Mentalcomposer
i like seeing how diff generations deal with issues,Mentalcomposer
theres funny sad stupid weird crazy posts its amazing to see glimpses into how people live,Mentalcomposer
and sometimes i feel i can give sound advice you know from being soooo old,Mentalcomposer
buy bitcoin,Mentalcomposer
this was said in the very beginning by my 20 something son,Mentalcomposer
but at the time i knew nothing except i thought bc was being used for things on the dark web,Mentalcomposer
and since i dont even know how to get on the dark web thought there was no reason to buy,Mentalcomposer
yeah missed out on that big time,Mentalcomposer
now i listen when he suggests something especially when i dont know anything about it dont always do it but i listen,Mentalcomposer
does your state have aca insurance,Mentalcomposer
id look into that first the subsidies really can make it affordable,Mentalcomposer
but id start with just a regular doctor visit  it may be something simple as an infection try to find a clinic in your area,Mentalcomposer
so hes okay with you feeding him but has a problem when you offer to feed his gf who just happens to be in the house its not like you only cook when shes there,Mentalcomposer
why is he afraid youre gonna steal her with food is he afraid shes only hanging out with him because you feed her,Mentalcomposer
ask roomie what the problem is and then stop doing what he doesnt like,Mentalcomposer
if that means not feeding her then stop feeding him too,Mentalcomposer
you sound like a great roomie you mow and offered to wash their cars,Mentalcomposer
who does that youre like southern hospitality on steroids,Mentalcomposer
so i saw that there are 175 or so winners of this award,Mentalcomposer
surely they all cant make an acceptance speech,Mentalcomposer
so my q is is tw slated to say something,Mentalcomposer
and if she is supposed to talk why her shes hardly the most esteemed of the list of winners,Mentalcomposer
i can understand others going to meet and make connections but no one wants to meet or connect with her shes hardly the it person at this point,Mentalcomposer
on the other hand might be nice if she went and was shunned but wed never know that anyway,Mentalcomposer
dont feel bad i think the same thing,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how did a bunch of 14 yos get to a cabin 2 hours away,Mentalcomposer
someone had to drive them,Mentalcomposer
and who leaves a bunch of 14 yos on their own,Mentalcomposer
the girl whose cabin it is had to have known there were no beds in the cabin,Mentalcomposer
everything about this was a mess from the get go,Mentalcomposer
you did nothing wrong you had company who were taking up sleeping space in your home,Mentalcomposer
and if you had a bunch of young girls sleep in the house with you and your friends i guarantee someone would have had a problem with that too and that optic is worse,Mentalcomposer
what kind of work do you do,Mentalcomposer
if it is mentally taxing that could be why youre exhausted dont discount the amount of energy you expend by literally thinking and problem solving,Mentalcomposer
if thats not it then you have the classic  a body at rest tends to stay at rest get up and walk around every hour or so,Mentalcomposer
you also work 6 days a week,Mentalcomposer
and dont go home and just sit  do something anything even for 15 min at first  walk around the block do 10 push ups,Mentalcomposer
i have been down the alf and nh  road with my sister the diff is she is disabled and had zero assets,Mentalcomposer
can you clarify something please,Mentalcomposer
assisted living costs 6500 month,Mentalcomposer
but you said your dad has an income of 6800mo does this money include his 401,Mentalcomposer
he has enough income to pay for this,Mentalcomposer
why do you think he cant afford this,Mentalcomposer
he of course is not ever going to be able to give your brother any money ever ever ever again,Mentalcomposer
hell have 300 extra every month you can bring him what he needs from this money deodorant clothes etc,Mentalcomposer
when his money runs out he can apply for medicare and i know they cover nursing home not sure about alf  i think only if disabled but even then we had to private pay for 2 yrs before my sister qualified,Mentalcomposer
your dad may well be ready for a nh by the time hes 86,Mentalcomposer
i think this will work,Mentalcomposer
if he can pay cash for 6 or more years he can transfer the house now then it wont be in the look back period make double sure what the look back period is  i think it may be longer but im going with this time since it seems to be the consensus in the comments,Mentalcomposer
also when you move him in go see the social services office they should have one,Mentalcomposer
explain to them that your dad is private pay his house is not needing to be sold in order to pay his bill and no one from the facility should be talking to his dad about it at all,Mentalcomposer
have them put it in his admission record watch them do it explain that linda is pushing this and its not going to happen,Mentalcomposer
you might want to get a poa for your dad that way he cant be held if he signs anything,Mentalcomposer
i love a sweeter breading on pork it just seems to go together,Mentalcomposer
i havent done frosted flakes just because i dont normally buy that cereal,Mentalcomposer
try adding some crushed almonds to it too,Mentalcomposer
nta because ops fianc bro to the sil was in agreement with how everything was planned did his sister go complain to him i wonder,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt really matter that sil blocked this couple,Mentalcomposer
in a couple of months they wont ever be seeing each other because this couple is banned from bringing their baby to any family functions anyway,Mentalcomposer
lets see how long that lasts no one can tell me that grandma isnt going to want to see that baby at christmas,Mentalcomposer
and op if your in laws want to do separate holidays so sil doesnt have to see your baby id advise against it we are either a family or we are not,Mentalcomposer
at this point send 1 group message to anyone who has your number then block all of them you dont need this crap from anyone,Mentalcomposer
id mention the fact that none of them contacted you when your bf of 4 yrs disappeared when you were pregnant and both him and his mother ignored repeated attempts at contact after that,Mentalcomposer
then mention the repeated attempts after the baby was born and passed,Mentalcomposer
then nicely mention they can all go to hell,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how old is this guy,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt let him in either even if i heard him this is lower than even basic adulting,Mentalcomposer
he remembers to lock the door and that doesnt instantly make him realize he needs a key,Mentalcomposer
you can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did,Mentalcomposer
not going to be popular but oh well,Mentalcomposer
honestly i think your wife is just done with parenting altogether its easy to just say go out and play,Mentalcomposer
you  bathed them took to urgent care went to pharmacy made breakfast and she hadnt even gotten out of bed yet then you still had to go fill the prescription,Mentalcomposer
and then she gives you attitude and decides she isnt talking to you,Mentalcomposer
im all for giving the sahp a day to sleep in and taking over the kids but when my spouse tells me its urgent care time you bet im up and seeing whats going on has she always been so irresponsible,Mentalcomposer
this relationship has run its course,Mentalcomposer
its extremely common when ppl start dating as teens,Mentalcomposer
but you are an adult and you have to know that cheating is not the way to get out of a relationship thats a cop out,Mentalcomposer
you knew on some level exactly what you were doing and you thought this would be a sure fire way for your gf to break up with you im shocked you were the one who had to tell her,Mentalcomposer
you havent said much about your gf reaction is she not upset how could she even want to still live with you,Mentalcomposer
are you planning on living together until sept  thats a mistake,Mentalcomposer
doesnt your school break for summer go back home or find someone who has a graduating roommate and move in there,Mentalcomposer
me too,Mentalcomposer
just never liked her,Mentalcomposer
maybe its time to lay out everything sis has said and done to you to the kids if they dont know,Mentalcomposer
that way they will know to stay away from sis and not believe anything she says,Mentalcomposer
they are old enough to make a decision not to be around their aunt and id expect them to decline any invites where she will be,Mentalcomposer
your h can go alone he is the one who didnt put a stop to this nonsense from the very beginning,Mentalcomposer
i can understand partner worries about transitioning in that climate but what op is asking about has less to do with that,Mentalcomposer
the way i read it is that each one of them is asking for reassurance about the other still wanting to be a couple its their personal relationship they are worried about,Mentalcomposer
and in that case the transitioning one is not really reassuring op  why shouldnt both of them be each others support ops life is drastically changing also she is going from having a male partner to having a female partner its a lot to handle and their concerns shouldnt be discounted just because shes not the one going thru the physical transition they need to know that during and after transition their partner is planning to still be there,Mentalcomposer
op you need to explain to your partner what youre feeling and thinking your partner should be doing everything in their power to reassure you when your insecurities creep in,Mentalcomposer
i dont think id want anyone in my home without me being there even if you know half this couple,Mentalcomposer
isnt it kind of understood that youd all be going back to your home together at the end of the night thats what i would expect if i was the friend,Mentalcomposer
maybe call your friend and ask her to thank her bf for the trinkets you should def acknowledge it,Mentalcomposer
i always wonder tho you spent a few hours with this new person did any of you actually try to talk to him get to know him,Mentalcomposer
its hard being the new one its natural to be the more quiet one in this setting,Mentalcomposer
if you did and he didnt really reciprocate or try to keep the convo going then great but usually its the group just doing their thing and expecting the newbie to just join right on in which if youre not an outgoing personality is hard to do,Mentalcomposer
if one wants kids then its not going to work ever,Mentalcomposer
if its a matter of spouse just wanting to sponge off the other then you have to decide if thats a dynamic you would be happy with,Mentalcomposer
if you can afford to live on one income and the stay home person is willing to look at doing all the domestic upkeep as their job and the other will be ok with that then maybe try it out,Mentalcomposer
but if one feels that no one should be a stay home person then again its not going to work someone will always be resentful,Mentalcomposer
ooh how good would it be if no photogs even bothered to take her pic,Mentalcomposer
she gets out of the car no flashes,Mentalcomposer
she walks to the door no flashes,Mentalcomposer
she walks out at the end no flashes,Mentalcomposer
that would be awesome,Mentalcomposer
conventional wisdom says dont quit until you have another job lined up,Mentalcomposer
so thats what you should be doing use your unhappiness about your job and homelife to give you that push to find another job,Mentalcomposer
id you quit with nothing lined up you will be home all day in a place that makes you miserable,Mentalcomposer
you have an education so you should be able to find something else,Mentalcomposer
and dont just take anything find something you think wont make you miserable but also that will allow you to move out even with a roommate or,Mentalcomposer
two,Mentalcomposer
dont just go thru life start taking a pro active stance with your life its the only one you got,Mentalcomposer
thats all well and good if you want to believe that but the second i walked in and saw everyone else i would have had some questions of my sister,Mentalcomposer
and i wouldnt have stayed after such a blatant disrespect of my relationship,Mentalcomposer
i believe your hopefully ex gf never mind fianc knew all along theres no way she hasnt been around or talked to anyone in the family or friends in the lead up to this marriage for it to not come out,Mentalcomposer
why you are still with this person is beyond me you obviously arent her number one and if im marrying someone thats the spot they should be in,Mentalcomposer
well id like to think a 4 year old knows the word beautiful,Mentalcomposer
one of mine was reading by then who do i call to get an article about them,Mentalcomposer
it still just blows my mind that any and i mean any publication would print obvious puff pieces that have anything to do with these two,Mentalcomposer
i cant be bothered to check cause i really dont care but did either of these two publications cover the chase non chase or do they just exist to go give platitudes,Mentalcomposer
oh did you think she was actually going to do something,Mentalcomposer
ive figured her out,Mentalcomposer
since shes a woman and self proclaimed activist she thinks that is enough to get otherpeople to do something,Mentalcomposer
she just collects awards while others do the work,Mentalcomposer
i can understand her wanting stability you have a child together and she wants to be married for all the protections that come with that for her and your child,Mentalcomposer
so give her a wedding maybe not the one she wants but one you can afford,Mentalcomposer
stability in a relationship is more about the innate knowledge that youre in a partnership that person is there for the long haul through it all its less about the stuff you have,Mentalcomposer
but stability also comes in another form and keeping even one of the properties will give you instant financial stability in the future if the need arises for an immediate need for a large amount of cash,Mentalcomposer
a luxury apt is nice if its well within your income level to purchase and upkeep it which it isnt because you have to sell off both your safety nets to afford it,Mentalcomposer
not to mention one is your childhood home,Mentalcomposer
or would stability come from owning an apt that is easily affordable and you can then save more for experiences you both may want in the future travel or hobbies or extra activities for your child or if you have another or two or more children kids are expensive,Mentalcomposer
im one who has always believed to live below your means without denying myself certain things that i want and save as much money as possible investments and building wealth will always trump biggerbetter or more expensive every time for me,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its absolutely astonishing to me that your gf wants to sell property as part of financing a wedding  and not just 1 property but both of them how big of a wedding does she want and how expensive of an apt,Mentalcomposer
i could maybe understand maybe selling the apt if its not a place you or her do not want to live maybe you cant live in the country while working in the city or for whatever reason but  in that case proceeds from that sale should be used only to buy something where you want to live even if you have to finance the rest,Mentalcomposer
the country house would be a wonderful place to have as a respite from every day life in a city,Mentalcomposer
talk to her it seems theres more to this is she looking at expensive luxury apts when you normally wouldnt be able to afford and wants that as status,Mentalcomposer
you should have cancelled the weekend with your sister on wed or thursday when you realized you are not up to having visitors,Mentalcomposer
idk about the secondary stress but if you cant even get off the couch i really hope your sister isnt expecting you to entertain her and the kids,Mentalcomposer
why would she even want to come if you are so sick thats just risking her and or the kids getting sick also,Mentalcomposer
do yourself a favor and lock yourself in your bedroom until you feel well enough sis can use your home as a base and take the kids out to do whatever she wants and she can feed them on her own also i would never still visit if i knew my sister was so sick your sister is being selfish,Mentalcomposer
thank you for that,Mentalcomposer
it would take a bit of getting used to for sure,Mentalcomposer
nobody thinks how parents feel when the kids move away for their careers or just because they want to try living elsewhere,Mentalcomposer
and i think it really depends on how often you saw them were in the same state as our parents and sibs but they both live an hour away we see them a few times a year each holidays birthdays etc,Mentalcomposer
we def think about that when we talk of moving away like how often do we really see everyone and we can just travel back,Mentalcomposer
yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd,Mentalcomposer
were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off,Mentalcomposer
why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos,Mentalcomposer
and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can,Mentalcomposer
yeah the whole thing with the cab and go pro was odd,Mentalcomposer
were they originally stopped for a red light or did they just get into the cab either way you get in and take off,Mentalcomposer
why would the security guy in the cab get out to try to shoo away the one guy all that did was make the cab stay stopped for a longer time thus more photos,Mentalcomposer
and none of the three of them even tried to hide their faces if you want to make the pics unusable you dont give them a shot you give them the most unusable pose you can,Mentalcomposer
i had heard it was because in coed classes the boys were getting more attention from educators and the girls were kind of getting lost in the shuffle,Mentalcomposer
boys called on more for answers girls questions not being explained to satisfaction those sorts of things,Mentalcomposer
so having all girls would let them be more involved in the lessons or discussions,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see with sending the photos to the friend is that you have no idea who else hes sharing or showing them to,Mentalcomposer
at least when your h shared he was in control im assuming by just showing the friend his phone,Mentalcomposer
and i hate to say it but you shouldnt need any affirmation from other men to make you feel good i understand missing your h but that could lead to a slippery slope and you might not even notice it happening,Mentalcomposer
i would let h know and hope hed blast the friend and i would let the friend know what his gf said,Mentalcomposer
then id send a scathing text to gf then block her and the friend,Mentalcomposer
so wait was there even any paparazzi trying to follow them,Mentalcomposer
the article says they didnt want it known where they were staying so they were driven around for a over an hour overkill much,Mentalcomposer
but was there anyone actually even following them it doesnt actually say that,Mentalcomposer
so then what go to the police station to what wait for another car oh and they had to be escorted to the next block before they could get into them other car,Mentalcomposer
these two are only important in their own minds,Mentalcomposer
so much drama for absolutely nothing this chick lives for pictures of her was she afraid someone was gonna break into her hotel room  gmafb,Mentalcomposer
dont be so quick to judge lots of younger kids gain a lot of weight right before they have a growth spurt where their weight evens out with their height,Mentalcomposer
but when i see older kids within a family and all of them are overly big then i wonder why the parents werent more conscious of the kids at least like they can be however big they want but wouldnt you want better for the kids,Mentalcomposer
sandals are even better than sneakers if you have a lightweight button down that looks great with shorts too roll up the sleeves,Mentalcomposer
the idea that you both have to see other people in order to know that you want to be with each other permanently makes no sense to me,Mentalcomposer
there will always be someone else that either of you could fall in love with and that person becomes the one the idea is that when you find a person you want to commit forever to you stop looking,Mentalcomposer
but you two are young have been together since youre teens so basically what youre both saying is,Mentalcomposer
you both want to play the field sleep around and see if theres someone better out there because you havent and you dont want to regret it,Mentalcomposer
and thats fine to want to most people do that in their teens until their mid 20s or longer,Mentalcomposer
just realize this be honest and verbalize this,Mentalcomposer
if you want to pretend that dating others will be the catalyst to losing weight and solidifying that your current partner is actually the one you might be surprised with the reality and are you both prepared for that,Mentalcomposer
i think it depends on what youre doing after the grad ceremony,Mentalcomposer
if youre going to a lunch at a decently nice restaurant then please dress accordingly,Mentalcomposer
if youre only going to the ceremony to be there for a friend and not going out afterward then i think its ok,Mentalcomposer
but actually i hate flip flops in public especially on men so i really think you should put sneakers on,Mentalcomposer
how about nicer shorts a polo and a pair of sneakers  youre still comfy but look like you made an effort,Mentalcomposer
there are a lot of recipes that  hide veggies in regular meals try to look up some of them at least hell be getting some nutrients that way,Mentalcomposer
one i know is shredding carrot into meatloaf so things like that,Mentalcomposer
is it just a case of him not used to these veggies,Mentalcomposer
maybe try to get some veggies that he would have from his home country so hes at least eating something healthy,Mentalcomposer
does he eat fruit its not a substitute but its good for him at least,Mentalcomposer
then you can try to introduce new ones,Mentalcomposer
be patient everything is new to him and hes only 10,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
how long are you dating,Mentalcomposer
and is this your first serious relationship,Mentalcomposer
if you care for this woman at all you would let her go,Mentalcomposer
you want to go back to normal but verbal abuse has no place in a relationship,Mentalcomposer
you admit you have verbally abused her for all 4 yrs of this relationship you are not a good partner because of your anger issues,Mentalcomposer
you need to stay single get some help for your anger issues and only then should you try to have another relationship,Mentalcomposer
you cannot solve your issues on your own and asking this woman to be abused more from you is cruel,Mentalcomposer
late to this thread but ive heard this is a new thing ccl is doing,Mentalcomposer
its not so much an offer anyone can earn it,Mentalcomposer
i read something about it but i think,Mentalcomposer
it works this way,Mentalcomposer
as you gamble on the ship you accrue points you always had an option to convert these points to free play while on the same sailing points do not transfer to another sailing so it didnt make much sense not to convert them you did however earn some perks on the sailing ie at 1500 points you get free drinks in the casino you might get a steakhouse dinner or a spa service but idk how many points you needed for any of them,Mentalcomposer
now however the new plan is that if you do not convert your points you are supposed to be given a certificate for the above amounts depending on how many points you earn,Mentalcomposer
but i believe these certificates are used for a future cruise,Mentalcomposer
so is it worth it idk but i just play whatever i would normally play and whatever i get i get i wouldnt overspend my budget just to get to the next level of points,Mentalcomposer
im harsh because honestly im gonna take care of me first,Mentalcomposer
what he does after you break up with him is of no concern of yours,Mentalcomposer
at this point id send a text tell him its over youre done tell him to get some help,Mentalcomposer
then block him everywhere,Mentalcomposer
and all those friends who hate you now once you block him you can give them a heads up that its their turn to take care of him you know since they care so much then block them too you dont need these people in your life id rather have no friends,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its not your parents event idc who is paying for it,Mentalcomposer
your fsil said pants or a dress so you can wear the pantsuit and i dont know you but a pantsuit will look great on you,Mentalcomposer
go and have a great time and after the wedding try and keep in touch more with bro and sil,Mentalcomposer
i have found that once i really get to know a potential romantic partner their attractiveness or lack of becomes a non issue like their personality just meshes so well with me that they in turn become sort of better looking in my eyes if that makes any sense  i know this person would not be on anyones top 10 good looking list but that one trait just isnt a dealbreaker compared to the immense feelings when im with this person,Mentalcomposer
but if youre talking about do i have to find my partner attractive all day every day  no we all go thru periods when were not looking our best did we gain weight happen to get a horrible haircut that changes the way we look did we radically change the clothes we wear cause were in a weird fashion phase,Mentalcomposer
those types of things come and go,Mentalcomposer
take a good look at your partner when theyre all slack and sleeping probably not the best look but that is them in a raw sort of way,Mentalcomposer
im thinking it wasnt malicious more so that the two of you you and sil are the babys main caregivers,Mentalcomposer
not great wording by mil,Mentalcomposer
i love my mil but i would have laughed and said something sarcastically funny like  wait im the mom i did the labor and have the body to prove it or said to sil  ok you get her when she wont stop crying since were sharing anyway,Mentalcomposer
i cannot fathom why your h and bil were included unless the gift was a ticket for each of you to go out somewhere together,Mentalcomposer
are you gonna get a fathers day gift too,Mentalcomposer
honestly i usually dont  care if the story itself is a bit disjointed ill see if it evens out or ill even reread a sentence that sounds odd to figure out what theyre trying to say but spelling errors are a non starter for me,Mentalcomposer
a random one here or there ok,Mentalcomposer
constantly nope i just stop reading,Mentalcomposer
you want to be a writer ffs learn to spell or get even a friend to read just for spelling errors,Mentalcomposer
i want to know why you want to do this,Mentalcomposer
are you gonna wake up and have a couple shots in the morning or wait before bed,Mentalcomposer
there is absolutely no good reason for you to do this,Mentalcomposer
are you making up for lost time do you think itll make you a grown up what,Mentalcomposer
this just seems like a weird ritual to start,Mentalcomposer
this is what i would and have told my daughter,Mentalcomposer
he can be frustrated and rant and rave  about that thing but he has absolutely no right to take it out on you,Mentalcomposer
get up and leave,Mentalcomposer
you do not sit there and take it,Mentalcomposer
you need to draw a line with him tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not be treated in this way,Mentalcomposer
this is your first bf know your worth and what you are willing to put up with and what you are not and this is not one saying sorry does not negate the fact that he scares and hurts you,Mentalcomposer
there are other guys out there,Mentalcomposer
oh yes i watch a lot of news programs,Mentalcomposer
the one thing that always gets me talking back to the tv is when anyone usually politicians are on there telling me again what the problem is and blaming someone else usually the other party,Mentalcomposer
so ok we all know the problem so instead of blaming someone else tell me what you propose as a solution,Mentalcomposer
id rather listen to a ridiculous idea than no idea,Mentalcomposer
just give her back the money for her ticket and take someone else,Mentalcomposer
wow had no idea about any of that so thank you,Mentalcomposer
id be up for building a bigger building,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to have a high credit line but you could call your cc and ask them to increase it for a medical emergency,Mentalcomposer
it might be helpful to call before hand and ask if thats something they could do in the event of an emergency maybe explain that you have insurance and can prove that so they know you will have the means to repay,Mentalcomposer
my policy is a pay now and get reimbursed so if i have to go to the ships doctor i pay and then submit for reimbursement,Mentalcomposer
but for example medical evac i call the insurance and they make the arrangements im not expected to lay out half a million for that,Mentalcomposer
what form of govt do we move towards,Mentalcomposer
correct me if im wrong but the system we have now was laid out in the constitution so in order to change it to something else wed have to effectively dismantle the constitution,Mentalcomposer
keep the good parts and change the bad parts,Mentalcomposer
that will never happen,Mentalcomposer
our system should work there are adequate checks and balances to keep things on the up and up,Mentalcomposer
but individual interests are always going to take precedent over the greater good,Mentalcomposer
im certainly not educated enough to know where it all went wrong and i suspect its been a long time of small incremental changes that have got us where we are today,Mentalcomposer
but it would be an interesting discussion,Mentalcomposer
from what i read and see middletown township has a really great special needs program like people move here just for that,Mentalcomposer
the problem is there arent a lot of rentals around and home prices are high,Mentalcomposer
id suggest getting a list of school districts checking out col see if you can afford to live there and take into account what your commute would be and if you can find anything about their special needs programs  dont know if its published but then join the facebook group for those towns or cities and ask there,Mentalcomposer
ive seen moms ask and the responses have been overwhelmingly positive those that have been thru it are the most knowledgeable of the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
i think i remember it being this way,Mentalcomposer
hospitals were so wildly overcrowded that the idea was that anyone who came from a nursing home and was deemed stable or on the way to recovery could be sent back to finish their recovery in the nh,Mentalcomposer
but the caveat was that the nh was supposed to be able to segregate these patients away from the other residents until they were no longer able to infect others,Mentalcomposer
if youve ever visited a nh youd realize that this is impossible to do,Mentalcomposer
besides there being no empty rooms usually each resident has an assigned room and as is the case with older residents they know where they belong,Mentalcomposer
suddenly moving not sick patients out of their room in order to use that room for a recovering but sick resident will not go over well and vice versa  moving sick out of their room,Mentalcomposer
so i think nhs took back recovering residents either thinking they could make it work or knowing they couldnt but were getting so much pressure to alleviate the hospitals burden or the nh only gets paid from medicare when the resident is actually in house that they didnt want to forgo that payment,Mentalcomposer
i have a relative in a nh and i will say there is no way to stop the spread of any communicable illness most of the residents dont even ever leave the home even just to be outside on the patio some more mobile residents can get themselves out there but most need assistance and the staff cant be bothered and there are never any windows opened luckily mine never caught covid during the major surge but we suspect she had it prior,Mentalcomposer
i get that she thinks shell get a payout but it comes up so often that kc will be the one who pays that it just gets on my last nerve,Mentalcomposer
again with kc paying her out,Mentalcomposer
i really dont understand what the rationale for this would be,Mentalcomposer
even if she has an nda shell never stop she will find a way to get whatever she wants to get out to get out another leaked letter to a friend anonymous friend source spilling info cryptic statements,Mentalcomposer
it is not kcs responsibility to get rid of her,Mentalcomposer
what could she really know at this point nothing so earth shattering damaging to anyone but harry and i have no problem if she drags him thru the mud its just karma coming back to him,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
personally moms attitude is crappy,Mentalcomposer
you are supposed to fund a gift and a dinner for 4 people,Mentalcomposer
just make her lunch at home and be done with it,Mentalcomposer
shes taking this mothers day thing way too far considering she only has 1 kid who has a job,Mentalcomposer
shes never going to see your side of it she needs to be right more than she needs a relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
your partner needs to stop entertaining his mom he needs to tell her if she has something to say to you she should say it to you not him and hes ending any conversation that goes that way,Mentalcomposer
shell either get in touch with you or not but your h being the go between at this point is ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter,Mentalcomposer
dont analyze someone you are not dating its exhausting,Mentalcomposer
move on,Mentalcomposer
nobody should have any patience for a constant on off relationship we either want to be together and resolve our issues or we go our separate ways,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you have two other kids in that house that you need to protect not that they need to know,Mentalcomposer
i say you have every right to ask,Mentalcomposer
hes living with you and you are caring for him through this tumultuous time in his life he should trust you enough with the information,Mentalcomposer
but dont say that and just accept if he wont share his diagnosis,Mentalcomposer
tablecloths because i hate to see the fold marks when its on the table,Mentalcomposer
nta for keeping the letters i would have also,Mentalcomposer
do you forgive him the problem with lying is that once they lie you dont know what if anything else is true,Mentalcomposer
only you can decide if your relationship is real with him or not,Mentalcomposer
what did he say about all of this why lie about having a gf whyd he keep the letters what did she mean to him,Mentalcomposer
i have an idea about why he lied but id like to know what he said,Mentalcomposer
so im a lot behind on this whole story so if someone could explain please,Mentalcomposer
phone hacking i agree would be something to sue over,Mentalcomposer
but paying for a pi to get info any him or anyone else just seems to me like its a normal course of events,Mentalcomposer
so for example if im a tabloid or even just a newspaper how else could i report on a celebs activities if i didnt know where they would be seems like to hire someone to follow them would be par for the course,Mentalcomposer
also the suspicious phone calls what made them suspicious were they hang ups were they asking for confirmation if the subject was going to be at a particular party ceremony etc,Mentalcomposer
sorry but other than the hacking is hiring a pi even if its to follow someone illegal,Mentalcomposer
walk the strip and go into each casino hotel its fun to see the diff theming,Mentalcomposer
nta for trying,Mentalcomposer
but i dont think its going to do any good,Mentalcomposer
you can try to occupy him when its usually  her days but shell just change up her schedule,Mentalcomposer
the fact that he proposed a poly says that he isnt willing to stop seeing her and that is the real issue why hasnt he if he knows you are not happy with her specifically why isnt he putting your marriage first,Mentalcomposer
what did he say when you said no to a poly situation,Mentalcomposer
she sounds a bit unhinged youre getting in the way of  true love and  its gods will,Mentalcomposer
does he not think these missives are a problem,Mentalcomposer
he may well be miserable in the gloomy grey cold winter time its a thing,Mentalcomposer
but also some people dont need to see their so every day,Mentalcomposer
you guys see each other at work so theres no reason you need to be seeing each other every night also,Mentalcomposer
when do you see your friends do laundry grocery shop,Mentalcomposer
pick one week night and make that your night wed is good its right in the middle then you can decide if and what youre going to do on the weekend,Mentalcomposer
hes telling you its too much not that he never wants to see you again give him space,Mentalcomposer
so basically you just dont want him to show up on mothers day with a gift from your kids and then you all go to his moms like youve always done because you had a fight and are,Mentalcomposer
still not talking,Mentalcomposer
if you successfully dodge him on moms day and he gets in touch on monday what are you going to do,Mentalcomposer
it seems like youre trying to punish him by making him go to his moms alone,Mentalcomposer
as for the picture chances are his d is putting hers in front of yours find another spot,Mentalcomposer
you dont want to go on vacay with his parents bc of whatever happened last year fine but has that situation been resolved at all if not why would you ever entertain mothers day with his mom,Mentalcomposer
no key did you ask for it back or were you waiting for him to make a grand gesture over it,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot of passive aggressive going on here,Mentalcomposer
speak up use your words,Mentalcomposer
look its been 9 years it either works or it doesnt and it seems like it doesnt work maybe it did for a time but realize this both your and his kids are seeing this and im sure its not the first time,Mentalcomposer
this is the way,Mentalcomposer
this is all what he thinks,Mentalcomposer
theres not one iota of what he says that would show that he actually knows for a fact that the kids watched or that the non existent party happened or that h tucked anyone into bed that night,Mentalcomposer
so basically this is a non story,Mentalcomposer
its really easy for anyone to say what someone else would do or thought or felt but those  ideas are based off of what we ourselves would think or do or feel,Mentalcomposer
why even give this guy any interviews have they not caught on that hes not reliable at this point,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
did they actually say that,Mentalcomposer
do they really expect you to never have another partner that you should be alone and lonely while they go off and make their lives,Mentalcomposer
were not talking about children here who are still living home they should have some semblance of sharing a life with someone especially the 29 yo,Mentalcomposer
so if any of their marriages dont work out they are never going to look for another partner because they might be replacing the first one,Mentalcomposer
your kids are being selfish by denying you the happiness you deserve,Mentalcomposer
and im over here pushing my step dad to move on and its been over 10 years since my mom passed i want him to have someone to share his life with why should he be alone,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your dad sure is,Mentalcomposer
the first person he should have told is his wife,Mentalcomposer
what does he hope to accomplish my telling you kids first,Mentalcomposer
is he hoping one of you will tell mom so he doesnt have to,Mentalcomposer
he makes no sense at all  what if he tells you all and takes his sweet time telling mom do we all just pretend all is well,Mentalcomposer
mom might not see it coming  but shes been as unhappy as him she might welcome the divorce,Mentalcomposer
i need to know how this person knows their partner did the partner move to nigeria after an in person relationship or is this an online thing,Mentalcomposer
if its online absolutely no way in hell should a parent leave their child to go meet someone they have never met and i dont care which country it is,Mentalcomposer
but doubly if the country could be dangerous,Mentalcomposer
if its a case of knowing this person and they had to live for a legit reason like a job then i might go but my partner would need to meet me at the airport and not leave me alone in an unfamiliar country doubly if its a dangerous country,Mentalcomposer
come on this is basic common sense even if i didnt have a child why would i put myself in a dangerous situation in a foreign country,Mentalcomposer
i have no idea if nigeria is dangerous to travel to i got the sense that you think its dangerous,Mentalcomposer
yeah and we have no idea if thats really what he said ive seen 3 or 4 diff interpretations of the lip readers,Mentalcomposer
i dont trust any of them,Mentalcomposer
i do find it hard to believe that h would talk about either his fam or m in this way so freely with jack unless they have been in regular contact like was jack asking how are you and h went into a litany of complaints,Mentalcomposer
or has jack been privy to any ongoing crap with m or the fam that theyve previously spoke about,Mentalcomposer
i didnt think they had that kind of relationship if they do it would be the only secret either harkle ever kept,Mentalcomposer
does your h understand that your dr has not cleared you to go back to work  theres clearly a reason for this,Mentalcomposer
explain it to him again in plain english obviously his advanced degree isnt in english,Mentalcomposer
i will never be able to go back to my high paying job that i love that supports this family if i do not get myself mentally healthy in order to get healthy i need to rest and rest means not working a crappy job while you refuse to be a partner to me and a responsible dad to our children the answer to this is that you take over being the support of this family as i have been for the past 10 years,Mentalcomposer
if you cannot do that then you are not the man i thought i married that man would be worried that i had an actual mental breakdown at work that man would be doing everything in his power to support me until i am better and able to resume my career if that is not you then tell me now and ill figure out what my next steps should be because i cannot go on like this,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i cannot understand your husbands attitude at all,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand why anyone would change majors just because they arent getting straight as,Mentalcomposer
that was the first mistake your kid made straight bs gets the same diploma as as,Mentalcomposer
so they changed majors to something they didnt even like thats the second mistake,Mentalcomposer
so now theyre miserable,Mentalcomposer
just let the kid quit this job if they keep getting bad reviews they wont have a job and they wont have a god recommendation either,Mentalcomposer
let them come home get some therapy if they need it and let them figure it out from there,Mentalcomposer
this isnt a hard decision,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
first off quit whatever job you have your health is more important,Mentalcomposer
does your h at least agree with the fact that the household needs an income that covers your bills and even more importantly has benefits that cover your medically fragile child,Mentalcomposer
this is a man who has a masters degree and is confused as to why he needs to get a job,Mentalcomposer
so what exactly does he think the solution should be,Mentalcomposer
too bad if its going to hurt her someone always is going to be upset in a breakup better her than you,Mentalcomposer
break up block her everywhere and move on youll be better for it,Mentalcomposer
no because in order for her kids to experience anything like this she would be forced to volunteer,Mentalcomposer
you know like an actual act of service,Mentalcomposer
and not get paid for doing it,Mentalcomposer
oh the horror,Mentalcomposer
youre missing the point here,Mentalcomposer
establishing paternity is in your childs best interest,Mentalcomposer
if he is the father then you can file for support thru the courts and he will have to pay that benefits your child,Mentalcomposer
but if you just want to keep going back and forth with him he will not just hand you money for the baby every month as he has proven,Mentalcomposer
split the cost of the test,Mentalcomposer
massive massive yta,Mentalcomposer
in the event this is actually true which i doubt strongly because no one can be this out of touch,Mentalcomposer
what exactly do you and your wife do in regards to your kids,Mentalcomposer
your bro has been doing literally everything for your kids,Mentalcomposer
between you and your wife you dont even bathe and put the kids to bed,Mentalcomposer
how exactly is him doing the kids laundry going to help you out so much  seems to me you have an over abundance of free time after work and on the weekends since you dont do anything else,Mentalcomposer
you do realize he has a job and a life that doesnt revolve around your kids,Mentalcomposer
i really hope he just leaves in the middle of the night id love to see how that next morning goes,Mentalcomposer
so he asks if her robe is heavy whatever she said made him instantly uncomfortable,Mentalcomposer
maybe it was something like its a small sacrifice for the family crownfamily or service is a huge weight to bare,Mentalcomposer
or she really dug in with something like  youd know if you stuck around,Mentalcomposer
no theres nothing to be embarrassed about,Mentalcomposer
this relationship isnt doing it for you anymore,Mentalcomposer
youre thinking is that there has to be a big reason to break up with someone but you can break up with someone for any or no reason,Mentalcomposer
dont stay with her or anyone you are not 100 invested in  its not fair to you or them,Mentalcomposer
found this,Mentalcomposer
he needs to see a dentist and a doctor,Mentalcomposer
its possible that at 18 this ldr satisfied your emotional needs and even just seeing each other intermittently was doing it,Mentalcomposer
it may be tho that at 20 it isnt satisfying your needs and you need a partner in closer proximity,Mentalcomposer
or youre just really bored with this girl it happens,Mentalcomposer
have you tried redirecting the conversation or has your wife,Mentalcomposer
do the other men also add to these little anecdotes,Mentalcomposer
sex conversations will and have come up occasionally but they are short lived and not every time were with friends  thats an odd topic to always come up,Mentalcomposer
maybe the other women keep bringing it up because your wife never has anything to share theyre trying to figure her out,Mentalcomposer
your issue is your frustration with your sex life not that your wife laughs along with the conversation,Mentalcomposer
its been 8 years you must have some idea what is holding your wife back is it something that can even be fixed with therapy if not all the therapy in the world will do no good,Mentalcomposer
maybe you as a couple should see an actual sex therapist,Mentalcomposer
gf is tah for not deleting the pic as soon as asked especially bc they know op doesnt want them to have those type of pics,Mentalcomposer
and op is tah for physically restraining the gf  it should not have had to get to that point but gf did challenge op to come get it and they did,Mentalcomposer
so it seems as if your parents and his know each other  do they speak often,Mentalcomposer
i ask because you said you argue with your parents over something and once they see they have no reasonable reason to say no they back down and you get your way,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if your parents can explain to his parents why they are ok with this trip and maybe that would help his parents get on board,Mentalcomposer
i understand its cultural but you both have the same cultural norms yet your parents are being more tolerable,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
just the fact that she didnt delete it as soon as you asked is a problem for me especially that youve already had this conversation,Mentalcomposer
today its a picture what is tomorrow boundary break going to be,Mentalcomposer
i,Mentalcomposer
have to trust that my partner is going to respect me enough to not do things i specifically ask them not to,Mentalcomposer
ywbta if you say anything now,Mentalcomposer
this family is your uncles wifes  no,Mentalcomposer
why would these people even be invited to your wedding,Mentalcomposer
i can understand being close to an uncle and his wife but her family other then saying hi and bye at occasions your uncle has you can absolutely not invite them,Mentalcomposer
plus youre no where close to even getting married so leave it for now,Mentalcomposer
i have no judgement because honestly i am not understanding this,Mentalcomposer
your friend wanted you to design her wedding invitations,Mentalcomposer
were you supposed to draw or write one invite and then shed what make photocopies and send them out,Mentalcomposer
were you supposed to hand write all the invites,Mentalcomposer
is there a reason she didnt just order invitations,Mentalcomposer
i would think he would be invited with a plus 1 and that would be you,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt expect to receive my own invite to weddings of his friends or family,Mentalcomposer
you can always ask at least for his brother  wont you have to make arrangements with work,Mentalcomposer
yes i am in the hopeless phase right now im in the having it all planned out in my head and just need to start phase,Mentalcomposer
dont give up just yet,Mentalcomposer
youre doing well with breakfast and lunch its just dinner thats messing,Mentalcomposer
you up,Mentalcomposer
so maybe try telling your wife thats a problem shes going to have to be supportive of what youre trying to do or this wont work,Mentalcomposer
you can go out to eat but watch what you order have a salad before your meal chicken or fish and a veg,Mentalcomposer
then when your meal comes half everything in the plate only eat that and ask for a take away box thats tomorrows dinner box it up and be done have a coffee after dinner and maybe a few bites of your wifes desert,Mentalcomposer
when youre going to eat at home youre going to have to plan for it,Mentalcomposer
grill up a bunch of chicken on sunday use that for a day or two add a salad or a veg,Mentalcomposer
its ok if you and wife dont eat the same things every night there were plenty of times i cooked for the fam and ate a salad and added a protein,Mentalcomposer
i almost always snack on nuts in the evening if i just need something to nosh on i find they satisfy that need with a small portion,Mentalcomposer
youre doing so well all day long dont let the one evening meal mess it all up,Mentalcomposer
this was your tipping point,Mentalcomposer
not the time you spent working while planning for and having a baby and he did  nothing but tag along on vacation while you worked was that part of your plan you can have a year off with the baby so he gets one too,Mentalcomposer
im gonna guess that he isnt making the same money you did and thats why you need to have such a tight budget but did either of you think maybe he should have been working last year and you could have built up some savings,Mentalcomposer
you had a plan but it had some holes in it im afraid this is going to be a very long year for you,Mentalcomposer
youve been stuck for several years coincidently youve been with the bf for several years,Mentalcomposer
is it possible that part of your dissatisfaction is that you cut your traveling plan short to stay with your bf and youre wanderlust is creeping back in,Mentalcomposer
you have been working so its not as if,Mentalcomposer
hes been supporting you not everybody is going to be so career driven or always have another goal to reach a lot of people just fall into a career find its pretty ok and stay with it,Mentalcomposer
no one can tell you what you should do with your life but you like traveling and have had a passion for it so maybe try to find something in the travel planning sector  or work for an airline to get the travel benefits,Mentalcomposer
theres also online teaching english which might be better than in class,Mentalcomposer
i think theres some kind of test you can take that shows what you have an aptitude for you might try that and see if it gives you any ideas otherwise just look at some job sites and see if anything sparks your interest you might get lucky and find something,Mentalcomposer
what has he tried to do to get his weight under control that after 2 years he hasnt been able to find something he can stick with,Mentalcomposer
we all know exactly what we have to do to lose weight and control our cravings and a lot of us just cant be bothered but when it becomes an actual medical issue thats when it shocks us into action is he not actually scared about this health issue why not,Mentalcomposer
you have to decide if you are ok with a relationship of no sex and a man 10 years older with health issues,Mentalcomposer
at 24 it would be a no from me,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a serious talk with your bf,Mentalcomposer
he wants to move and you dont have you discussed this at all have you told him why you want to stay your job daycare and family support,Mentalcomposer
what could he say to counter that,Mentalcomposer
you live together but are on and off how does that work when youre off does one of you stay somewhere else  or do you just ignore each other on the regular while still living in the same place,Mentalcomposer
look this relationship doesnt sound very stable its good that you are conscious of stability for not just you but also your child but buying a house on your own with no discussion will not go over well at all and i could absolutely understand that from his point of view,Mentalcomposer
have the tough conversations now nobody wants to have them but you need to figure out what is going on with your relationship because honestly it seems like neither one of you are all that committed to the other,Mentalcomposer
once you figure that out a plan going forward will quickly emerge youll either both want to stay together and youll buy a house together or youll go your separate ways and figure out visitation and child support,Mentalcomposer
whichever way it goes at least youre both not in limbo,Mentalcomposer
thats the only way i like them firm and crunchy  or dried is really good too,Mentalcomposer
but i like all my fruit like that theres something so gross to bite into a fruit and the juice goes everywhere,Mentalcomposer
we only do it for final jeopardy if we need time to decipher the clue,Mentalcomposer
during the game we just yell out the answers,Mentalcomposer
your art is stunning,Mentalcomposer
you are very talented,Mentalcomposer
so he keeps saying he wants someone on the same level as him in regards to some very specific things,Mentalcomposer
has it occurred to you that he threatens divorce just so you will bend to his every whim,Mentalcomposer
do you find yourself changing things you do after he threatens,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have to put up with a looming threat over your head every single the day from the person who is supposed to love you the most,Mentalcomposer
id tell him the next time he brings up divorce is the day i will be finding a lawyer he needs to find a better way of communicating,Mentalcomposer
the old heshe loves me so much they want to spend all their time with me excuse,Mentalcomposer
no its weird and controlling,Mentalcomposer
5 pm for preschool yikes,Mentalcomposer
i still wouldnt do it its not your job,Mentalcomposer
and frankly you went to school to be a teacher not a bus monitor,Mentalcomposer
i cant believe the other teachers dont feel the exact same way,Mentalcomposer
this is an assistant problem they can figure it out id remove myself from the situation give the assistants the number to call for a sub bus monitor and be done,Mentalcomposer
if they cant get a sub one day then one of them does it you know because its their job,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
so greeting guests means what after church when we walked out we stayed by the church doors and as the guests filed out we greeted them thanked them for coming and they have their congrats but this was both,Mentalcomposer
sets of parents then leading up to us,Mentalcomposer
if this is what youre doing why would you not have stepmom standing right next to dad while receiving guests if greeting guests is a mob thing then id think its a fob thing also are your new inlaws in this receiving line also,Mentalcomposer
and its really not all that much trouble to have her in the room where youre getting ready im assuming your bridesmaids will be there also,Mentalcomposer
this one seems petty to me like theres not really a reason for it other than exclusion,Mentalcomposer
and lastly ive never seen anyone but the best man give any kind of speech at a wedding but that could just be the norm where im from,Mentalcomposer
if your dad is making a speech then sm can stand up there with him she doesnt have to talk but its the acknowledgement that they are together and shes a part of your life and his speech should reflect on that,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt do bus duty either if its not part of my job,Mentalcomposer
as a lead im sure you have other teacher duties that you need to do after school or at home thats the stuff you do and assistants do the bus,Mentalcomposer
you have 4 assistants its their job so they can take an extra day each week,Mentalcomposer
i would just tell all of them not my job i get car sick and im not doing it they are free to do whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
what time does school end that you get back at 6 pm,Mentalcomposer
this is really odd to me tho where i live the bus company hires drivers and aides for the bus,Mentalcomposer
any change in how they see him is only gonna change  if they see him,Mentalcomposer
so if he wants any relationship with your fam he needs to start showing up,Mentalcomposer
thats really all there is to it,Mentalcomposer
so now im curious does she print her signature on everything,Mentalcomposer
like im thinking a drivers license or bank acct application,Mentalcomposer
my youngest is 26 and they were taught cursive,Mentalcomposer
the ex is certainly taking up a lot of space in your head,Mentalcomposer
why is that are you not secure enough with your bf  how does she ever come up in conversation and what did he say when he told you she misses him,Mentalcomposer
but if you just want to break up to save yourself some drama then thats perfectly ok also it may be your intuition telling you that this isnt a forever thing not that hes cheating or anything more a feeling of shes always gonna be lurking somewhere and you just dont want to deal with it,Mentalcomposer
and honestly it doesnt seem like youd be all that hurt if you do break up so maybe youre not as invested which is good,Mentalcomposer
ill tell you this tho if you decide to stay make sure you go to every family function make yourself seen shes thinking she intimidated you into not going and shes right treat her like shes any other of sisters friend,Mentalcomposer
thats not really an ultimatum tho he hasnt really given you any indication hes into you but you keep trying anyway why im sure hes a great guy but theres not much coming from him,Mentalcomposer
his indifference is telling you all you need to know,Mentalcomposer
hes not the last guy in the world find someone who actually wants to be with you and stop wasting your time,Mentalcomposer
do you really want to be with someone that you have to chase until he just gives in then youll be here all sad because you chased and chased finally got him but it isnt the grand love affair you envisioned,Mentalcomposer
so its not really about having an independent life its all about having a partner,Mentalcomposer
well to attract a partner you need to be a good partner,Mentalcomposer
your mh is bad but you arent getting help for it,Mentalcomposer
you had a job but they cut your hours so you just stopped showing up instead of getting a part time job since you had extra time to work,Mentalcomposer
take a second and just stop and think what you need to do to get where you want to be,Mentalcomposer
ask for help if you need but no one else can just give you a life you have to make one just like every other person,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
hes 6  hes not a man and you shouldnt be trying to teach him to be a man at his age,Mentalcomposer
honestly you sound terrible,Mentalcomposer
you can disagree with a book he reads or any other issue but you have a normal rational conversation with his mother and come to a mutual decision,Mentalcomposer
she left over this even if its for a night shes got enough sense to leave when you show how absolutely unreasonable you can be next time she may not come back,Mentalcomposer
i mean no offense but is there something about your autism that makes you not able to live independently and if you dont mind how old are you,Mentalcomposer
you need 2 things,Mentalcomposer
a job and an apartment,Mentalcomposer
do you have a job if yes then stay where you are for now and save as much as you can,Mentalcomposer
if no then figure out what you can or want to do and start looking for that work,Mentalcomposer
if you cant find what youre looking for right now take any job the idea is to just start having an income,Mentalcomposer
after you save enough money then you can begin to look for an apt and a room mate or two,Mentalcomposer
then come back here and ask how much you can afford to pay in rent based on your income and well help you figure that out also,Mentalcomposer
i think you over reacted to this situation she was with her bf who i assume you trust since he stays at your home sometimes,Mentalcomposer
i can track all my adult kids and only 2 still live at home but i rarely do because they tell me whats going on just like your d did  we just always had it since they were teens,Mentalcomposer
why would you check that she made it to work what if she just up and decides one day she wants to skip work and go to a park are you gonna go to the park and make sure shes ok,Mentalcomposer
leave her alone shes an adult and doesnt need you constantly on top of her,Mentalcomposer
tracking is for when they up and disappears and i can tell the police where the last location was but even then the cops can get more info than i can anyway,Mentalcomposer
its not just rich people who want more money its pretty much all people,Mentalcomposer
there are exceptions of course,Mentalcomposer
some people are very content with what they have and arent always looking for more,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
im just sitting here baffled that the h is actually complaining to his wife that he has to find a new job because wife told gfs husband about the affair,Mentalcomposer
like how is this even a regular conversation between them,Mentalcomposer
what should you do,Mentalcomposer
you turn to her and tell her,Mentalcomposer
cut the crap stop your crying like a baby because i saw an a on tv if you cannot get your insecurity under control this isnt gonna work go see someone if you need to ive been more than patient over the last 4 years but my patience is wearing thin and im tired of it now were here to have a good time and im not putting up with this you can go back home if youre going to be miserable for the next 4 days over something that literally literally does not affect either one of us,Mentalcomposer
and then you stuck to that stop giving in to her,Mentalcomposer
this might be the most absolutely ridiculous thing ive ever read on reditt and we all know the ridiculousness that is on this site,Mentalcomposer
keep in mind that while you would be ok with not having any contact with your family she isnt you and when faced with that choice i think a lot of people wouldnt,Mentalcomposer
so she cuts off her whole family and then what she has you and only you you cannot possibly no matter how hard you try replace a motherfather and siblings,Mentalcomposer
those are unique relationships that for most people cannot be replaced,Mentalcomposer
take some time to get over her and try to let go of some of the anger you have thinking that you were so easily discarded this was probably extremely hard for her to do,Mentalcomposer
life goes on and this too shall pass,Mentalcomposer
im sorry youre dealing with this,Mentalcomposer
you tell your parents what you told us here,Mentalcomposer
that theyre lovely people you love them and severing them from your life will be hard but if thats what they choose then youll abide by it,Mentalcomposer
but add that you refuse to be verbally abused by anyone at any time so they can call off the dogs,Mentalcomposer
you can add that you are absolutely positive in the fact that somewhere in their minds they know they have to know that being gay isnt a choice its the way whatever their deity is that they believe in has made you,Mentalcomposer
then you go live an absolutely wonderful life and surround yourself with people who love you being you,Mentalcomposer
please do yourself a favor and download a news app,Mentalcomposer
even if you dont read any full articles you will at least read the headlines and have a very vague idea of whats going on in the world,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what exactly does she want an apology for your wife is allowed to still be pissed and take some time she offered to drop the kids off what more does dad and wife want,Mentalcomposer
has the wife taken responsibility that what she said was done in such a way to make you and your wife look bad,Mentalcomposer
and why would she even want that,Mentalcomposer
because until she ponies up that admittance and apologizes for it theres no way id want to see her this whole fight was her doing,Mentalcomposer
no way is anyone holding my kids hostage like that grandpa will just have to get used to not seeing the kids then,Mentalcomposer
depending on the ages if the kids ask just say that grandpa is being a brat and hes in time out,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your first mistake was not having your own acct,Mentalcomposer
have a joint for bills  thats your 7030 a joint for savings  decide on an amount and each have their own,Mentalcomposer
ideally each of your paychecks should,Mentalcomposer
be deposited in your individual accts and each person transfers what they need to,Mentalcomposer
by you leaving your extra money in a joint acct you are essentially giving her free reign in that acct since she can access it but you cannot access her own acct,Mentalcomposer
how did you even agree to this,Mentalcomposer
i would say just use your new thought process of understanding to slowly work through to the next step,Mentalcomposer
dont look at the next big picture slowly work through the concepts one at a time until you have absolute command of that step then move to the next eventually the bigger picture makes sense,Mentalcomposer
abstract concepts are hard to understand is there really something to be learned in a sense if theres no definitive way of proving what the end is,Mentalcomposer
so maybe the point of your paper is to apply what you think believe to be the end result based on your individual thoughts,Mentalcomposer
im not sure this applies to you and what youre studying tho,Mentalcomposer
just to be clear hes a male 32,Mentalcomposer
your post says 32f,Mentalcomposer
hes pushing way too hard i wouldnt even keep talking to him,Mentalcomposer
youre under no real pressure from your parents to get married  right now,Mentalcomposer
but it seems that he as a 32 yo man who has up until this point hasnt found a match for himself is trying to push you into a marriage before you have even met i suspect being pressured by his parents,Mentalcomposer
stick to what you want a marriage where you are in love that means no more meeting people who do not live within a realistic amount of distance that you can actually date,Mentalcomposer
dont shortchange yourself on this picking a spouse is literally the most important decision you can make it is the one decision that can make your like a living hell if you get it wrong or can give you a lifetime of happiness if you choose right,Mentalcomposer
move to the other place take the manager spot there hire a nanny,Mentalcomposer
i dont know why you think you cant raise your child by yourself millions of women do it every day with a lot less resources than you seem to have,Mentalcomposer
youre an adult but you dont seem to want to do a lot of adulting time to step up here,Mentalcomposer
leave him to his deal with his child,Mentalcomposer
hell probably end up hiring a nanny too,Mentalcomposer
he cheated with your sister is this a man you even want to be involved with  even if he didnt know it was your sister hes an older man with a very young wife who still cheated on her what more is this guy looking for whatever it is he has proved it is not a monogamous marriage,Mentalcomposer
i usually try to explain how im understanding it and the other person will then point out where my flawed thinking is,Mentalcomposer
so id say so x does this and y does this so when x does its thing how does y know how to do their thing,Mentalcomposer
this way the other person is seeing where im getting confused and explain just that part of it so i can make the connection,Mentalcomposer
so instead of hearing the explanation that still doesnt make sense they explain just the part thats tripping me up,Mentalcomposer
and thats why neither of them should be running,Mentalcomposer
after the last 2 elections we should not still have to choose between the lesser of two old horrible candidates,Mentalcomposer
im kind of hoping there are a slew of people just throwing their hat in for both parties,Mentalcomposer
someone new might just rise to the top,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
do you even like your mom,Mentalcomposer
she wanted one thing and even paid for it,Mentalcomposer
tell work you cant make it,Mentalcomposer
you should have told work before you changed shifts that you have plans that day and needed it off,Mentalcomposer
ill bet you would have done that if you had plans for an outing with a bf or friend you wouldnt forget about those plans you wouldnt cancel on those people,Mentalcomposer
but this is just your mom and you dont even like the event so she doesnt get the same priority,Mentalcomposer
i would absolutely rat out sil to the company,Mentalcomposer
this woman is making fun of you for not being able to get a job while gloating about hers which really could have been yours if she didnt lie,Mentalcomposer
as for your sister being mean to you,Mentalcomposer
think about this,Mentalcomposer
her wife doesnt help her with any bills even tho they should be partners,Mentalcomposer
she was mean to you until you cut her off so where do you think sil put all that snark  id bet on your sister your sister probably is not standing up to her wife so shes taking out her annoyance on you getting mad at you over little things could be because she feels she cant get mad at wife,Mentalcomposer
id get sister away from wife for an afternoon and have this very needed chat is she even still happy with her wife what is really going on there,Mentalcomposer
with any luck sil will be gone and you can get your sister back,Mentalcomposer
this is not your fight,Mentalcomposer
dont use a relationship with your kids and their aunt as an excuse,Mentalcomposer
your kids have other aunts and uncles they wont be scarred for life if they dont see this one aunt as long as they are told that mom and aunt are fighting and thats why they dont talk no biggie happens to a lot of families,Mentalcomposer
your sil is finding it hard that in her mind she did everything right and just how the parents wanted got a great job and yet her sister gets all the praise  and praised for something sil probably doesnt think is such an accomplishment but thats whatever,Mentalcomposer
let your sil come around on her own time or not,Mentalcomposer
the new baby doesnt care if they meet auntie,Mentalcomposer
you cant afford decent groceries but theres money for weed,Mentalcomposer
priorities man if you cant afford your bills then every single non essential expense goes away  thats weed cable eating out etc,Mentalcomposer
if she doesnt like it she can get a job and pay for those things,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
why would you clean more than once without being paid,Mentalcomposer
its 45 hours that youre over there,Mentalcomposer
after 1 or 2 times she could have told him,Mentalcomposer
at this point shes using you shes using your labor to fund her vacation,Mentalcomposer
gtfoh,Mentalcomposer
please stop cleaning for her if shes so bothered by his messiness she can clean his apt,Mentalcomposer
id youre at the stage of a proposal you should be at the point where you can flat out ask her if she wants to give you an idea of what she likes if she wants to give you a few pictures of exactly what she wants and youll choose from that or if she wants you to just pick out the ring on your own,Mentalcomposer
the proposal will be a surprise as far as when and how,Mentalcomposer
its a phone call he has the time,Mentalcomposer
this is important to you you need to see him supporting you in this,Mentalcomposer
tell him that,Mentalcomposer
since your dad thinks the teacher was out of line he should call her,Mentalcomposer
and if your mom thinks shes out of line she should also call,Mentalcomposer
let them tell the teacher that your behavior isnt out of line or worrisome and that he doesnt appreciate her telling you it is or separating you from the class and to cut it out or hell be speaking with the admin of the school,Mentalcomposer
the very first time a partner hits me is the last time i would ever see them idc if its a man or woman doing the hitting,Mentalcomposer
it will not stop it will get worse,Mentalcomposer
get out now why would you want to be with someone who resorts to hitting when youre having an argument,Mentalcomposer
i want to know what she says the reason is that she wont get a job,Mentalcomposer
does she not realize you two cannot afford to live on your income,Mentalcomposer
id also stop buying her any special food wine and nicotine im not saying not to buy vegetarian food just not any specialty stuff,Mentalcomposer
that is not your responsibility,Mentalcomposer
honestly youve only been married 2 years id cut my losses split up and let her make her own way she is not adding anything to your life at this point,Mentalcomposer
i thought the same thing,Mentalcomposer
like what interviewer would even ask that question out of the blue why m of all the women out there it makes no sense,Mentalcomposer
the absolute only way id believe it is if the discussion somehow went to who would be a good model spokesperson for the line and since it is dm  based in the uk they asked about m to somehow tie the article to the uk through h the prince,Mentalcomposer
and then of course flip flop the quotes so it seemed as if the m question was asked first,Mentalcomposer
of course tw takes this as a win that a rockefeller even knows who she is,Mentalcomposer
she should have answered with  who,Mentalcomposer
how long are you together  and how old are you all,Mentalcomposer
if its not very long maybe he just doesnt think its that big of a deal its a lot to meet the whole fam at once,Mentalcomposer
so going to the baby birthday is his out,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure that because his friend is a girl is as big a deal as youre thinking it is this girl is with the father of her child i doubt shes looking to make moves on your bf,Mentalcomposer
your friend has im sure tried to talk to her friend about this guy and it fell on deaf ears,Mentalcomposer
there arent some magical words that are going to make her see the light now,Mentalcomposer
so julie can go be witness at this mess of a marriage or she tells friend she wants nothing to do with it but if she needs help getting away shell be there for her and have julie start saving money for that plane ticket,Mentalcomposer
what kind of guy doesnt know how to cook a hamburger or a steak,Mentalcomposer
grilled chicken is stupid easy how about a salad,Mentalcomposer
i refuse to believe he only knows how to cook those three things,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt order out just because of the expense but when its your day to cook make enough extra just for you to have it the next night,Mentalcomposer
or take a sunday and make yourself 3 or 4 portioned meals that you can heat up for when he slaves away in the kitchen and makes pancakes again,Mentalcomposer
oh no youve misunderstood his concern,Mentalcomposer
worrying about security to the spare means hes really worried that hell be swept for recording devices and  or shadowed everywhere he goes to keep him in line,Mentalcomposer
he has no fear for his personal safety he knows no one cares enough to do him harm,Mentalcomposer
so what at least hell have something to eat at home,Mentalcomposer
and she shouldnt be as stressed if shes working so she wont stress eat,Mentalcomposer
ill repeat what others have said,Mentalcomposer
do not buy a house with someone who is not your spouse,Mentalcomposer
your gf wants to buy a house get engaged and have a wedding all within the next few years oh and go on 1 or 2 big trips,Mentalcomposer
and youre supposed to fund the majority of those endeavors,Mentalcomposer
must be nice to be her,Mentalcomposer
you need to decide what you want what is your priority,Mentalcomposer
is it a house then you buy it on your own if its getting engaged and marrying then you buy a ring and ask if its travel then you plan that,Mentalcomposer
but you have to tell your gf that her pressuring you is only going to make you rethink being with her this isnt the way partners go about things,Mentalcomposer
see how she responds but if she is reluctant then you know shes looking at what she can get out of it not so much looking toward a life together,Mentalcomposer
there will be other perfect houses skip this one,Mentalcomposer
well they shouldnt have been wasting time trying to clear up a stream of errors as it relates to m,Mentalcomposer
its a ridiculous notion that above all else they felt the need to devote their time to that,Mentalcomposer
just let it go not every freakin little blip needs to or needed to be contradicted,Mentalcomposer
that was the problem they wanted so badly to make it look as if m was this perfect person that wasnt real then and it isnt real now,Mentalcomposer
i like the idea that both of you on your journeys together great thought he wont feel so alone then,Mentalcomposer
youve got this one step at a time and you and him will get there,Mentalcomposer
ok so nta for not wanting to take total responsibility for your brother,Mentalcomposer
your parents tho total ahs they cannot just decide they are done being parents   that aside,Mentalcomposer
you dont say what mental capacity your bro has so,Mentalcomposer
you need to explain to your bro that you are not equipped to handle being his caretaker and he needs to find whatever is going to make his life the best he can make it  but its going to mean he has to work at it no one else can do it for him he is an adult now and a if a group home is the best place for him thats where he should be the idea is to get him as self sufficient as possible,Mentalcomposer
mom must have some contacts that she has used in the past contact them get bro evaluated to see exactly what his strengths and weaknesses are autism is a huge range but he at the very least will need mh therapy,Mentalcomposer
after that he may need some basic vocation training so he can get a basic job,Mentalcomposer
best of luck its not easy youll be overwhelmed at first but once all the pieces are in place you and your bro will be better off,Mentalcomposer
im so glad im not the  only one who found the idea of him peeing too  loud to be bizarre,Mentalcomposer
couldnt really care about any of the rest of it i was just stuck on that,Mentalcomposer
no not just anyone can go vote,Mentalcomposer
you have to register to vote,Mentalcomposer
then you get  or at least i did but it was lots of years ago a voter registration card in the mail,Mentalcomposer
depending on where you live you are assigned a specific place where you vote you can only vote at that place because you will be on their voter roll  the list of ppl registered to vote at that spot,Mentalcomposer
so when you go to vote you give them your name they look you up in a book you sign the book  and they are supposed to make sure your signature matches what you signed when you first registered and then you can vote,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
i need to know how old your brother is,Mentalcomposer
so sit by your dad even if hes not conscious  idk his state and just talk say whatever comes to mind ramble,Mentalcomposer
he will hear you and youll have no regrets you will have told him everything you havent been able to say in the past,Mentalcomposer
hugs to you,Mentalcomposer
from your comment i think it matters what he did during this fight that made you feel you had to leave,Mentalcomposer
if you felt threatened its completely diff than if you were just done fighting he wouldnt stop and wanted to just get some space,Mentalcomposer
in any case hes just embarrassed and even if some of your friends have reached out he thinks others will hold this incident against him so you tell him he either comes on thursday or he doesnt but he cant be sad if you go seems he wants you to avoid these friends so he doesnt look like the bad guy,Mentalcomposer
also i feel pretty strongly that you need at least one friend you can vent your problems to thats what theyre for its ridiculous that you would never talk about him or your relationship with your friends,Mentalcomposer
we all do it and dont hold it over the partner its a way to get an objective opinion on whats going on,Mentalcomposer
very sorry for what youre going through,Mentalcomposer
i think the answer is very different for everyone,Mentalcomposer
it will depend on what you already know so for instance was your dad military and never talked about it do you want to know that,Mentalcomposer
did dad have a first wife and youre curious why is he fighting with,Mentalcomposer
or do you just want to hear that you turned out alright in your parents eyes are you doing ok do they like your partner or kids,Mentalcomposer
maybe you want to make amends over an issue,Mentalcomposer
figure out what it is that you need or want to know and have those conversations,Mentalcomposer
maybe your dad should tell your sister that,Mentalcomposer
not that i think it would do any good,Mentalcomposer
she knew it was wrong and thats why she never said anything to anyone even if she was having a reveal youd think shed have spoken to your mom about names even just in passing conversation,Mentalcomposer
look you need to have a talk with pam,Mentalcomposer
explain to her that you actually love this guy and even tho you married  im not even sure why for a lark a joke just for the trope of a vegas marriage that over the last year you guys realized you had more and are happy,Mentalcomposer
but let her know you arent going to divorce just because shes not happy you two are together,Mentalcomposer
ask why she is so upset is it because its her friend or did she want him or what because she seems to be upset for no actual reason something else is going on with her,Mentalcomposer
during peri i had bleeding that lasted weeks also,Mentalcomposer
that was pretty much my only symptom but it lasted years on and off,Mentalcomposer
my doc prescribed micronized  i think thats it progesterone it stopped it,Mentalcomposer
then normal periods for a while and when it didnt stop i was able to just call her and shed call in another rx,Mentalcomposer
maybe ask if that might work for you,Mentalcomposer
i think youre in the wrong subreddit,Mentalcomposer
but i found this and its from jan of this year so its up to date,Mentalcomposer
i am not familiar with the diff between a lpr and a green card but you may be,Mentalcomposer
also found this,Mentalcomposer
i dont want c to pony up one red cent,Mentalcomposer
this is harrys burden to bear she can have half of whatever he has and he can pay his own damn lawyers,Mentalcomposer
and he can fight for custody on his own if he gets full or half or visitation or none oh well he had those kids with her,Mentalcomposer
c doesnt have to worry about those kids being in the los it is practically guaranteed they are never going to be anywhere near taking the throne,Mentalcomposer
and if she wants to go and spill all his dirty little secrets so be it he deserves everything he gets,Mentalcomposer
is this her first year in school maybe she is really stressed just getting used to it,Mentalcomposer
how long are you together  maybe shes just over this relationship,Mentalcomposer
but the insults yeah id let her know she can think youre joke isnt funny but she cant insult you,Mentalcomposer
but by your own admission youre,Mentalcomposer
clingy she may have been ok with it in the past but as you both matured she might feel its too much youre both adults you should be ok without constant contact all day long,Mentalcomposer
talk to her tell her you feel shes pulling away or not being as receptive and would appreciate it if she just owned up to what shes thinking and feeling rather than you having to guess,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with your bf  even if this person likes you they did nothing odd or creepy to you so why does he care,Mentalcomposer
i would tell the person what bf did and that it wasnt you tho just to clear up the situation so this person doesnt go on thinking you like them,Mentalcomposer
go ahead and end this,Mentalcomposer
these games will never stop and your bf will never take accountability for anything he does,Mentalcomposer
mainly because my whole family is here,Mentalcomposer
parents are getting older my kids are here and i would never leave them,Mentalcomposer
i dont want to be hours and a flight away if there is an emergency,Mentalcomposer
plus my life here is good,Mentalcomposer
slight yta,Mentalcomposer
why is the bf not going to be in school if they would both be home all day then no i wouldnt let her,Mentalcomposer
i would have told her she can stay home on friday and have a nice 3 day weekend,Mentalcomposer
please be aware that just as adults need a mental health day so do kids,Mentalcomposer
my kids were always allowed to stay home just because because sometimes they just need a break especially by hs it can be mentally draining,Mentalcomposer
seriously its a month 30 measly days,Mentalcomposer
you are not in love you are not sexually satisfied and you dont want to wait so do what any one would,Mentalcomposer
break up and find someone whos not a virgin and date them,Mentalcomposer
amazing that at 30 yo you need to be told this,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter if one of you is home for him now  this marriage may not last thats the problem,Mentalcomposer
how old are you guys she seems immature,Mentalcomposer
your wife needs to figure out what it is she wants either her marriage or affirmation from others  because she cannot have both,Mentalcomposer
put a hold on the foster and have a heart to heart with your wife,Mentalcomposer
shes still talking to this guy which means shes getting something from him that she isnt fri you and thats not necessarily your fault no one can be absolutely everything for another person,Mentalcomposer
the last few cruises i went on they lined up the boarding group we had to put our bags on the floor and the sniffer dogs came by so be careful,Mentalcomposer
idk what vacuum sealing does but just saying,Mentalcomposer
and why does that not immediately scream that this guy is just looking for a wife anyone will do,Mentalcomposer
you are just way too naive to realize it,Mentalcomposer
hasnt he been in trouble previously,Mentalcomposer
how does he keep getting elected or how has no watchdog group been keeping a close eye on him,Mentalcomposer
i agree i hate the way it looks even tho i currently have this look haha,Mentalcomposer
i dont have very big roots showing but theyre there and i see it a lot more than anyone in my family notices,Mentalcomposer
brown to blonde isnt hard to upkeep but it has to be done very often and im due but i just got home from vacay so i scheduled it but its gonna be a few days,Mentalcomposer
also depending on what process i have the brown can be made to almost blend into the blonde so its not all flat blonde but highlighted blonde with still some brown so it isnt as obvious,Mentalcomposer
youre only 25 theres no shame in living at home if not now then when in your life would you ever be able to save as much as you can youre lucky that your salary affords you a chance to get yourself financially ahead why spend money unnecessarily,Mentalcomposer
your gf cares more about what your,Mentalcomposer
money can do for her,Mentalcomposer
she has said you two should have a lavish lifestyle and travel but the thing is she cant afford to do that only you can afford to finance her lavish lifestyle,Mentalcomposer
id break up with her honestly but you need to think about if you want a partner who has goals closer to your own and she doesnt she thinks youre boring unless you can lavish luxuries on her and its only going to get worse as you make more money shell want bigger and better,Mentalcomposer
by your own chart it takes 95000 just to start up a daycare  less if the contingency and working capital is lower,Mentalcomposer
so lets say you magically find a benefactor for that money,Mentalcomposer
im not sure i understand how youre going to lower the cost even if its not for profit it needs to self sustain at some point,Mentalcomposer
being transparent in how the money is spent is all well and good but it doesnt make up for the fact that running a business takes money,Mentalcomposer
you could run the tightest budget but there is an absolute bottom line needed to run,Mentalcomposer
teacher costs need to be in line with teacher salaries especially that pre school is in a sense a specialty,Mentalcomposer
i proposed the admin being paid at the same rate of a teacher so no excess bloat there,Mentalcomposer
and at a modest 45000 year for each of those positions were at 9000year per child,Mentalcomposer
ok so we take a loss for a year or two  weve only got about 40000 contingency and capital how long will that last,Mentalcomposer
we add in older kids for a smaller ratio and increased income thats another teacher but we have to get them to the center after school do we need a van or a bus,Mentalcomposer
maybe we add night or weekend baby sitting service for a small fee we still have to pay an adult for that,Mentalcomposer
we can ask for volunteers older folks who are retired or moms that have their kids enrolled they dont add to the payroll but they need to be bonded,Mentalcomposer
maybe you dont have your own building maybe utilize empty classrooms in a school or community center of the town,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i feel like im missing something but am very intrigued to see a way for your idea to work,Mentalcomposer
so i think your idea sounds great in theory,Mentalcomposer
but a quick search brought me to the,Mentalcomposer
staff child ratio for kids 2 124 is 1t for every 10 ks,Mentalcomposer
so lets assume a teacher salary of 45000year  conservatively,Mentalcomposer
that divides to 4500year per child just to pay for a teacher,Mentalcomposer
add to that  at least one administratorrent insurance supplies and idk what else,Mentalcomposer
lets say we pay the admin the same as the teacher so were looking at 9000 per child before factoring in any other expenses,Mentalcomposer
the average cost of daycare in nj is between 1012000 a year,Mentalcomposer
so based on these numbers i cant see how you can run a childcare center for less than most parents are paying now,Mentalcomposer
and even if you dont take a salary to start at some point youre going to want or need to draw a salary,Mentalcomposer
now i dont know if the state has any programs that help with daycare costs if so then maybe its doable,Mentalcomposer
you might be better off getting a home based daycare license and having less children while also incorporating a learning atmosphere,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
maybe your friend is the boring one and he needs drunk you to make his party a success,Mentalcomposer
or youre just really fun at parties drunk or not and he just thinks youre drunk because you are such fun and hes too drunk to tell the difference,Mentalcomposer
i would be slightly insulted by someone saying that so go to the party have a few but dont get drunk and be your fun self,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
you havent actually explained why you dont want your h to take this job has it occurred to you that he has been out of sorts for 3 years and maybe your h feels like he needs to work a lot of people get their self worth from working and contributing to the family plus you mention insurance which if you dont have is kind of important,Mentalcomposer
how is his health now can he even handle this job,Mentalcomposer
why exactly do you not want him working is it his health or do you need him home with the child so you can grow your business or do you just not want him gone for 2 weeks at a time because then you have to do it all,Mentalcomposer
does your business cover all of your bills or are you dipping into savings every month its always better to have more savings than less,Mentalcomposer
you need to find out why he wants this job at this time if he has legitimate reasons then maybe you should try to support him in this if you need to you can put your child in daycare while you work on your business,Mentalcomposer
will it be hard while hes gone absolutely but supporting our partners is part of the deal he supported  i dont mean just monetarily you when you wanted to start your business,Mentalcomposer
ok i have to ask what exactly is he doing for work,Mentalcomposer
hes in an awful rush for someone,Mentalcomposer
who is a spender why is he in such a rush its been 6 years he can wait another 2  youre both still so young,Mentalcomposer
you say you have money saved for a house down payment i cant help but wonder if he sees you as his cash cow has he saved any money since he dropped out of school,Mentalcomposer
sit down and reiterate to him that you have always said you will not be married until you have completed your schooling and have a stable job,Mentalcomposer
let him know this is what you want and him constantly bothering you when you are still in school is useless because even if you wanted to marry right now you wouldnt,Mentalcomposer
im sure hes a great guy but think long and hard if you who from all youve said sets a goal and works towards them and achieves them while he seems more like flitting from one to another thing based on his whims,Mentalcomposer
you need to see how comparable you two are when youre both out in the real world rent bills chores etc you may find you want a guy who is more on your wavelength,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
who believes that youre a fool if you learn from your own mistakes,Mentalcomposer
isnt that the point make mistake learn from it dont do it again,Mentalcomposer
does she keep making the same mistake over and over again,Mentalcomposer
in this case her saying she knows shes right and youll continue it at another time just means she will harp on this until you agree with her and she can then gloat about it,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
how has this conversation not come up in 3 years,Mentalcomposer
stop brow beating the poor kid,Mentalcomposer
his mother has told you how she feels maybe you should try listening to her it is quite possible that you arent as all knowing as you think you are,Mentalcomposer
i will say tho one way to get kids in the habit of please and thank you is to just always say it yourself,Mentalcomposer
they hear it and model it it almost becomes rote to say it  kind of like amen at church thats my experience anyway,Mentalcomposer
its 3 months youre not officially bfgf and hes asking telling strongly encouraging you to get rid of something youve had from your childhood  nope not happening,Mentalcomposer
adults are allowed to have comfort things him saying hes there to comfort you is weird to me like only he can do that for you,Mentalcomposer
you keep that bear forever and take him out when you need to,Mentalcomposer
you got this,Mentalcomposer
now hope hes a good kisser,Mentalcomposer
okay i can better see why you wouldnt want her there but she really wont be able to outshine you at your own wedding as long as she doesnt get the dance which is easily done,Mentalcomposer
what else could she do you let the photographer know to put her in her place you get the band to ignore her requests and you warn her shell be tossed if she gets out of hand,Mentalcomposer
if you might want things to get better then ask sis if shes be willing to go to therapy with you,Mentalcomposer
maybe an outside person explaining to her why her attitude is harmful to you may just make her take a back seat at your wedding,Mentalcomposer
or just dont invite her but that plays into her idea that you know shes better than you and thats why you dont want her there,Mentalcomposer
good luck dont stress too much you have a year to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
how about at the end of the night when he drops you off at home you can just flirtingly say something like  what no good night kiss,Mentalcomposer
it will only be a teeny tiny moment of fear but i guarantee you he will kiss you good night,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
im struggling to understand what is wrong between you and your sister,Mentalcomposer
i understand sm being nicer to sis but thats not her doing anything wrong she was a child at the time too so i can understand you not having anything to do with dad and sm but you got along well enough with sis to be a bridesmaid for her,Mentalcomposer
just so i understand tho you dont want her there because you think shes going to somehow have a fd dance with step dad at your wedding,Mentalcomposer
easily fixed you tell the band they cannot under any circumstances take song requests and you also let sd know what shes thinking and ask him to not dance with sis at all if he understands the whole dynamic and realizes the place he has in your life he should be willing to do that,Mentalcomposer
thats what i was talking about,Mentalcomposer
put that on your tik tok your insta anywhere you use social media,Mentalcomposer
and ill add the florida law has a rape exception also,Mentalcomposer
but it has to reported,Mentalcomposer
you may be toxic but that comment was not,Mentalcomposer
how about compiling a list of birth control resources,Mentalcomposer
put it on tik tok instagram twitter,Mentalcomposer
places younger  women might frequent,Mentalcomposer
and fb for the older women,Mentalcomposer
take a diff approach and try to prevent an unwanted pregnancy instead of having to deal with it after the fact,Mentalcomposer
and have a connection resources that connects women willing to fund bc for women who cant afford it,Mentalcomposer
well the easy hard answer is to find a job in london and move there,Mentalcomposer
you have a roommate now so get one there,Mentalcomposer
or find a job in london and live in a suburb close enough to enjoy the city but less expensive,Mentalcomposer
what kind of engineer are you,Mentalcomposer
this is what i always thought also,Mentalcomposer
just let me get up and walk off then the rest can deal with getting their bags,Mentalcomposer
and while were revamping debark can we just board the plane by rows starting at the back please  ill even let first or business board before me theyre not the problem,Mentalcomposer
find a boy scout troop in your area,Mentalcomposer
they would be happy to have it,Mentalcomposer
they do lots of camping and might have kids that dont own gear,Mentalcomposer
elementary schools have cub scout troops but boy scout troops usually arent run through a school but if you,Mentalcomposer
can get in touch with a cub troop they can put you in touch with a boy scout troop that they usually feed into,Mentalcomposer
tomatoes,Mentalcomposer
i could not stand the texture of the seeds,Mentalcomposer
even now i wont eat the seeds in the big tomatoes i cut them out but can handle the small cherry tomatoes,Mentalcomposer
i love the way he says itll never happen with you two because you arent going to have kids as if thats where he draws a line pretty convenient for a guy who doesnt want kids,Mentalcomposer
but what happens if he for whatever reason decides hes not sexually attractive to you,Mentalcomposer
or what if you get sick and cant have sex for a while  is it ok then for him to cheat because you know he just cant go without,Mentalcomposer
i feel like you are going to be doing anything you can to keep him from cheating probably to your own detriment and it wont make a diff anyway,Mentalcomposer
im thinking hes already cheating when youre not there he cant possibly be expected to go without his sex needs being met for a whole month  gasp,Mentalcomposer
if i was you id slow this relationship way down if he wants to move to canada ok but hed be getting his own place,Mentalcomposer
but im not you so id get rid of this guy i want my partner to go into a relationship with the absolute idea that he has found the person he wants to be with and not having pre conceived ideas of circumstances of when hed cheat,Mentalcomposer
11 hours non stop to hawaii in economy this was the smallest seat ive ever been in,Mentalcomposer
i dropped my ear bud right in front of my seat and had to contort my body to reach for it,Mentalcomposer
im not a large person either,Mentalcomposer
made it 7 hours ok but the last 4 were really really tough,Mentalcomposer
and then had to do it again to get home,Mentalcomposer
the whole family agrees that well never do that again,Mentalcomposer
im not in texas but im not so sure there are specific parking lot laws,Mentalcomposer
drive slowly thru the lot i think my shopping center has a 10 mph speed sign,Mentalcomposer
yes please stop for pedestrians crossing in front of your car the lane directly in front of the stores near me have stop signs usually close to each of the stores entrances exits,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to stop as soon as you see a person but it really depends on how far away they are from you if theyre like 2 stores away you slow down and  or stop until they cross,Mentalcomposer
id wait until the person was pretty close to the other side of the road before scooching past especially if theyre older or have children with them just so they feel safer,Mentalcomposer
better to be safer and drive slow or stop if youre not sure,Mentalcomposer
nta i would not apologize for any of it substance or tone,Mentalcomposer
your tone needed to be what it was to get the message across that he is no longer welcome to stay too bad if it upset him,Mentalcomposer
you basically said what your mother has been unable to do on her own,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get out your mom said she needs a break from him so now she has it,Mentalcomposer
wouldnt the line be drawn by what are natural genetic advantages to a person,Mentalcomposer
if one is just as is said naturally gifted in a sport should they be not allowed to participate because its not fair to the other participants,Mentalcomposer
their genetic make up is basically what is making them what we would call naturally gifted,Mentalcomposer
but with trans women athletes they have an unnatural advantage over women due to their genetic make up as being born as men,Mentalcomposer
hormones may counteract some of this but it is never going to completely reverse the effects of the genetic processes of male puberty on things like strength and muscle mass,Mentalcomposer
are we talking during a marriage or a dating situation,Mentalcomposer
why would you think that just because one person cheated you will never find another who wont cheat,Mentalcomposer
if the cheating happened during a marriage i would say take some time for yourself dont be in any rush to get into another relationship treat it like a death you need time to grieve the loss and when you feel ready then you can get back out there,Mentalcomposer
if you were just dating this shouldnt be causing you so much angst that youd be averse to ever dating again,Mentalcomposer
this was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time,Mentalcomposer
millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on it happens we deal with it and get on with living its not the end of the world,Mentalcomposer
why are you letting him insult you,Mentalcomposer
this is a person who loves you id hate to see him when he doesnt like you,Mentalcomposer
i suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with,Mentalcomposer
you know this but you are doing just fine you can pay your bills support your kid and really can buy whatever you want if not right this minute but with some planning,Mentalcomposer
stop giving him money and do not move in with him ever you will be stuck paying for it by yourself,Mentalcomposer
after 7 years youre finally getting tired of this,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt have lasted 7 days,Mentalcomposer
be honest with yourself here he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior,Mentalcomposer
so you either put up with it or you break up hes way too insecure to have any middle ground,Mentalcomposer
first off dont change anything fundamentally you for anyone,Mentalcomposer
second you said youre studying for med school so use all this extra free time to do just that but get out at least for a bit every day take a walk study in a park coffee shop anywhere else than where you live,Mentalcomposer
third youre young but not a child you started dating as a kid tho idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so bad that he doesnt want to date anymore but it does not matter this breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way there will be others you will date and break up with use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner,Mentalcomposer
fourth get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side if you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand,Mentalcomposer
fifth stop studying so much,Mentalcomposer
there is a point where it doesnt actually help studying is for review not for learning the material,Mentalcomposer
this all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with,Mentalcomposer
yup me too,Mentalcomposer
they wanted to make it look like she was,Mentalcomposer
and harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way,Mentalcomposer
then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have,Mentalcomposer
plus your d was away and its a perfect time for some mom son bonding time,Mentalcomposer
your son is 13 hes going into some crazy years your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to ty about whats going on in his life and if that includes james even better,Mentalcomposer
they do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up,Mentalcomposer
i think theres no reason you should have known who was picking up ty since im guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs,Mentalcomposer
but if your wife is home why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month,Mentalcomposer
since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son i think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks  weeks,Mentalcomposer
i think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell ty together  honestly i think a good talk about what he says and where its said should be enough what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff but whatever,Mentalcomposer
but i also think you and wife should discuss that shes going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens and im not talking punishments im talking correcting bad behavior when its not even so bad so that it doesnt get bad,Mentalcomposer
this isnt 1950 where its wait until your father gets home,Mentalcomposer
because people now feel like every day has to be a good one a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times,Mentalcomposer
their lives have to be picture perfect their partner the perfect one the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing its all so superficial,Mentalcomposer
that is not reality a lot of long relationships are quite mundane but nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment but the mundane makes the special that much more,Mentalcomposer
add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car,Mentalcomposer
so people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying,Mentalcomposer
married 30 years since our 20s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows we just take what comes and deal with it,Mentalcomposer
you sit back and take stock of whats going on in your own life,Mentalcomposer
then you decide am i going to let my life be dictated by others or am i going to take matters in my own hands,Mentalcomposer
leave the emotion out of it no issue is ever solved by the heart you need to use your head,Mentalcomposer
in this instance you get mad,Mentalcomposer
id be thinking,Mentalcomposer
who the heck does this person think they are to treat me badly when ive done nothing to deserve it,Mentalcomposer
hes obviously up to no good im not gonna sit here and take it  im out he can do whatever he wants but im not sticking around and watching,Mentalcomposer
and then you say that loud and firm this isnt a discussion its a decision,Mentalcomposer
its your decision,Mentalcomposer
ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is,Mentalcomposer
do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way,Mentalcomposer
do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants,Mentalcomposer
why are you still entertaining being involved with him,Mentalcomposer
this is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion im gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to,Mentalcomposer
that in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that id cut contact with him he sees you as less than and you have allowed yourself to believe it,Mentalcomposer
tell him to take a hike find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect,Mentalcomposer
have you ever met this guy,Mentalcomposer
and by that i mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move,Mentalcomposer
you find std meds and you didnt ask what he was taking it for,Mentalcomposer
did he willingly tell you he was going for an std test  and you didnt ask him why he felt the need to,Mentalcomposer
and hes checking himself all night and again you didnt ask what he was looking for,Mentalcomposer
do you two even talk to each other,Mentalcomposer
yeah you know whats going on you guys have been together since youre teens its run its course,Mentalcomposer
ill be honest i would not continue dating him drugs are a hard no for me,Mentalcomposer
you say youre ok with coke at a party but really its never going to stay at just parties and hes already tried heroin after 2 months,Mentalcomposer
im more curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit did he just wake up one day and say hey think ill use coke today and see how it goes,Mentalcomposer
if hes addicted its really really hard to break the addiction he will relapse,Mentalcomposer
he will lie,Mentalcomposer
are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life the highs when hes clean and the very low lows when he relapses the in and out of rehab,Mentalcomposer
id tell him he has to do this on his own for himself when hes clean and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what,Mentalcomposer
you want to do,Mentalcomposer
good luck its hard to see someone you love struggle but its his struggle dont make it yours,Mentalcomposer
so the story i just read his lawyer argued he was mentally ill,Mentalcomposer
no mention of being autistic so that had no bearing on why he killed,Mentalcomposer
sorry i agree with the judge he should never see another day free,Mentalcomposer
he was 20 so even though technically a minor whatever law you mentioned shouldnt apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult,Mentalcomposer
whats to question,Mentalcomposer
youre a boy you are were attracted to this person who presents as a girl therefore you are straight,Mentalcomposer
now this person says theyre a boy but they still look like a girl so youre still attracted and still straight,Mentalcomposer
does this persons family know they think theyre a boy,Mentalcomposer
did you ask them if they think theyre a boy are they gay then since they presumably like you and youre also a boy,Mentalcomposer
still not going anywhere romantically just be friends,Mentalcomposer
ok i have to ask,Mentalcomposer
are you straight and thought you were dating a girl,Mentalcomposer
or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy,Mentalcomposer
if youre straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys,Mentalcomposer
if youre gay then you can date this person because they think theyre a boy  except for the fact that they look like a girl and you arent attracted to girls,Mentalcomposer
this is going nowhere romantically,Mentalcomposer
just be friends since you seem to get along so well then it wont matter if theyre a boy or girl,Mentalcomposer
how old are you two,Mentalcomposer
how is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough,Mentalcomposer
what did the two of you change,Mentalcomposer
has rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant otherwise its going to be a very awkward dinner,Mentalcomposer
but i think youre trying to do the right thing its up to rose to realize its what her d wants,Mentalcomposer
sorry but she knows the real reason she doesnt want to have sex and its not stress or low self esteem,Mentalcomposer
she would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years  and really a lot of people will use sex to combat stress,Mentalcomposer
if she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years then shes got  therapist level issues that she needs to address,Mentalcomposer
you two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this,Mentalcomposer
ill bet shes probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you because shed be afraid of losing you,Mentalcomposer
but you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty especially on this subject,Mentalcomposer
maybe just stop lying,Mentalcomposer
have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself,Mentalcomposer
if they turn out to be bad so be it but at least you did it and learned from it,Mentalcomposer
and idk how your schools work but if you dont know history or geography how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate there has to be some minimum grade you have to get and if there is and youre making it just tell him that too,Mentalcomposer
your bmr might be off if youre using the same number from when you were 250 lbs,Mentalcomposer
recalculate it,Mentalcomposer
you do realize that your sole job is not to make him happy,Mentalcomposer
of course in a relationship each person makes the other happy but not from doing every whim the other has,Mentalcomposer
also you are your bfs first gf from what you wrote he didnt seem to have friends either and didnt leave the house much,Mentalcomposer
he didnt have the usual date around as a teen figure out all the dating rituals etc,Mentalcomposer
idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship,Mentalcomposer
that might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around and sleeping around plus most first relationships do not work out long term  but those are usually had as a teen which he didnt,Mentalcomposer
his idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you hell get to sleep with others,Mentalcomposer
and having 2 permanent gfs might be way of dating around hell have to navigate more than just one personality,Mentalcomposer
im probably reading too much into it  but thats the first thought that came to mind,Mentalcomposer
i agree its sad almost,Mentalcomposer
i buzz my ha hair and i told him when he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it,Mentalcomposer
but i would not just not say anything,Mentalcomposer
but who knows maybe hs happy with it,Mentalcomposer
while i absolutely agree it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan i suspect there was a lot more going on,Mentalcomposer
op says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so i suspect dad gave in to the car if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him,Mentalcomposer
and lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also its not just dad,Mentalcomposer
he put money away for college and cars its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college,Mentalcomposer
some kids are spenders and some are savers and no matter how much talking showing and giving advice they will not change until they are faces with the consequences,Mentalcomposer
son can still go to college he just doesnt have the option of any college he got admitted to his list shrinks due to money issues,Mentalcomposer
remember too that d is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford and the actual cost out of her savings,Mentalcomposer
yta massive,Mentalcomposer
come on dad as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife double that for your son,Mentalcomposer
he is losing his mother  the one person who has always always been there for him,Mentalcomposer
so instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up you get mad because he didnt clean his room,Mentalcomposer
really how important is his room right this minute,Mentalcomposer
give him a break,Mentalcomposer
and im sorry but i dont understand the significance of the hair if someone could explain please,Mentalcomposer
the minute he told you to delete a friend for any reason is the exact minute you should have broken up with him,Mentalcomposer
when are young people going to understand this  its irrational its jealousy and its controlling,Mentalcomposer
i say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man,Mentalcomposer
maybe ask your bf why if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there,Mentalcomposer
is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf was sb good to him at a time in bfs life when he needed someone was sb a mentor for bf something anything,Mentalcomposer
then i would take that into consideration also,Mentalcomposer
it just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isnt really seeing that and i wonder why,Mentalcomposer
bring back the hat and rename back to hollywood studios,Mentalcomposer
we still call it that anyway,Mentalcomposer
weve been going since 94 and dont even remember that hand sign i had to look it up to see what it looked like i dont like it,Mentalcomposer
then youre going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work,Mentalcomposer
maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now if she loses her job or quits will you be able to afford it  dont wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it,Mentalcomposer
at this point just swap rooms with her she can set up her school stuff in the br,Mentalcomposer
this way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can and if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also,Mentalcomposer
it seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day you wont be dealing with this every day,Mentalcomposer
her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her,Mentalcomposer
then shes all set,Mentalcomposer
honestly i would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed but only if i have already explained what the vibe of these parties are did you explain this to her if you did and she still made no effort that would be a big problem,Mentalcomposer
you didnt pressure him into not telling his family but you also only told him when you were 5 months along,Mentalcomposer
im sure he knew how could he not but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was im guessing all excited but you didnt share it with him did you share this news with anyone,Mentalcomposer
he didnt get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho what family traditions of his does he not agree with,Mentalcomposer
my dermo told me to just moisturize them like thats gonna help,Mentalcomposer
i remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for age spots i think it fades them,Mentalcomposer
im thinking of looking for something like that but i cannot remember that exact name tho,Mentalcomposer
i had to go back to make sure but,Mentalcomposer
you are 16  you have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person,Mentalcomposer
are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever  its not going to happen teen romances very rarely last,Mentalcomposer
your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff so ask out any girl who seems to be nice cute or have a same interest as you,Mentalcomposer
and stop worrying so much desperation is not attractive at all,Mentalcomposer
you dont think youre attracted to her so give it one more date,Mentalcomposer
dont discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company,Mentalcomposer
heres how i look at it as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any of these people especially if they dont even live anywhere near us i dont have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
there are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live that i really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen,Mentalcomposer
its basically harmless,Mentalcomposer
but thats just my personal feeling,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper or had any form of sm knows about it and talked about it,Mentalcomposer
we heard all about it talked about it speculated about it waited for all the details to finally come out and,Mentalcomposer
we got a list of people who flew in a plane,Mentalcomposer
virginia guiffree got her payday andrew is relegated to scum of the world je is dead and ghislaine is in jail,Mentalcomposer
what more is there to say,Mentalcomposer
no one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else  im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents,Mentalcomposer
sometimes relationships just run its course she was 17 when you started andnow shes an adult,Mentalcomposer
she wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched,Mentalcomposer
i think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home that alone would make me lose any feelings for this person,Mentalcomposer
so dont concentrate on what you lost concentrate on the fact that she didnt even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship and needing some time to decide if she still wants it,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt want you shell go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isnt greener dont be that guy block her on everything youre worth more than that,Mentalcomposer
wait,Mentalcomposer
the dad didnt want one,Mentalcomposer
what did the wife want,Mentalcomposer
cause the fact that her best friend wanted one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me,Mentalcomposer
maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path,Mentalcomposer
even if hes depressed he seems to be able to do the farm work he just starts much later than most farmers,Mentalcomposer
but if he got to sleep at a decent time he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus,Mentalcomposer
talk to him and his parents,Mentalcomposer
im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change and if theyre so overbearing i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand,Mentalcomposer
i dont think youre too involved you care about his family and only want whats best doe them,Mentalcomposer
i think youre trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done no,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case just waking him up isnt really going to help unless he stays up and does the work who is working his farm,Mentalcomposer
i think you need to have a serious talk with him,Mentalcomposer
if you guys were so close what happened when did fam dinners stop when did you stop working for him,Mentalcomposer
you said the behavior changed a year ago so what was it like prior to that,Mentalcomposer
and where are the kids mother does she not see them at all does she also just let them do whatever,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get his kids on a better schedule his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night what is he thinking by allowing this and his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting,Mentalcomposer
talk to him explain your concerns if you are as close as you say he might open up and explain whats going on with him,Mentalcomposer
is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm  do his parents not see what is going on,Mentalcomposer
why do you want to get past this,Mentalcomposer
hes been doing this stuff for 6 years what makes you think hes going to stop,Mentalcomposer
see heres the thing as i see it,Mentalcomposer
yes she cheated and that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce,Mentalcomposer
but you have to also realize that you werent a model partner to her either  you lost your job over drinking and im gonna assume when you drank you werent exactly a great husband to her,Mentalcomposer
now i am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am i excusing her cheating,Mentalcomposer
im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up at this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive forget or get over,Mentalcomposer
get some help for the drinking its no way to live and her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him thats not your problem any more,Mentalcomposer
thank you,Mentalcomposer
now i understand what ppl mean when they say it,Mentalcomposer
can i ask what they nickel and dime you for,Mentalcomposer
i hear the words im reading in my head but i actually read too fast and find i dont retain what i read sometimes,Mentalcomposer
so i have to purposely make myself read slower and if i dont understand what i read i read it very slowly out loud pausing to make sure im getting it,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho have you tried to purposely read faster what happens do you retain the info,Mentalcomposer
i love that you know that much history of your family,Mentalcomposer
have you been back to hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there,Mentalcomposer
those pics are so classic 50s america,Mentalcomposer
i dont necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped they have to be shipped somehow but id like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen,Mentalcomposer
an approved maybe regulated plan from outside the company preferably,Mentalcomposer
good job on the script that way nothing gets taken out of context and you say all that needs to be said,Mentalcomposer
and i never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes just saying its not the best in the long run for his problem,Mentalcomposer
ah big ones,Mentalcomposer
i searched quick but didnt find anything helpful,Mentalcomposer
so id say go to the er but id tell them they passed out the same day that way its an emergency and they have to treat,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i hope your relative will be ok,Mentalcomposer
while i agree you cannot make him go and get help i would have one more conversation about it,Mentalcomposer
frame it as this we have a child we need to make sure we are at our best for them if you wont get help for yourself at least do it for our child its not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day and its not healthy to self medicate with marijuana ive got nothing against it it just ultimately isnt going to solve his problem its just pushing it down the road,Mentalcomposer
tell him youll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes  id ask friends neighborsanyone for a recommendation and id call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him,Mentalcomposer
what kind of work up did the dr recommend,Mentalcomposer
i dont know about the er but id be surprised if they would do a work up there im assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs,Mentalcomposer
i found this tho,Mentalcomposer
specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen,Mentalcomposer
it seems they are free and will do a check up which usually involves lab work idk how the lab work would be billed tho maybe give them a call and ask explain what happened and what the dr said,Mentalcomposer
we need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to sign over the car,Mentalcomposer
depending on why the no contact im not so sure id sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie mae loan,Mentalcomposer
are you sure hes paying off his car you might get stuck with that too,Mentalcomposer
but i also agree i would never ever sign a blank document if youre going to sign it over id make sure to fill it out first you should know all then i do its asking for and take and keep a copy of the filled out form,Mentalcomposer
this is what i did and i am absolutely no expert by any stretch but this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started,Mentalcomposer
go here,Mentalcomposer
this will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight,Mentalcomposer
then subtract 25 of that amount and aim to eat that each day,Mentalcomposer
get a food scale to weigh everything,Mentalcomposer
then i just planned out what to eat for bl and dinner for the next 2 or 3 days i went shopping so i had everything i needed to stick with it,Mentalcomposer
i very rarely eat breakfast just coffee but i almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato olives carrot cucumber and a protein the protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna  in water i did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns,Mentalcomposer
dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken fish or beef and vegetables and a small salad lots of vegs,Mentalcomposer
and water was the only thing i drank lots and lots of water,Mentalcomposer
snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots,Mentalcomposer
have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack  or if you just wanted something,Mentalcomposer
it seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly,Mentalcomposer
but weigh everything  i even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my salad a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but i still counted it,Mentalcomposer
you can do this just dont try to be so militant crazy to start because you wont stick with it its ok to be over your calories when you start but you want to be over by 50 not 500,Mentalcomposer
i would cruise alone but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship,Mentalcomposer
go meet other solos these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt trust rooming with a random stranger,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused about justin,Mentalcomposer
hes not the babys dad we know that,Mentalcomposer
you met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be dad and you allowed that,Mentalcomposer
then you break up and he still wants to be dad even going as far as wanting to help with daycare,Mentalcomposer
have you even met this person have you ever lived in the same place,Mentalcomposer
all of this seems really really odd,Mentalcomposer
you broke up he wasnt in your life or your sons for all that long as a dad figure so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son,Mentalcomposer
now brian on the other hand do you,Mentalcomposer
know for a fact that he is the father,Mentalcomposer
because honestly it might be better for your son if hes not  the in out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough he doesnt support the child and you seem to be doing ok without him,Mentalcomposer
and now greg i would have him tested to see if hes actually your sons dad,Mentalcomposer
even if you dont want any support from him and even if he doesnt want anything to do with his child its better for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question,Mentalcomposer
if he is then you can cut brian out all together because really who needs the problems he comes with hes out of state has 2 other kids is in and out on a whim and doesnt pay any support,Mentalcomposer
in short,Mentalcomposer
find out who the father actually is then decide if you want to go for support and visitation,Mentalcomposer
dont have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son,Mentalcomposer
live your life raise your son and dont be so quick to want to have a daddy for him,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
show some respect for your grandfather and your grandmother,Mentalcomposer
is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about at this time,Mentalcomposer
everyones stressed on edge and its going to become about more than what it actually is,Mentalcomposer
this is not the time or place for you to make this about you your clothing choices over the years or what your family thinks about your choices,Mentalcomposer
either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them,Mentalcomposer
why are you even entertaining anything she says,Mentalcomposer
after telling her youre done this is not working for you anymore wish her well and hang up,Mentalcomposer
block her everywhere and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
she lives 4 hrs away from you its not like shes gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable,Mentalcomposer
its not really that hard,Mentalcomposer
this has been my fear forever,Mentalcomposer
also not just being uncovered but i could never even have my feet hang off the bed,Mentalcomposer
i do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers not even a sheet nope i need an actual comforter even in the summer,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
this is a lovely thing to do with your nieces,Mentalcomposer
and especially since its the younger ones first time it should be just the 4 of you,Mentalcomposer
this is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it,Mentalcomposer
im sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids they dont have to infringe on your day,Mentalcomposer
ok so wait im confused,Mentalcomposer
the general tip box welfare thing what exactly is this,Mentalcomposer
are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew,Mentalcomposer
ive read its room steward and the other positions that guests dont see like cooks laundry etc workers who dont normally interact with guests,Mentalcomposer
i always pay mine and give the steward extra but id like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut,Mentalcomposer
so if we dont pay it the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount  which they should anyway instead of being supplemented by guests,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case im taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel  to those people and of course tip the steward his cut plus my extra,Mentalcomposer
am i understanding this correctly,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
but he cannot always respond the way you want or need he doesnt know what you want him to do or what you need,Mentalcomposer
heres the thing tho,Mentalcomposer
youve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people not just him,Mentalcomposer
not to be mean but i would be very surprised if one of you if not both of you get to college and realize you dont want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day it could very well be you deciding theres someone else out there that youd like to get to know,Mentalcomposer
it happens and it should happen you both need to be free to grow and mature,Mentalcomposer
the summer before college is a weird time both of you are going to be anxious nervous about going away being on your own for the first time can you handle it will you find friends will you be able to keep up with classes etc,Mentalcomposer
so dont stress about hypothetical things when you have enough real things that will stress you out,Mentalcomposer
we went twice in one day and my h was that guy both times,Mentalcomposer
the rest of us loved it he was not amused,Mentalcomposer
nta for not giving a gift,Mentalcomposer
its costing you a lot to go and she did say its understandable so believe her,Mentalcomposer
before i say more tho what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food what exactly is everyone supposed to do during the party part of the wedding reception,Mentalcomposer
but theres a few things you say that come off as concerning,Mentalcomposer
why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later maybe they did it for tax purposes for religious reasons or just because they felt like it not your business,Mentalcomposer
your thought that she wont be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre they are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them,Mentalcomposer
not having alcohol at the wedding isnt odd at all really plenty of people make that choice,Mentalcomposer
im getting weird vibes as if youre taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow,Mentalcomposer
shes having her celebration before yours even tho youve been engaged longer she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable,Mentalcomposer
her wedding really has nothing to do with you your bf or anyone else,Mentalcomposer
you understandably said its costing you a lot to go and how its really stretching the budget but youve already got 2 weddings youre going to next year undoubtably your friends or fam and i can see how youd say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasnt really budgeted for but this is the family you are going to marry into so id stretch that budget go with a smile and dont burn bridges before youve even been accepted into the family,Mentalcomposer
and its not your place to fight your bfs family battles if hes always put last its up to him to fix it or not im still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho,Mentalcomposer
i think it comes from our education system,Mentalcomposer
most people graduate hs at 1718 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart,Mentalcomposer
so if youre married at 18 you have to be allowed to do all the adult things job mortgage kids etc,Mentalcomposer
and i agree with the other poster by 18 youve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not,Mentalcomposer
im going to assume youre still somewhat young,Mentalcomposer
ignoring him isnt the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up,Mentalcomposer
use your words you think he was joking but youre not sure so you ignore him for 15 min but then after that amount of time you what just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened,Mentalcomposer
then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place,Mentalcomposer
look if he says something and you arent sure if its an insult or a joke you have two ways to handle this,Mentalcomposer
might be a joke answer back with a joke  youre free to leave at any time theres the door and see what he says he probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping thats like the hundredth store weve been in etc,Mentalcomposer
you banter back and forth a few times and its over,Mentalcomposer
you think its insulting then you tell him  hey that hurt whats the problem and he explains the exact same thing as above hes just frustrated being in the mall,Mentalcomposer
learn now how to communicate it will save you tons of drama in the future,Mentalcomposer
think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the counter,Mentalcomposer
like literally sit down close your eyes and go back thru every single thing youve done,Mentalcomposer
check every outfit you wore every car you were in every couch you sat on every backpack or pocketbook you used,Mentalcomposer
were you studying at any time check in your books,Mentalcomposer
did you pack a carry on or travel bag check the outside pockets,Mentalcomposer
its only been 5 months why are you so desperate to keep this guy,Mentalcomposer
he treats you horribly and you keep going back for more,Mentalcomposer
block him everywhere stay single for a bit i think you need to feel better about yourself before you get involved with anyone,Mentalcomposer
check out ncl  i dont know anything about any other lines as i havent sailed them sorry,Mentalcomposer
they have a deal now that the second person flies free but all the sailings in oct are at least 9 days,Mentalcomposer
you can do a complete mock booking so youll see the total cost of the trip with the air included,Mentalcomposer
the least expensive cabin will be an inside,Mentalcomposer
i did a mock booking 9 day southampton but ending in lisbon,Mentalcomposer
inside cabin for 2 their free at sea promo  look it up if you dont know what that is with air round trip from chicago  picked a middle of the usa airport and transfers from airport to ship and ship back to airport,Mentalcomposer
total 379246,Mentalcomposer
do a lot of research understand what you are getting for that price look at the ship and decide if it has the amenities you would like,Mentalcomposer
booking air thru the cruise line means you get the cheapest flight they can get times might not be ideal i suggest paying for a 1 or 2 day deviation so youre in the uk early in case of flight delays,Mentalcomposer
check out costco travel also,Mentalcomposer
if you have a cc with miles see if you can use them for flights and then you can shop around for travel agent deals also  but if you book thru a 3 rd party travel agent just know that the cruise line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it,Mentalcomposer
i hope this helps,Mentalcomposer
i agree so much with this,Mentalcomposer
i dont like mexican food all that much but i have never even tried refried beans,Mentalcomposer
just the look of it never mind the smell makes me gag,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its pretty standard procedure which if hes a regular he would know,Mentalcomposer
anyway would it help if you mentioned it to the dr,Mentalcomposer
i would like to think the dr doesnt want him talking to his staff the way he did,Mentalcomposer
you dont say how long you are together,Mentalcomposer
in my opinion this is in no way cheating,Mentalcomposer
what happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness,Mentalcomposer
it happens whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt mean you dont find your bf attractive doesnt mean you dont like or love him,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt say a word to bf all that will do is start drama of you dont find me attractive you dont want to be with me you want him,Mentalcomposer
honestly its just not worth it,Mentalcomposer
are you bored that youre not fighting anymore cause this feels like youre looking for more things to fight about,Mentalcomposer
you guys are really young but if you are under the misguided idea that once you love someone you should never find any other person attractive youre going to find that is just not the case,Mentalcomposer
if you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive youre kidding yourself,Mentalcomposer
edit to add,Mentalcomposer
or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you didnt say anything even slightly upsetting,Mentalcomposer
the fact of the matter is that maddie is not your mothers d and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family,Mentalcomposer
maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru your dads family but they are not,Mentalcomposer
maddie is 17 she knows how this stuff works,Mentalcomposer
so you guys havent been together all that long,Mentalcomposer
is there any truth to him saying if it wasnt for the baby you wouldnt be together  or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him,Mentalcomposer
is his need to get rich now a new thing maybe hes stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family now with the baby on the way,Mentalcomposer
the thing is starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going when is he gonna have time to be a dad get to know his baby give you a break from work and parenthood,Mentalcomposer
your text was a bit rough but the basic message needed to be said,Mentalcomposer
you should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like,Mentalcomposer
be the bigger person and go talk to him get this settled or itll keep coming up again and again,Mentalcomposer
how long are you two together,Mentalcomposer
do they have a registry,Mentalcomposer
if i could afford it for sibs id go with something big car seat stroller high chair etc,Mentalcomposer
if i couldnt afford that or im a younger sib who doesnt work yet or still in school id get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies towels shampoo baby wash rubber ducky,Mentalcomposer
and diapers  theyll need lots of diapers,Mentalcomposer
but not newborn size go one or two sizes up everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick,Mentalcomposer
sorry this is gonna come off as slightly mean but what exactly are you bringing to the table,Mentalcomposer
you work when youre not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression you have no hobbies not that i think its a big deal but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring,Mentalcomposer
you dont like sex but are willing if the guy is successful enough frankly that is so gross because you seem to think its a transaction take me out buy me things and ill lay back and suffer while you do your thing,Mentalcomposer
yet youre looking for a guy who by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal,Mentalcomposer
ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you,Mentalcomposer
youre going about this all wrong,Mentalcomposer
relationships take time and you have to put in the time stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince one who melds into your life not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve,Mentalcomposer
build that lifestyle together,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
can i ask what you mean by you work when you get the motivation,Mentalcomposer
do you not work full time have your own business,Mentalcomposer
im not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes but ill give some ideas,Mentalcomposer
im assuming you have a washing machine,Mentalcomposer
you can try just adding regular laundry bleach to your wash,Mentalcomposer
for stains best thing ive found is oxyclean,Mentalcomposer
i wet the garment put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste let it be for a bit then launder it i add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent i use,Mentalcomposer
i have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean,Mentalcomposer
i try to get the oxy to dissolve add the garment leave overnight and then launder,Mentalcomposer
if you dont have a washing machine use your bathtub,Mentalcomposer
im very late to the party but with regards to him mentioning his age it may be that hes saying that if you have met he may not remember it,Mentalcomposer
i think based off your lor which he read this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you  was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student maybe he is just interested in your particular field maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field,Mentalcomposer
either way i think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study,Mentalcomposer
i had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work,Mentalcomposer
if you do end up meeting him can you update us please,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if shes your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years,Mentalcomposer
does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose,Mentalcomposer
shes literally being a bitch right now,Mentalcomposer
and the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you who the hell do these women think they are your pregnancy is none of their or anybody elses business,Mentalcomposer
they can all just fuck right off  i wouldnt even go and even better i wouldnt even tell her im not showing up,Mentalcomposer
what a wonderful thing to do,Mentalcomposer
im sure that boy was thrilled,Mentalcomposer
well done,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
has it occurred to your h that maybe his dad doesnt want to move,Mentalcomposer
its quite normal for fil to be sad and unhappy he just lost his lifelong spouse,Mentalcomposer
but it may be that being in their home brings him some amount of comfort,Mentalcomposer
it did for my mil and my stepdad,Mentalcomposer
your h and his dad just have to go through the grieving process it may take some time but they will get to where they are back to a new normal,Mentalcomposer
it takes time there is no rushing it,Mentalcomposer
your h doesnt want to hear it now but youre absolutely right his dad should not be making any major decisions this soon,Mentalcomposer
sorry but if mom has issues and the child who is still very young isnt in school and is spending 24 hrs with an unstable person then yes its much safer and better for the wellbeing of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs,Mentalcomposer
its not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself,Mentalcomposer
better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok,Mentalcomposer
if it is then great  everything goes back to the way it is,Mentalcomposer
but if its not then both mom and child get the help they need,Mentalcomposer
im not saying you should go but heres a thought,Mentalcomposer
you should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding what activities does he have to be there for if any,Mentalcomposer
have him ask the groom what the seating is like sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates youll meet the other plus ones who if youre not seated with your bf youll be with the other plus ones but youll have already met them,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine theres something wedding related every day for a week,Mentalcomposer
if theres a few days he needs to do wedding things then you visit your family if theres days hes free then you guys can explore the city together,Mentalcomposer
i only buy audiobooks for books that i have read,Mentalcomposer
i put them on when cleaning or driving or cooking or on a bluetooth when i shower,Mentalcomposer
its my background so i dont have to really listen so intently to get the story since i already know it if that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
if i listen to an audiobook that is new to me i wouldnt be able to do anything else because id have to pay attention to whats going on in the story,Mentalcomposer
if your d stayed home from may to dec did she even have any income that would require her to file income taxes,Mentalcomposer
call me crazy but if she didnt  pay any income tax because she didnt work and stayed home with her kid while also pregnant theres no way she can get a refund,Mentalcomposer
i think youre fine but id check to see what would happen if she also files and you both get audited what will you need to show to prove you and not her supported this child,Mentalcomposer
keep the refund you earned it,Mentalcomposer
i had read about this before so heres the answer,Mentalcomposer
i loved those blankets took one home with each child,Mentalcomposer
when you feel its the right time and the other person feels its the right time,Mentalcomposer
but please pay attention to what your kids think and say about this person,Mentalcomposer
if they have any apprehension at all about you pairing up or spending time with your partner take a step back and introduce very slowly,Mentalcomposer
in other words dont force your kids to accept this person it will never work in the long term,Mentalcomposer
trust me i know more about planning than i ever thought i would need to,Mentalcomposer
just some people find it off putting in the beginning until they realize how good it can be,Mentalcomposer
and youre right about dates when dating,Mentalcomposer
heres a thought it takes some planning but it might help,Mentalcomposer
pick a night youd be ok having sex when he comes home or even during the day let him know sex is on the table for early evening ill guess hed shower since thats his usual and while you finish getting dinner ready have him hang out in the kitchen with you or he cooks whoever does whatever,Mentalcomposer
he should since he knows whats coming be flirty and affectionate with you and since you need that romancing itll set the tone,Mentalcomposer
then by a decent hour you guys have your fun hes happy youre happy and then you can do your night routine and get to bed at a decent time to get enough sleep  and he can play his games while youre having a bath if he still want to play afterwards,Mentalcomposer
i get that planning sexy time seems idk weird strange but sometimes its just what needs to happen,Mentalcomposer
sorry but as someone who has a hard line at cheating he is totally justified in not wanting anything to do with you,Mentalcomposer
thats my one and done,Mentalcomposer
you lost this good one learn from that,Mentalcomposer
now figure out why you allow yourself to get so trashed when you go out he didnt get you smashed you allowed that to happen,Mentalcomposer
you met this guy for 1 month,Mentalcomposer
he went back home way across the planet,Mentalcomposer
did you really think hes going to want to be in an exclusive long distance texting relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
why would you even want that,Mentalcomposer
the smartest thing you did was cut him off for both of you now you can both find someone that you can have a real relationship with,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
not only a huge ah but youre insane to boot,Mentalcomposer
who the hell do you think you are asking your supposed friends to wake up early to practice hair and make up for your stupid wedding,Mentalcomposer
these are grown ass woman who i am sure know how to do their hair and make up,Mentalcomposer
they dont need to practice and they dont have to make any sacrifices for your wedding,Mentalcomposer
leave them alone or you wont have any friends,Mentalcomposer
no,Mentalcomposer
does hayley have any friends  it may be that she doesnt have anyone else to talk to vent to or ask advice of if not she needs to get out there and meet other woman or ideally other moms,Mentalcomposer
so she relies on the only people she knows,Mentalcomposer
does she even want to live in switzerland shes only been there less than a year no,Mentalcomposer
id maybe have a talk with her and explain that you and your mom cannot be the ones to solve her marriage problems,Mentalcomposer
its does no good to have the whole family involved in personal matters,Mentalcomposer
she needs to talk to her h about these things,Mentalcomposer
if she thinks its bad enough they can get some counseling be prepared with a counseling service because shell undoubtedly have no clue where to go,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt write her off just yet shes had a lot of changes in a short amount of time she might feel a bit like a fish out of water and shes floundering,Mentalcomposer
barely having arguments just isnt a good enough basis for moving so fast,Mentalcomposer
you barely know this woman it takes longer than 6 mo to really get to know someone  is her behavior in this instance a taste of whats to come  idk and neither do you,Mentalcomposer
add to that she made you cut out your best woman friend that alone tells me shes a lot more controlling than you are allowing yourself to admit,Mentalcomposer
look im just saying slow things down a lot,Mentalcomposer
you say you both came out of abusive and toxic relationships so i have to wonder if you would recognize a healthy one youre so used to a bad one those old familiar patterns may seem normal to you,Mentalcomposer
youve been together 6 mo and are already engaged,Mentalcomposer
she has a best male friend you have never met,Mentalcomposer
accused you of cheating after dinner and took a pic of your lips,Mentalcomposer
gave you the silent treatment and wont even look at you,Mentalcomposer
this isnt the happily ever after you think it is,Mentalcomposer
its going to take her a long time to undo whats been ingrained in her mindset for so long but good for her for getting help,Mentalcomposer
maybe you can ask the therapist if it would be ok for you to put some small decisions back on her but only if the therapist says its ok,Mentalcomposer
small ones like what other brand to buy have a code word or phrase when she calls and you can answer with something like  i trust you to make the decision there is no wrong choice so feel free to decide,Mentalcomposer
it validates her while also encouraging her to make these small decisions,Mentalcomposer
now of course youre not going to tell her if the brand or product or choice she made is wrong youre going to have to just go with it even if you dont like it thats a sure fire way to set her back,Mentalcomposer
she will see that she doesnt have to defer to you for everything and there are no adverse consequences to that,Mentalcomposer
the problem with hs mental health issues is that he hasnt actually had much legitimate help for it,Mentalcomposer
he went to a real therapist for a bit anybody know why he stopped,Mentalcomposer
but after that he went on a crusade of trying to heal himself through some very unconventional means,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt want to actually get better  he thinks hes perfectly healthy he has it all figured out,Mentalcomposer
didnt he say something like  paraphrasing here he wanted the whole fam to get therapy so they could understand that they are the problem they need to be made to see that they are the bad guys they treated his wife wrong they didnt protect them  whatever the f that means they drove them out of the fam they made it untenable for them to stay etc etc etc,Mentalcomposer
as if him and the witch werent culpable at all,Mentalcomposer
he is just so out of touch with reality,Mentalcomposer
she probably didnt remember any of it and her bf had to tell her how she acted,Mentalcomposer
shes mortified about her behavior and is probably avoiding having to talk to you especially after she read your text,Mentalcomposer
maybe give her another day or two and text her again just ask how shes doing and see if she answers you,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if the bf actually put her out,Mentalcomposer
i saw a woman win over 1 million on a wheel of fortune game in atlantic city,Mentalcomposer
she was seriously shocked she said she doesnt usually gamble had no idea what to do just hit max bet,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt hug when youre introduced just give a wave and say hi its not to meet you,Mentalcomposer
since you havent been around kids just think of them as small people,Mentalcomposer
you must have some idea what they like from their dad so ask about those,Mentalcomposer
and dont disparage anything they say you might not like snakes but the kid has a pet snake for example you dont say snakes are gross you say ive never been around a snake and you talk about feeding it and caring for it etc,Mentalcomposer
just be yourself dont be too quiet but dont take over the conversation either,Mentalcomposer
dont rush this is only step one slow and steady is the best way to go,Mentalcomposer
hawaii,Mentalcomposer
never had a huge interest in going but we did and it was beautiful,Mentalcomposer
lots to see and do or you can just enjoy the beach,Mentalcomposer
its also kind of expensive so a honeymoon splurge is justified,Mentalcomposer
were retired,Mentalcomposer
its only that organized out of necessity really,Mentalcomposer
a couple years ago they went off in the middle of the night of course no fire but we couldnt get them to stop so had to get the fire dept out,Mentalcomposer
after that my h started putting the install dates on them and this last episode we figured since the batteries were being changed might as well date them too,Mentalcomposer
and theyre only hard wired cause we had an addition put on years ago and had to bring it all up to code,Mentalcomposer
we change ours every daylight savings time but we did it about a month ago,Mentalcomposer
mine are hard wired and went off one night but it stopped and then went off again  not the beep the actual fire fire,Mentalcomposer
so after realizing theres no fire we set out to figure out which detector was faulty,Mentalcomposer
in that process we changed every battery and a few of the older detectors,Mentalcomposer
of course the last one we had to check was the one that was faulty this detector was 10 years old  none of the other ones in the whole house were as old most were about 3 years old have no idea why we never changed out this one,Mentalcomposer
so now every detector has a date written on it when it was installed and every battery also has the date we replaced them,Mentalcomposer
oh and detectors usually only have a lifespan of 10 years,Mentalcomposer
seriously its been 2 years and shes still not over her ex,Mentalcomposer
its not like shes just pining away secretly shes  actively trying to meet up with him,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be her placeholder until this guy decides he wants her back and she dumps you,Mentalcomposer
im sure theres someone out there who actually wants to be with you cause this girl isnt it,Mentalcomposer
just to mention they could have had the cruise line book them up to two days prior to embark date ncl has that option,Mentalcomposer
of course that means they have to have more days off and pay for hotels and meals for those days so a lot of people cant do that or just dont want to,Mentalcomposer
personally i would never fly in on day of embark especially with an international flight its just too risky,Mentalcomposer
and travel insurance is great for this scenario but the dissapointment of missing my vacation needs to be taken into consideration also,Mentalcomposer
because it doesnt make any sense,Mentalcomposer
fed student loans were never going to cover the full cost of college,Mentalcomposer
the maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is 31000 divided over 4 years,Mentalcomposer
in the big picture this isnt a crippling amount people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back,Mentalcomposer
so the govt makes the loan the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest,Mentalcomposer
the act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them,Mentalcomposer
cancelling 10000 or 20000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself,Mentalcomposer
so that means the govt  essentially every taxpayer is paying for this relief,Mentalcomposer
i have a definite problem with continuing a program that  basically has no funding source other than more spending,Mentalcomposer
the govt is making loans to incoming freshman for sept of this year where is that money coming from,Mentalcomposer
so we cancel some amount now but what about graduates in 2024 and beyond do they get some relief too,Mentalcomposer
look i get the economy isnt great i have 3 kids that have this debt,Mentalcomposer
how about we ensure that students who took these loans satisfy their legal obligation they may have a few tough years as they begin their careers and life but it isnt like every other generation hasnt had mostly the same exact scenario,Mentalcomposer
of course some had it better at times but that is simply because of what was happening at the time and the economy and jobs and salaries all have ups and downs,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah youre fine then,Mentalcomposer
i thought it was a not seeing her ever thing,Mentalcomposer
but rethink the wedding mostly so your h doesnt have to go alone and he doesnt get all the qs about where you are from everyone unless he doesnt care then youre good,Mentalcomposer
im pretty sure shes the type that wont even notice youre there too busy being fawned over by her bridesmaids or yelling at the caterer,Mentalcomposer
while i agree she sounds unreasonableim trying to be nice,Mentalcomposer
the fact is that she is marrying into your husbands family,Mentalcomposer
which means whether you want to associate with her or not there are going to be times when you will be around her think holidays inlaw bdays children bdays family weddings not hers funerals etc,Mentalcomposer
so you have to decide how youre going to navigate all this without having the rest of the family get on your case for it,Mentalcomposer
the wedding you and h should go its his bro your parents should decline  idk why they would even want to go they babysit for you that night,Mentalcomposer
the shower you decline and just say youre working that weekend they dont need to know its on call or whatever,Mentalcomposer
any other occasions you go your inlaws are not going to take kindly to never seeing their son on a holiday because you dont like sil and maybe your h wants to spend some time with his parents,Mentalcomposer
you say hi and bye and be civil,Mentalcomposer
theres ways to navigate thru this,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the update,Mentalcomposer
amazing that they admit its their issue and still refused to refund,Mentalcomposer
good on you for going higher,Mentalcomposer
heres hoping the refund comes soon,Mentalcomposer
have a great trip,Mentalcomposer
so i found this recipe,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure its a bad meal as its 285 cal for a 4 oz serving of the beef,Mentalcomposer
just trim any remaining fat which i think youd do anyway,Mentalcomposer
but it has a very high salt content according to this,Mentalcomposer
the first recipe is how i cook mine,Mentalcomposer
just put it in a pot and boil i add the cabbage and potatoes pretty much after the beef is cooked because i dont like when they get really mushy,Mentalcomposer
i cook the vegs just until the potatoes are soft and the cabbage is cooked thru but slightly firm,Mentalcomposer
i cant help with spring break stuff but if you really have to go to key west rent a car,Mentalcomposer
miami to key west is a 4 hour drive,Mentalcomposer
and orlando to key west is a 6 hour drive,Mentalcomposer
idk where youre flying into,Mentalcomposer
absolutely agree with everything you wrote,Mentalcomposer
but i didnt mean to imply drop them at the club all day long it seems a lot of people thought thats what i meant,Mentalcomposer
so to expand on that,Mentalcomposer
just if the choice is roam free or kids club id opt kids club at least the first few days for a bit to have a chance to meet other kids,Mentalcomposer
and i said if he meets a buddy and wants to do something else have the boy set a time and him and buddy can go do that or those things,Mentalcomposer
and if he has a phone even better he can text where theyre gonna go next,Mentalcomposer
were done here going for ice cream or in the pool or wherever so at least the parents have an idea of where he is,Mentalcomposer
i think thats fair gives him a bit of free movement without mom or dad tagging along but hes with a buddy or two and can get small doses of roaming free  but somewhat controlled if that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
so just so im clear,Mentalcomposer
this is on government  or company issued devices,Mentalcomposer
if thats the case i dont have a problem with it,Mentalcomposer
what am i missing if anything,Mentalcomposer
i know about china tracking and all that but theres got to be more to it since theres such a ruckus around it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
the main thing is that this is passed on through your moms family,Mentalcomposer
your dad and especially your half sis from him have zero connection to your moms side,Mentalcomposer
thats your out this is from moms side not dads,Mentalcomposer
tell her to have her grandparents write down their recipes she can have that,Mentalcomposer
youre not even close with this half sister so i have no idea why shed even care,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt let a 10 yo roam around alone,Mentalcomposer
the kids club is where he should be,Mentalcomposer
if he meets a friend in the club and they want to do something specific like go to the arcade do the ropes course etc then he needs to ask if he can do that at a specific time,Mentalcomposer
so maybe dont put him in the club at that time but they meet up where theyre gonna go to meet the friend and then they go off but id walk him to the meeting place and at least meet the other kid,Mentalcomposer
does he have a phone so he can at least tell you where he is like after the arcade were going for ice cream then were going wherever,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your wife is being a bad mother in regards to your sons health,Mentalcomposer
your wife just doesnt want to admit that your son is unwell,Mentalcomposer
so its up to you now to help your son,Mentalcomposer
go to your son and ask him what he wants to do he seems to relate better to you anyway,Mentalcomposer
is that therapy or meds not painkillers more along the lines of an anti depressant or does he just want a semester off to stay home get out in nature or just have no stress,Mentalcomposer
dont dictate what he should be doing,Mentalcomposer
he knows hes unwell he probably has some idea what he needs at this moment,Mentalcomposer
then facilitate doing what he wants to do for himself,Mentalcomposer
she was granted legal custody and the dad asked for no visitation,Mentalcomposer
but dad was ordered to pay support,Mentalcomposer
so ill guess the court didnt decide visitation because he said he didnt want it,Mentalcomposer
now he and his whole family suddenly wants to see the son,Mentalcomposer
i really hate that every time i hear of a dog attack i automatically think its a pit bull,Mentalcomposer
but it is always a pit bull,Mentalcomposer
i keep hearing that these dogs are really sweet when trained well but these dogs were bred to be vicious,Mentalcomposer
so even if its a well trained dog there can  be circumstances where the dog will revert back to its basic instinct of being vicious,Mentalcomposer
i dont know what circumstance this could be but it seems to happen,Mentalcomposer
anyone else just curious why exactly,Mentalcomposer
his parents need a,Mentalcomposer
no doing dangerous things in the house,Mentalcomposer
rule to begin with,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
stop doing dangerous things in your parents house or you wont have a house or parents to come home to,Mentalcomposer
why do you want to be married to someone who is not in love with you,Mentalcomposer
how can you look at him a guy who lied and cheated pretty much the whole time you are together and not be absolutely disgusted by what you see  that alone would make me lose any love i had for him,Mentalcomposer
dont sacrifice any more of your dignity and pride for a guy who will cheat andor move on from you when he finds something better in a heartbeat,Mentalcomposer
i am a parent although mine are out of school now,Mentalcomposer
i would not allow anyone associated with the school to touch my childs personal laptop,Mentalcomposer
if the school is so worried they can give my child a laptop that only allows access to approved sites for schoolwork only,Mentalcomposer
id ask your parents about this whole scenario,Mentalcomposer
totally agree,Mentalcomposer
shes pushing back school so she can go on vacation with money they dont have,Mentalcomposer
if they have extra money for a vacation that money should be used to pay down the debt,Mentalcomposer
its understandable now why they have such debt,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its really presumptuous of your bro and ex sil to tell your niece you would buy her a car or even worse that youd pay for her party,Mentalcomposer
they are her parents if they want her to have these things they can buy them,Mentalcomposer
if bro and ex own both homes why did they not divide them at the time of the divorce,Mentalcomposer
this is your bros fight to fight i wouldnt do anything either he made this mess he can figure it out,Mentalcomposer
in the event mom is forced to get out then you can discuss with mom where she wants to live and if that means buying her a house then you do it,Mentalcomposer
i really dont think i can take anymore of her truth,Mentalcomposer
now if she wants to admit to the truth i might listen,Mentalcomposer
but we know shed never do that it will make her look bad,Mentalcomposer
but do you realize that the  loan you paid off including the interest actually funded the next group of kids that need loans,Mentalcomposer
the fed govt only backed those loans so they had enough money to fund the next round of loans,Mentalcomposer
i have  kids that are all paying off their loans of course they stopped when it was on pause but i told all of them to make sure they didnt spend that amount of their budget for when they had to start repaying them,Mentalcomposer
oh and my h and i paid ours off too,Mentalcomposer
i agree i think first time employees need a bit of in office experience,Mentalcomposer
you def get a lay of the land that way,Mentalcomposer
you learn the in office politics and just a general how to behave in an office setting,Mentalcomposer
i like seeing them its kind of fun seeing usually older couples riding,Mentalcomposer
i always think the guy was a biker back i the day maybe and he had to give it up so this is the closest hell,Mentalcomposer
come to riding,Mentalcomposer
and he has his partner with him its nice,Mentalcomposer
oahu was absolutely gorgeous,Mentalcomposer
enjoy,Mentalcomposer
the med on a cruise italy greece turkey montenegro,Mentalcomposer
cannot wait,Mentalcomposer
spending a few days in rome then doing a trans atlantic back to fla,Mentalcomposer
its my longest vacation cannot wait,Mentalcomposer
just find a teenager in the neighborhood to watch your kids at your home while your wife works and ask your parents for the every other weekend or whatever their schedule can do,Mentalcomposer
paying might cut into the amount of money your wife is making but you dont really have a choice do you,Mentalcomposer
even if you get the kids in daycare is your wife really going to be making enough money to cover it,Mentalcomposer
if its just a matter of her wanting to work put the little one in daycare while the 5 yo is in school and she can work those hours,Mentalcomposer
your wife cannot be mad at your parents im sure it sounded good at the time but the reality was it was unsustainable long term for them,Mentalcomposer
and thats what you should have said at the time,Mentalcomposer
i also went to one store and found mine also only tried on a few,Mentalcomposer
but i had been looking thru brides magazine  do they still have that for months i kept coming back to the same one,Mentalcomposer
and it was the one and 33 years later i still love it,Mentalcomposer
nah this person will not care what anyone else has to say,Mentalcomposer
take what responses you have gotten here and decide for yourself what your next move should be,Mentalcomposer
this is your life dont leave it up to someone who belittles you,Mentalcomposer
look at what 5pinktoes has to say about the power imbalance she is spot on,Mentalcomposer
you have none if you stay,Mentalcomposer
all of this is really odd,Mentalcomposer
why does he even care how long it took you to find a dress  he should be thrilled now you wont be stressing that  youre never gonna find one that happens a lot,Mentalcomposer
for him to get mad over this is uncalled for,Mentalcomposer
does he frequently get mad over trivial things maybe that should be a conversation,Mentalcomposer
youre not being sensitive,Mentalcomposer
every one of those examples are meant to demean you the person saying them seems to have a very high opinion of themselves and you wont ever measure up to them,Mentalcomposer
this person will not change they will not understand how these words bother you  ever,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt put up with it,Mentalcomposer
slight yta,Mentalcomposer
i understand  that in your experience laying it out so bluntly has been the way to shut down any debate but i think you should have  and in the future should explain the reasoning once if a debate ensues or your explanation is questioned then you go nuclear,Mentalcomposer
in other words nice first then nuclear,Mentalcomposer
and hey dont stress its one day it will be wonderful even if not perfect,Mentalcomposer
nothing is ever perfect,Mentalcomposer
when you feel stressed take a step back calm yourself and then go back to it   one thing one decision at a time,Mentalcomposer
suppers done roast beef,Mentalcomposer
to let d know,Mentalcomposer
you were only dating the first girl for a little over a month so i do not think theres anything wrong with breaking up with her to start dating another,Mentalcomposer
thats the point of dating you date you break up when you find someone else you like better,Mentalcomposer
i would suggest not becoming exclusive with anyone until you date for longer than a month and get to know that person better as you found out you really didnt like the way the first girl treated you,Mentalcomposer
take your time with the new girl dont go all in until youve dated for a while and make sure she is someone you have an actual real connection with,Mentalcomposer
and really get a hold of your emotions you should not be upset because you may have caused someone to be sad its going to happen doesnt make you a bad person,Mentalcomposer
and frankly the first girl doesnt sound like such a nice person with the way she spoke to you,Mentalcomposer
any partner is going to at times say something you dont like but its in those times that you think about what caused them to say it reflect and ask yourself if its justified and fight the times it is not and admit when it is,Mentalcomposer
first off dont have the open relationship talk until you have exhausted every other possible solution  keep in mind even if she says ok she may not be and she will be home with your child while youre out with another woman which could then lead to a complete breakdown of your marriage,Mentalcomposer
tread very carefully here,Mentalcomposer
so its been 4 years and she hasnt given you any explanation,Mentalcomposer
explain to her that she can no longer put off having this conversation,Mentalcomposer
theres obviously something going on with her and you need to know what it is it is not fair to you or the relationship that shes not willing to discuss a fundamental issue that you feel you are having,Mentalcomposer
yes of course caring for the baby is important but not to the detriment of the marriage there needs to be a balance,Mentalcomposer
start there and see what she says and where the conversation goes,Mentalcomposer
did you ask why what did she say the reason is,Mentalcomposer
im surprised you stayed that long,Mentalcomposer
do you miss really her or do you just miss the idea of having someone in your life  your whole schedule is all changed up maybe you just need to get into a new normal,Mentalcomposer
humans need physical touch we need to feel intimacy with our partners it almost seems cruel to me that shed withhold cuddling and kissing,Mentalcomposer
does she think you really cannot control yourself thats insulting,Mentalcomposer
do i have it right that she just decided after 6 mo of dating to no longer have sex  because you were together 1 12 yrs but havent had sex in 1 yr,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
wear what you like and have her son tell his mom that shes crossing a line with trying to dictate what you both wear,Mentalcomposer
i liked showers better when the bride or mom to be had no idea and was surprised,Mentalcomposer
your mil would have had a stroke if she saw what i wore to mine,Mentalcomposer
i didnt even know it was my shower so it was leggings and a long sweater with sneakers,Mentalcomposer
i dont think so id think they arent really hot,Mentalcomposer
like this,Mentalcomposer
these are a bit pricey so id shop around,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
candles are dangerous and a 10 yo really cannot grasp the absolute seriousness of if something goes wrong,Mentalcomposer
anyway buy her a few of the battery operated tea lights that she can place in nice holders,Mentalcomposer
shell get the effect of candles with no risk,Mentalcomposer
you know what tho its a big bday you only turn 40 once youre already splurging for the haven,Mentalcomposer
go for it  make this trip your ultra splurge for yourself im sure you deserve it live it up,Mentalcomposer
and one other tip if you drink red wine the eastwest red blend is really good its an ncl proprietary blend,Mentalcomposer
and the gerard bertrand cab is also really good,Mentalcomposer
figure out realistically how many drinks you are going to have from the premium list,Mentalcomposer
add in the cost of the excursions youre looking at taking and see if,Mentalcomposer
the cost works out to even close to what youd pay extra then id say yea,Mentalcomposer
if you really only like one or two baileys after dinner lets say then it might be cheaper to just pay for those few drinks,Mentalcomposer
and if youre gonna sit on a beach a few times or can excursions for much cheaper maybe not,Mentalcomposer
and your sis can get the unlimited wifi that she wants,Mentalcomposer
its all really a money numbers game,Mentalcomposer
but with sis not drinking i dont think youre gonna come close to it making money sense that extra  300 vs just paying gratuities on the regular free at sea drink pkg makes a big diff i would think,Mentalcomposer
i think a trip to dmv would be the next step hopefully you can get a decent person there that can help you track down where your license physically is right now,Mentalcomposer
maybe they can cancel that license and reissue one to your new address,Mentalcomposer
try having your license showing the physical address but your paperwork having a mailing address  the po box,Mentalcomposer
i know dmv  is the absolute last place you want to go but i would think thats the best way,Mentalcomposer
as far as the paperwork id use my married name show the ss card and ins card,Mentalcomposer
id make sure my insurance is in the married name like your ss card,Mentalcomposer
what do ppl who dont have dls do i wonder,Mentalcomposer
if they need more show the ss married nameold dl  maiden and marriage certificate  connect the two to prove youre the same person,Mentalcomposer
take a look at this page,Mentalcomposer
im looking into using this transport from livorno its 35 each,Mentalcomposer
but you have to get to livorno town from the port,Mentalcomposer
what they mean is you have the original invoice which shows the lower amount that you paid and shows you owe a zero balance,Mentalcomposer
that is your proof that you paid what was due,Mentalcomposer
your lower priced invoice should have a date on it and you can show that you paid the amount on the day you booked,Mentalcomposer
i would call them it doesnt seem like they actually understood what you were asking them,Mentalcomposer
they told you it was paid in full  it didnt mention anything about why the amounts changed,Mentalcomposer
make sure you explicitly say that you have an original invoice with a diff dollar amount,Mentalcomposer
im grasping at straws right now but,Mentalcomposer
it looks like its the ksf discount is it possible the child discount is dependent on the age of the child and once you corrected your sons bday it put him into a diff age category so the discount is different idk never heard it being done that way,Mentalcomposer
thats what they just dont get,Mentalcomposer
they get elected and vote or support whatever their own personal opinion is on an issue or they just go along with the party line whether they agree with it or not or whether we agree with it or not,Mentalcomposer
how about they start listening to what their constituents want we elected them to do what we want not whatever it is they want,Mentalcomposer
these people are supposed to be our voice,Mentalcomposer
since you have your original confirmation you can ask them to go over each charge one by one to find the difference,Mentalcomposer
just throwing this out,Mentalcomposer
did they maybe add on their cruise insurance  you dont have to get it but i would strongly advise you have some kind of insurance,Mentalcomposer
or did they add in the daily service charge which doesnt have to be pre paid but will be billed to your onboard acct each day you sail,Mentalcomposer
that is a cop out answer im sure she loves her kitchen at home the best but do you want your reception in her living room,Mentalcomposer
does he really want his mom cooking the day of his wedding  all day,Mentalcomposer
does she even realize that shes going to miss her sons wedding by being in the kitchen,Mentalcomposer
is she gonna take the apron off for the mother son dance at least,Mentalcomposer
come on im sure shes a great cook but she can leave the cooking to someone else and just enjoy the day,Mentalcomposer
you work and hes a house boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
but hes your house boyfriend who doesnt live with you,Mentalcomposer
so basically youre supporting some guy who you dont know and somehow think this is an actual relationship,Mentalcomposer
and you think its perfectly reasonable to buy him a car and not just any car a luxury car,Mentalcomposer
and you think the biggest problem in this whole scenario is that his parents are going to think some other imaginary girl bought him the car he just magically shows up with one day,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
he got mad that you werent looking at him while he was trying to show you something,Mentalcomposer
but  he must not have been looking at you when he started this conversation about something you should look at  or else he would have known you were looking at something else,Mentalcomposer
so he cant complain you werent looking when neither was he,Mentalcomposer
this is a stupid argument anyway,Mentalcomposer
my doc told me to just take vitamin d and calcium,Mentalcomposer
i think were trying to see if it will stave of osteoporosis,Mentalcomposer
my mom was on fosomax for osteoporosis and didnt have any side effects this was a while ago tho idk if theres newer drugs,Mentalcomposer
a nice photo album of the two of you through the years if you have any special thoughts on what was going on in the pictures you can write them in,Mentalcomposer
show him what all those years meant to you by having him in them,Mentalcomposer
and of course the obligatory 1 dad shirt or coffee mug,Mentalcomposer
i had barely knew my future mil when we got engaged of course we met but we didnt spend very much time together,Mentalcomposer
my mother had one rule,Mentalcomposer
she and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping she paid for out dress and it was a motherdaughter thing,Mentalcomposer
no friends no sisters  i have 3 no anybody else,Mentalcomposer
none of the mils had a problem with this once it was explained and my mil only had boys so she would never get that experience,Mentalcomposer
now i also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning,Mentalcomposer
so i invited my mil to the food tasting at the catering hall just me and her h was workingand brought and showed her everything we were debating on i wanted her to feel involved it was her sons wedding also,Mentalcomposer
your sil and mil are out of order definitely no argument there but mil may feel hurt and sil is fighting her battle which she shouldnt,Mentalcomposer
so maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning you dont have to take her picks or advice but at least make her feel like she is in the know so to speak and remember its her sons wedding also she just doesnt want to show up and have no idea what its gonna be like,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i absolutely love your idea,Mentalcomposer
it showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldnt handle it,Mentalcomposer
and bravo for handling the grandparents brilliant,Mentalcomposer
i think your h should be the one telling the kids he can explain why it wasnt a good idea at this time mostly because he couldnt keep up with the conditions,Mentalcomposer
he might mention it wouldnt be very fair to mom who doesnt want the dog if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
why william would ever want to even talk to h after such a betrayal is beyond me some things you just dont come back from and what h has done is one of them can you even imagine the deep hurt w feels coming from his only sibling,Mentalcomposer
i can see charles wanting some sort of relationship he is his son after all but i would like to think even charles realizes it needs to be a distant check in how you doing sort of relationship kind of like you dont wish any harm but you dont go out of your way to be close,Mentalcomposer
charles aside harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him and the wife not a snowbells chance in hell,Mentalcomposer
they had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family at the expense of family,Mentalcomposer
now they have neither the quicker they realize that the better,Mentalcomposer
from one 30 married to another ive always said thats the secret,Mentalcomposer
of course we love each other but we actually like each other thats a big distinction isnt it one im not sure some people understand,Mentalcomposer
wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you,Mentalcomposer
yeah sorry none of that is even remotely ok especially that disrespectful bs with the picture can he not have an adult conversation,Mentalcomposer
is it a matter of him not having any money but then he should have at least acknowledged the day,Mentalcomposer
does he not do anything for any special day at all,Mentalcomposer
you need a serious come to jesus talk with him how exactly does he see you and this relationship is he in love with you or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now,Mentalcomposer
sorry to be so blunt,Mentalcomposer
take a good hard look at your relationship im gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you,Mentalcomposer
the best way to act in this situation,Mentalcomposer
you reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted but its run its course,Mentalcomposer
youve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now hes moving even farther away do you really want to keep this up a few days together every once in a while,Mentalcomposer
how about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with,Mentalcomposer
info please,Mentalcomposer
ok you had the conversation but what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day,Mentalcomposer
we need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice,Mentalcomposer
it wasnt your moms fault,Mentalcomposer
your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway since you didnt your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldnt work,Mentalcomposer
was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn hindi your mom points this out but you dont actually say if this is what you wanted also,Mentalcomposer
long distance is hard your mom maybe didnt want you two separated for that long she likes your gf didnt want to see you break up,Mentalcomposer
the dream may not have happened but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture,Mentalcomposer
i dont think your mom had any bad intentions your just sad and want to blame someone,Mentalcomposer
did anyone really need a study to know this,Mentalcomposer
i love a good full salad,Mentalcomposer
but i hate all the chopping that goes into it so i make a huge salad that can last about 3 days so as long as its readily available ill eat it,Mentalcomposer
maybe try that make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that he knows hes overweight and hes probably embarrassed by it,Mentalcomposer
so i wouldnt harp on it too much for fear of making him feel even worse about it if he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels that will add to his feeling bad about himself  not saying you do this just that kids might twist it to that,Mentalcomposer
maybe just a gentle  hey kiddo covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us i worked so much i didnt really see what was going on with you or your bro im sorry im not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy if you want to or need help figuring out what we can do im here ill listen and well figure it out together and if theres anything else youre struggling with and need help well get some help i just want you healthy and happy,Mentalcomposer
then leave him alone about it maybe just give him a few extra hugs,Mentalcomposer
he knows what he has to do and he has a world of info with the internet if he wants to do it himself,Mentalcomposer
editing after seeing some of op replies,Mentalcomposer
therapy would be great but only if hes ok with it otherwise hell just refuse to talk he seems to have a lot going on teens seem to be coming out of covid with mental health issues add to that his confusion of his sexuality and its a lot for a teen to deal with,Mentalcomposer
have you taken him for a full physical covid weight gain is real but thats a lot of weight maybe theres a medical reason id at least rule that out,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
lets see if mom is willing to support her,Mentalcomposer
i get the whole dont make her pay cause im the parent and all that,Mentalcomposer
but that only works as long as you can afford it,Mentalcomposer
what kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help,Mentalcomposer
a selfish one,Mentalcomposer
your d needs to be on her own for a while shell get a dose of real life,Mentalcomposer
im not judging at all,Mentalcomposer
just saying theres a lot missing from the info they put out,Mentalcomposer
i can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas perfectly fine so i wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party not good,Mentalcomposer
how did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we dont try to kill anyone we have a problem with its a nuclear option to use sad really,Mentalcomposer
right,Mentalcomposer
so there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station,Mentalcomposer
did someone bring the 5 yo to the party,Mentalcomposer
was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire  but why would the child be out of the car,Mentalcomposer
so many questions,Mentalcomposer
time lots of time,Mentalcomposer
you need to date someone until you know them really know them,Mentalcomposer
we rush into relationship ships because we want someone anyone were so afraid of falling behind our friends our peers that we take good enough instead of good,Mentalcomposer
no guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc,Mentalcomposer
yea hes being mean and unhelpful to boot,Mentalcomposer
he needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older little people need lots of help finding their stuff,Mentalcomposer
ok  nta,Mentalcomposer
whatever she did with it she should have picked it up i dont care how busy she is shes been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days,Mentalcomposer
and then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it thats a massive over reaction,Mentalcomposer
time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse,Mentalcomposer
did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom,Mentalcomposer
how did it get soaking wet,Mentalcomposer
i heard it a couple days ago its heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy,Mentalcomposer
but i also wondered why the coaches were not required to know cpr,Mentalcomposer
even if not you try  you have 911 walk you thru it just something,Mentalcomposer
i was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts every leader,Mentalcomposer
thank goodness mine are grown or now id be staying thru every practice and game,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
im so confused,Mentalcomposer
you dated kate but never met her family for 4 years how you must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs,Mentalcomposer
next you break up with kate during college and what change colleges to the one thats a state over maybe things happen,Mentalcomposer
then you meet julia who wont let you meet her fam because she went nc because they sent her away where to take care of her sister would this be kate,Mentalcomposer
you finally meet julias fam who turn out to be kates fam and what do you know julia also lives in your old neighborhood,Mentalcomposer
and instead of acknowledging to the parents that you and kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met julia you say nothing you tell julia and shes just hunky dory about it,Mentalcomposer
and kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag that she had been pregnant in college not exactly what his think would be dinner convo but whatever,Mentalcomposer
then you yell at kate because why,Mentalcomposer
so i call bs on all of it,Mentalcomposer
so heres my very rudimentary explanation i dont own a gun,Mentalcomposer
the us is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered there was nothing except for the indian settlements but there was vast wilderness,Mentalcomposer
guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival had to hunt for food protect land and animal stock and yes even protection from horse rustlers and robbers,Mentalcomposer
so then we fight for our independence from a country who had a national army,Mentalcomposer
way back we had no central army  we had 13 colonies spread far apart and communication would take days so even if we wanted a central army it wasnt feasible so each state had its own militia to be used in case of attack by a foreign army,Mentalcomposer
thats why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms we were determined not to be ruled over again,Mentalcomposer
as the country became more industrialized and modern there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals you have to realize just how big this country is there are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness,Mentalcomposer
there are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill it was there way of life after all or they just enjoy hunting,Mentalcomposer
so while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns legally and that gets us into a whole other conversation,Mentalcomposer
so you cant bar someone from legally buying a gun in most cases it is their right but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes,Mentalcomposer
theres lots of ideas going around but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen,Mentalcomposer
while your stat is true it needs to be put in perspective,Mentalcomposer
as per this website,Mentalcomposer
we found that some 297033 children were married in the us between 2000 and 2018 232474 based on marriagecertificate data plus 64559 based on estimates table 1 a few children were as young as 10 years when they married but of those for whom age information was available nearly all96were aged 16 or 17 years of those for whom age gender and spousal information was available 78 were girls under 18 years of age wed to adult men aged 18 years or older the national number of children wed decreased each yearfrom 76396 in 2000 to 2493 in 2018 table 2but is unlikely to get to zero without legislative intervention,Mentalcomposer
so 96 were 16 and 17 hardly what most people think of when they hear  child marriages,Mentalcomposer
and the number for 2018 is 2493 total out of 350 million people,Mentalcomposer
in comparison,Mentalcomposer
one out of every five marriages in iran is a child marriage,Mentalcomposer
a total of 550565 marriages were registered in march 2018 to march 2019 in 112647 cases the bride was ages 17 years or less more than a fifth of marriages registered in iran during that year were therefore child marriages by unicefs measurefeb 9 2020,Mentalcomposer
features,Mentalcomposer
twenty percent of marriages in iran are child marriages,Mentalcomposer
iran has a population of about 85 million people,Mentalcomposer
from the same article,Mentalcomposer
data from the national organization for civil registration records that around 1100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 20172018 more recently the figure has been around 2600 girls this is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year  which is a large and significant number considering the legal obligation to secure court approval the law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is expedient to do so,Mentalcomposer
now i condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance but two 16 or 17 yos who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff  than a  12 and under literal child marrying a grown man,Mentalcomposer
how long were you dating before you moved in,Mentalcomposer
it hasnt even been a year that youve been together which means you havent even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person,Mentalcomposer
it isnt all about love thats part of the problem you think that just because he loves you hes going to think of your wants and needs all the time hell be appreciative of any little thing you do for him and the household,Mentalcomposer
youre under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will be magically better,Mentalcomposer
but the reality is hes a depressed guy who wont do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesnt have to deal with real life,Mentalcomposer
next time he tells you to leave do it,Mentalcomposer
save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life,Mentalcomposer
thank you  lots of good info,Mentalcomposer
that sounds like my kind of cruise,Mentalcomposer
what youre failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people,Mentalcomposer
thats you being selfish,Mentalcomposer
you didnt like lily because she was in effect taking kaleb away from you you didnt want to share him,Mentalcomposer
now id say you probably didnt intentionally kill her because thats just too out there,Mentalcomposer
but you also didnt try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you,Mentalcomposer
you cant claim it was just your dad you were an adult at the time,Mentalcomposer
you didnt give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her,Mentalcomposer
you wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you and when he didnt you and your dad tried to rush him along and when that didnt work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for him if he wanted anything to do with you im sure he knows exactly where to find you,Mentalcomposer
i am extra careful around mirrors and will not walk under a ladder,Mentalcomposer
i always say you never know so ill follow the superstition just in case,Mentalcomposer
now i have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor never heard that one,Mentalcomposer
have you been on any other lines and can you compare them,Mentalcomposer
im not too worried about the food im not a foodie so unless something is clearly inedible im fine,Mentalcomposer
what was the sea day activities like and the night shows and casino,Mentalcomposer
oh and i also liked pic 4,Mentalcomposer
are you a photographer because id never even think to take that shot yet its pretty great,Mentalcomposer
i think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them,Mentalcomposer
really nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of  thats where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay but the friends they went with might want to relive those memories,Mentalcomposer
of course keep any that have no nudity in them landscapes signs etc so that youd have a timeline of their travels if anyone would really want to know,Mentalcomposer
just a thought,Mentalcomposer
i dont want to come off as mean,Mentalcomposer
but were you really tricked,Mentalcomposer
you really thought a 52 yo  when he started dating you at 28 father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a baby,Mentalcomposer
some might but the majority wont,Mentalcomposer
he wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego,Mentalcomposer
if you want a child do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have and be involved in raising his child,Mentalcomposer
oh great  now well have to hear all about what they got wrong,Mentalcomposer
do these two really not have any sense of humor  laugh it off once in a while,Mentalcomposer
they must be fun at parties,Mentalcomposer
you have a lot going on so i dont know if this will be helpful or not,Mentalcomposer
but i can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and i did have the dizziness and nausea,Mentalcomposer
so that symptom may well be connected to menopause,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i cant help with anything else,Mentalcomposer
weve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child those examples are i think more the exception than the rule,Mentalcomposer
most parents dont have a favorite but we recognize that each child has something special or different that their sibs dont have one can talk to anyone anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people one is an athlete and one is artistic ones a spender ones a saver those things,Mentalcomposer
and when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that thing so the child can make the most of it for themselves,Mentalcomposer
so every child is the favorite if you want to call it that in a diff category,Mentalcomposer
at least thats how i saw and did it,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i think its perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids,Mentalcomposer
but you are too young to be left alone for a week and its your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week thats what makes your parents ta,Mentalcomposer
do you have a best friend that you can stay with,Mentalcomposer
you need to make your parents understand its the leaving you home alone that is not right,Mentalcomposer
i say go for it,Mentalcomposer
you really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like,Mentalcomposer
some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life,Mentalcomposer
others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day,Mentalcomposer
you dont know where youre going to fall in the range and youll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary short lived hard time,Mentalcomposer
surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case,Mentalcomposer
id give a student teacher a bit more leeway just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson,Mentalcomposer
but i agree the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind just in general teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn thats not a bad idea,Mentalcomposer
its repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation but invaluable for the ones that got it on the last explanation,Mentalcomposer
im still not understanding,Mentalcomposer
you park your car on the street this is not a private parking lot or something is it,Mentalcomposer
is it correct to say that your car is not blocking their driveway but is parked between two driveways on the street so in front of a home,Mentalcomposer
are you parking in front of your neighbors house and thats why they are mad they do not own the street parking in front of their home can you not park in front of your own home,Mentalcomposer
i cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket even if they have been called by the neighbor if you are not parked illegally how do you even call a traffic officer,Mentalcomposer
im not really sure what to tell you maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked legally,Mentalcomposer
or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you,Mentalcomposer
or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally,Mentalcomposer
if you dont mind can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please,Mentalcomposer
im trying to keep up but honestly its too much info thats constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense,Mentalcomposer
i thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine and mostly in youngish people,Mentalcomposer
your gf is insane none of this is normal,Mentalcomposer
she knows her big v day gift is a play she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her,Mentalcomposer
none of that was enough,Mentalcomposer
she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past failure on gift giving occasions,Mentalcomposer
hell no your gf has a way over inflated opinion of her worth,Mentalcomposer
how long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances,Mentalcomposer
this is your first relationship so im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to but ill tell you this this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out,Mentalcomposer
you should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her,Mentalcomposer
take a long hard look at what she adds to your life ill bet not much,Mentalcomposer
do you frequently feel as tho you arent doing enough do her wants and needs count for more than your own have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didnt and you gave in,Mentalcomposer
simply put shes treating you like shit and youre taking it and asking for more please time to send her packing,Mentalcomposer
it could be as simple as keeping the good stuff he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks,Mentalcomposer
or he just couldnt be bothered to pack it up and ship it,Mentalcomposer
even if you pay for him to ship it he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway,Mentalcomposer
dont read too much into it,Mentalcomposer
just write him and the keyboard off get yourself a new keyboard,Mentalcomposer
youre 2 months in it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you,Mentalcomposer
so early on is the honeymoon phase you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not you have to really know the other person warts and all as the saying goes,Mentalcomposer
work on your anger issues and see how it goes,Mentalcomposer
dont pressure her to commit long term this early it comes off as insecure needy and obsessive,Mentalcomposer
she should have some idea that an engagement is in her future so its not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesnt like,Mentalcomposer
you can then ask if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own,Mentalcomposer
we never even discussed rings at all and i love mine i looked at it like  he got what he wanted me to have she may want you to do that also,Mentalcomposer
just ask her,Mentalcomposer
i have to say that in this instance i cant imagine you would even want to see your father for a while due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom,Mentalcomposer
and its not a taking sides thing its more the way he went about leaving her it was unnecessarily cruel of him,Mentalcomposer
so youre nta for limiting contact at least for a while until you get your own anger and disappointment under control,Mentalcomposer
after things settle down a bit you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your h at your home while he visits,Mentalcomposer
hugs to your mom,Mentalcomposer
are you that busy that you cant look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have,Mentalcomposer
decide on a few styles you like go back to the jeweler and pick one,Mentalcomposer
theres no need for a middleman,Mentalcomposer
try to figure out why you are eating,Mentalcomposer
are you bored your life seems pretty active at school and when youre home youre probably bored you need to schedule more activity during the day,Mentalcomposer
or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food you might just be thirsty and if not it will at least fill you enough that you wont feel the need to eat right at that time,Mentalcomposer
also remember you arent burning as many calories at home that you do at school it may be that youre not even eating so many calories youre just not offsetting them with exercise,Mentalcomposer
but he expects you to have 23 hours to clean after looking after the house and kids all day and going to school,Mentalcomposer
im not even sure what level of clean hes looking for  i get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company but you could dust on monday and by tuesday night its back not as much but its there the kids toys shouldnt be scattered around the house but thats a 5 min task,Mentalcomposer
ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours,Mentalcomposer
very very slight yta just for phrasing,Mentalcomposer
instead of saying normal moms,Mentalcomposer
you should have said something more along the lines of  you knew we were going clubbing why didnt you have your h watch the baby for a few hours im assuming these were plans made in advance,Mentalcomposer
did she ever give a reason why her h couldnt watch the baby,Mentalcomposer
im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not and more to do with her mindset she feels shes not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear shes has a mindset that moms dont do clubbing and shes tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active she just hasnt figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode,Mentalcomposer
shes going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities,Mentalcomposer
so get more video proof id put cameras in every direction ones that can pick up sound so you have everything recorded,Mentalcomposer
you put up with it for a few years you can hang on another 6 months,Mentalcomposer
its not you but escalating isnt the way to go about it and you know the second you retaliate the cops will be showing up at your door you dont need that in your life,Mentalcomposer
think of it this way is it fair to the girl youre dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship,Mentalcomposer
no its not,Mentalcomposer
you need to tell her whats going on,Mentalcomposer
she deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely,Mentalcomposer
its a new thing so she likely isnt too invested yet,Mentalcomposer
and you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating,Mentalcomposer
im not in this fight but i found this just because i was curious,Mentalcomposer
its from 2021 so i have no idea if it is was ever implemented,Mentalcomposer
also its from a womans forum so i was surprised by their stance,Mentalcomposer
i think theyre asking what have you been given that isnt  sex because in a committed relationship sex will be happening,Mentalcomposer
its just worded oddly,Mentalcomposer
it cant be off the table and also given,Mentalcomposer
stay home make a nice dinner both agree to dress up for dinner something your so really likes that you wouldnt normally be comfortable going out in him too tho something you like to see him not thats not  the usual open a bottle of wine and spend the night connecting as a couple,Mentalcomposer
ah see i learned something new,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the diff between the two,Mentalcomposer
ah learned something new today,Mentalcomposer
thanks for the distinction,Mentalcomposer
excellent point this is a key distinction,Mentalcomposer
i perceive antisocial with being more aggressive maybe  at or when meeting new people,Mentalcomposer
but someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections,Mentalcomposer
big diff in advice to be given,Mentalcomposer
they wont let you bring them on when you board,Mentalcomposer
and they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port,Mentalcomposer
so basically no,Mentalcomposer
but i heard if youre cruising europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep  but you should confirm that,Mentalcomposer
get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle,Mentalcomposer
this way youre not paying for books you might not like,Mentalcomposer
how about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed,Mentalcomposer
theres usually a lot more nuance in the book that you cant get from the movie and you already know you like the story,Mentalcomposer
that might make you more willing to set aside time to read,Mentalcomposer
no its fine but do you understand the point i was trying to explain,Mentalcomposer
trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just lgbq people,Mentalcomposer
what youre missing is the baker wouldnt make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions,Mentalcomposer
idk anything about the gender one tho but im guessing probably the same reason but thats a guess,Mentalcomposer
its not a matter of not agreeingwith lgbtq  at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities,Mentalcomposer
but trans ppl arent as simple as a diff sexuality they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality so i think that confuses people who dont understand how that can be so its as if they dont understand it it cant be true in a sense,Mentalcomposer
adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages doesnt sit well with a lot of people theres a feeling that its too much too soon,Mentalcomposer
is it right or wrong i have no idea,Mentalcomposer
then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use sports competition moral issues like the baker and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight  and this is what were seeing now,Mentalcomposer
i liked it  im not a huge fan i knew some of the songs,Mentalcomposer
i thought it was simple but at least for the most part it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do sing her songs,Mentalcomposer
i liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good,Mentalcomposer
but i also dont like when theres so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle when theres too much going on all at once sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places that way you dont really see the whole production,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see is that youve only been with your bf a few months,Mentalcomposer
you admit yourself that you do not know him well enough or know enough about him that you need to know,Mentalcomposer
and this is why you never should have met his kids if you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave those kids will be sad and confused,Mentalcomposer
but im also confused about something is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day with an hour to spare to see you,Mentalcomposer
where is the kids mom,Mentalcomposer
was this how it was when you first met,Mentalcomposer
why cant you spend the evenings at his house and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep,Mentalcomposer
why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone elses boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
this is just plain wrong you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule nobody should have to tell you this,Mentalcomposer
stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk no good will ever come from this,Mentalcomposer
he may sleep with you but hes going back to his gf,Mentalcomposer
thats a bit harder to fix because its an issue for you but to him its not really an issue,Mentalcomposer
can you maybe schedule a few days a week i know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life but at least both of you are on the same page and sometimes it works just by the anticipation,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind would you rather have sex for the sake of having it or would you rather have really good sex,Mentalcomposer
sometimes quality over quantity,Mentalcomposer
also maybe dont put too much pressure on him start with 2 times a week and work up to 3 or however many works,Mentalcomposer
but you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term youve already spent 7 years and its not easy to leave when theres so much good but you dont want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either,Mentalcomposer
if its a matter of frequency then he doesnt see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok  and it is,Mentalcomposer
its just that yours and his do not match,Mentalcomposer
if its more a matter of what youre doing together you need to ask why he isnt willing to experiment some people just dont like some sex acts and really shouldnt be made to do them if it isnt their thing,Mentalcomposer
you matched with her first but your bro was texting with her before you started dating,Mentalcomposer
how did that even happen,Mentalcomposer
you both must have been at the very least texting or talking with her at the same time and how did you find out bro was talking to her,Mentalcomposer
look if you dont see moving forward with her just let her go  why drag it out any longer,Mentalcomposer
so does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads,Mentalcomposer
everything about this is just  off,Mentalcomposer
you pay your ex child support but you have him all day,Mentalcomposer
do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 5050 no one pays child support and then youll have time for your bf,Mentalcomposer
so dont give her access to all the money,Mentalcomposer
sit her down and show her your finances,Mentalcomposer
take the 4800 for the month minus all your household bills by now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to  food etc,Mentalcomposer
take the net  thats left and left decide how much goes into emergency fund long term savings and depending on whats left decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself,Mentalcomposer
open separate accounts for the emergency savings and one for her money,Mentalcomposer
leaving is impulsive she doesnt work and you have two small kids your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony  maybe and child support,Mentalcomposer
you say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants its still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible,Mentalcomposer
where was your mom for those 2 hours,Mentalcomposer
you should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to or your gf is so sickly contagious that its dangerous for you to be in your shared bed,Mentalcomposer
how long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry and in that time your gf went upstairs got ready for bed and also fell asleep,Mentalcomposer
oh and conveniently sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed so its a guess each night,Mentalcomposer
either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to have a fight or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her,Mentalcomposer
she really couldnt just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together,Mentalcomposer
thats pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her,Mentalcomposer
the thing you need to remember is this,Mentalcomposer
when we start to date we have no idea what were doing were all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bfgf thing so we date and we break up a lot mostly with no rhyme or reason,Mentalcomposer
who knows what your bf is thinking but dating you just isnt working for him anymore doesnt mean you did anything wrong,Mentalcomposer
stop being sad look at this as a learning lesson,Mentalcomposer
the lesson is enjoy it while it lasts take a day or two to mourn it and move on  but that doesnt mean on to yet another boy just for the sake of having a boy,Mentalcomposer
this too shall pass,Mentalcomposer
most people realize that the 2 party system the us has is not working i think mainly because theres an us vs them mentality most elected officials dont think for themselves and just go along with party lines,Mentalcomposer
thats not to say they dont personally agree with some issues but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has,Mentalcomposer
and third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there thats why the third party is looked at as a water vote,Mentalcomposer
that out of the way how does this sound,Mentalcomposer
a third party but with candidates in every state where an election is being held with a pretty centrist platform take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that or whatever it is,Mentalcomposer
national elections take place every evennumbered year every four years the president vice president onethird of the senate and the entire house are up for election onyear elections on evennumbered years when there isnt a presidential election onethird of the senate and the whole house are included in the election offyear elections,Mentalcomposer
so next year this third party could  have people running who could theoretically change  the whole look of all branches of govt,Mentalcomposer
im not gonna explain this correctly so bear with me,Mentalcomposer
how do we do this we let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states so me in state a can say i want to vote for party 3 and id like their agenda to be implemented i know one person from my state cant do anything alone but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives  we can implement our platform,Mentalcomposer
it might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party,Mentalcomposer
could be that you just dont have an actual sexual attraction to that person her being good looking isnt really the only criteria,Mentalcomposer
maybe you need to have an emotional,Mentalcomposer
attraction to a partner as well sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical,Mentalcomposer
and just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails,Mentalcomposer
for me its not about trying to hold the family together,Mentalcomposer
its more the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and i recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life it could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam it could be theres more to the story between his mom and dad that even the op doesnt know it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child,Mentalcomposer
but whatever the reason if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him,Mentalcomposer
thats just my take,Mentalcomposer
if nephew wouldnt show up anyway you might as well extend the invite,Mentalcomposer
it keeps the peace with your brother and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent you can always say that he was included and he never took you up on it,Mentalcomposer
but if you can schedule on moms weekend youd be better off,Mentalcomposer
as an aside,Mentalcomposer
im still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her childs family what did she want to happen shed raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that  dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its your money that you earned,Mentalcomposer
its not as if you spend some of it youre putting an undue burden on your parents,Mentalcomposer
the fact is even with a full scholarship there are day to day expenses that you need money for,Mentalcomposer
coffee with friends a movie gasetc,Mentalcomposer
why dont you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount dont divide all the money you have so its gone by the last month of school just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with,Mentalcomposer
youll have some spending money and youll also still have some savings when you graduate unless something big comes up in the next few years,Mentalcomposer
i found it odd too,Mentalcomposer
the woman tho i heard they have more info but not releasing it just yet something about who the man is that was seen running away,Mentalcomposer
the other guy it seems is a workplace issue the guy who killed him was an ex employee he was a gas or electric co employee so im not sure him being an elected official has anything to do with it,Mentalcomposer
now if the same guy killed both then we have a story,Mentalcomposer
honestly he sounds a bit too controlling for my tastes but,Mentalcomposer
we really dont know you nor what your individual needs are,Mentalcomposer
so if you say his what we see as controlling but you see as taking anxiety inducing decisions off of you then maybe its not as we see it,Mentalcomposer
have you tried to explain to your parents exactly how him making these decisions are actually helpful to you rather than harmful  im getting the impression they arent seeing what value they add to your well being,Mentalcomposer
this is also your first relationship so you dont really know how it should work do you you have nothing to compare him against the good and the bad,Mentalcomposer
as far as staying home after you marry it sounds lovely doesnt it until he starts complaining that youre hobbies are taking up too much of your free time and youre not dedicating enough time on his needs,Mentalcomposer
and framing it as you just arent using your time efficiently,Mentalcomposer
be on the look out for that please thats when you should reassess the whole him making decision ideas,Mentalcomposer
maybe you should work part time a few hours a few days a week just to retain some semblance of independence,Mentalcomposer
maybe start with asking her to study or out for coffee,Mentalcomposer
you and she both should spend time together to see if you actually do like each other before you commit to something like the prom  idk any proms that are soon so im basing this off the us version of a prom,Mentalcomposer
dont fall back into the its ok most days tho,Mentalcomposer
work it out now for everyones happiness yours theirs and your child,Mentalcomposer
you may open a pandoras box but wouldnt you rather know that now than years from now  yes you would,Mentalcomposer
hey im on your side,Mentalcomposer
i just meant not to bring up the money part of it in a i paid for it way,Mentalcomposer
def ok to say why are you not done yet its been 7 yrs,Mentalcomposer
i would never hire someone to clean thats just a waste of money when someone is home all day with seemingly nothing else to do,Mentalcomposer
and absolutely do not being up being able to find another partner as tempting as that may be,Mentalcomposer
but i would say i didnt sign up to be and do everything in this relationship i need an equal partner and i have to know if youre willing to step up and be a partner or this isnt going to work for me,Mentalcomposer
youve gotten some great ideas how to approach the things that need to be brought up,Mentalcomposer
please organize and use them and let us know how it goes,Mentalcomposer
yeah no,Mentalcomposer
no way my partner would be waking up mid day thats just disrespectful on a whole other level id start waking them up when the rest of the household gets up in the morning,Mentalcomposer
your poor kid even recognizes that one parent is basically useless,Mentalcomposer
thats another point you can point out to your partner  i need to sleep to get up for work and kid has in the past refused to even ask you to do a late pickup knowing you will refuse its affecting them and we cannot have that going forward its not fair to our child,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt harp too much on the accounting course but it needs to be mentioned that may come off as a money thing even if its not instead of a  it shouldnt take 7 years to finish a 2 yr program thing,Mentalcomposer
whoever cooks should be cleaning since they make the mess normally its the opposite but your partner seems unusually messy during cooking,Mentalcomposer
have that chat give yourself some time to organize what you want to say and how you want to say it,Mentalcomposer
you might as well just come out and ask if they dont want to be here anymore since this is the impression,Mentalcomposer
they are clearly giving,Mentalcomposer
send child out to a friends house i have a feeling this might not go so well,Mentalcomposer
that article was condemned by pretty much everyone that read it,Mentalcomposer
since i dont know what can they do to clarkson can they make it so he can never write for a paper again,Mentalcomposer
fine him charge him with a crime,Mentalcomposer
or will they just condemn it like everyone else,Mentalcomposer
omg yes,Mentalcomposer
especially when its only a few months in,Mentalcomposer
if youre having this many or this big of a problem after a few months just get out,Mentalcomposer
why try to save a bad relationship,Mentalcomposer
laid out like this obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair,Mentalcomposer
im curious tho how did it get like this,Mentalcomposer
you didnt just move in and you were doing the lions share was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less did partner start out as a sahp which if chores went undone it wasnt a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time but then did they just get used to not doing much,Mentalcomposer
this was me but any mention by my partner that things werent getting done caused some small level of guilt like i wasnt holding up my end of the bargain i wasnt being a good partner but thats just me,Mentalcomposer
you need a serious sit down with your partner,Mentalcomposer
does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way,Mentalcomposer
do they have a hobby that theyre dedicating all their time to,Mentalcomposer
and in a very non accusatory  way you need to ask what the hell they do all day while you are at work,Mentalcomposer
kid is in school for most of the day i can see having to drop off and pick up but partner seems to basically do nothing,Mentalcomposer
make a list divide the work and specify specific days of the week things need to get done,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason laundry cant be done every other day for instance,Mentalcomposer
its a nice thought but it really would not stop brandon from drinking,Mentalcomposer
the bigger problem is that brandon does not recognize that he is an alcoholic despite going thru rehab,Mentalcomposer
its normal to relapse but he seemingly has no plans to try to get back to sober,Mentalcomposer
and its not that you dont like the real him you actually do like real brandon its drunk brandon you dont like,Mentalcomposer
maybe your fianc should be having a come to jesus talk with brandon,Mentalcomposer
its fine if he decides that wants to be a jobless drunk but brandons friends should  be able to decide if they want to be friends with a jobless drunk regardless of how long the friendship has been,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with,Mentalcomposer
you already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another so its not a case of thinking you couldnt get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family  as some may think,Mentalcomposer
its pretty obvious she isnt treated as a d but as an adopted d,Mentalcomposer
she is your oldest child why didnt she get a car and pay for her school even if she got some scholarship you think she had to take loans so why didnt you just pick up the difference,Mentalcomposer
do you really think she does not know that shes the not wanted child shes a part of this family in name only,Mentalcomposer
i wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her she would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living family and parents,Mentalcomposer
whats the rush  with this guy or any other,Mentalcomposer
youre  in your early 20s with already one marriage that didnt make it  totally understandable and youre still not untangled financially from the first guy,Mentalcomposer
if you were with the first guy for 3 years and dating this guy for 1 year youre only 23 you got married at what 18 or 19,Mentalcomposer
this guy might be the best guy ever but maybe you should just keep your separate space for a long while longer date him while being on your own for a while,Mentalcomposer
so thats what you tell him  im not untangled yet and im not doing anything until that gets settled and im not jumping into living with anyone  until i know them inside and out and  been thru good and bad and very bad,Mentalcomposer
but why if you were happy with her and wanted to make a life with her are you so compelled to talk to women online,Mentalcomposer
you must realize that makes you pretty sleazy,Mentalcomposer
thats why shes leaving you not because of some grand scam she was trying to pull,Mentalcomposer
she might have been happy to leave everyone and everything she has back home for a better life with you,Mentalcomposer
but you didnt exactly treat her with enough respect to lay off the other women,Mentalcomposer
i dont really care that you never physically cheated just the fact that its been going on for the whole duration of your marriage is a testament to what kind of man you really are,Mentalcomposer
it just took her too long to find out,Mentalcomposer
this is all on you,Mentalcomposer
i hate saying it but youre right,Mentalcomposer
she should have never been alone,Mentalcomposer
the h knew she was having problems im sure his and her family knew even if they never dreamed in a million years she would do something like this  because who would even think it at least have someone with her just to take some of the stress of everyday life with 2 kids and a newborn,Mentalcomposer
its just so tragically sad,Mentalcomposer
is it possible that hes starting to think that hes leaving his 70 yo mom alone and thats why hes pushing for her to go,Mentalcomposer
idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it,Mentalcomposer
has he explained why he doesnt think your mom and sister cant be trusted to come with you,Mentalcomposer
thats an odd thing to say,Mentalcomposer
is he afraid your mom and sis wont contribute financially to the renting of the property because apparently his mom wont be and hes worried it will all fall to you guys,Mentalcomposer
so maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home so you and h wont be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end,Mentalcomposer
idk just throwing out ideas,Mentalcomposer
its not what they do or say its what they do or say in that moment,Mentalcomposer
if they shut down someone being rude snarky or harassing the first time it happens that goes a long way to show people that you have confidence in yourself and arent going to take any crap from anyone,Mentalcomposer
you know hes kind of down in the dumps lately i think it would be a really loving gesture for you to do something nice for him without expecting anything in return,Mentalcomposer
you can agree to watching a movie together but maybe you can make a surprise nice dinner for you two maybe his favorite just to cheer him up or a dish you make really really well pick up a candy heart and share it as you watch the movie buy a bag of those hearts with words on them and trade them back and forth,Mentalcomposer
basically make a cute romantic night in,Mentalcomposer
express to him how much you value him for him not for what he does for you,Mentalcomposer
his situation wont always be this way so support him as you would want him to support you if the roles were reversed,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
and congratulations  you should be so proud,Mentalcomposer
have you explained to your parents about the hs grad party and the sweet 16,Mentalcomposer
and why cant they just let you have this one thing that you are paying for on your own,Mentalcomposer
i would text all three of them and point these things out,Mentalcomposer
youre not asking for anything from any of them you just want to be celebrated once in your life for your accomplishments,Mentalcomposer
how they respond to the facts laid out in black and white should tell you all you need to know if they should be invited or not,Mentalcomposer
well done india,Mentalcomposer
lets look at the two people in this scenario in a 2 yr relationship that is not 100 solid,Mentalcomposer
you readily admit to mental health issues and what you are doing to help yourself get to a better place good for you in recognizing this should be your number 1 priority,Mentalcomposer
she on the other hand also has some mental health issues and is doing nothing to try to get to a better place,Mentalcomposer
now these mh issues have in some small way caused her to forget to take her pill thus contributing  not solely to the pregnancy it is totally possible that she could have taken the pill perfectly and still have a pregnancy but the chances are higher by her skipping pills,Mentalcomposer
do you really think that two 19 yos with mental health issues who cannot afford to support themselves are ready and able to care for and raise a baby,Mentalcomposer
that is the reasoning you needs to speak with his gf about the actual practicalities of raising this child not your immediate feelings not her immediate feelings the actual nitty gritty,Mentalcomposer
who is gonna work to support this little family you her both of you then who is gonna watch the baby if you two both work how are you going to afford daycare,Mentalcomposer
you both work now and still cant afford to move out of your parents house,Mentalcomposer
can either of you earn enough to support all 3 of you rent food utilities car payments doctors formula clothes etc,Mentalcomposer
it sounds so exciting to have a baby but the truth is its the hardest job in the world to raise a healthy happy well adjusted person because thats what you will be doing for the next 18 years,Mentalcomposer
and if you decide to have this baby please heed this  my very unscientific conclusion from fam and friends is that women are more fertile after having the first baby so lay off her  keep that in the back of your mind,Mentalcomposer
i have no opinion on what you and her should do i just think you both need a serious sit down to discuss the actual realities of having or not having this child,Mentalcomposer
have you explained to him that long explanations get lost on you that you physically cannot keep your attention on a long monologue,Mentalcomposer
im not so sure that eye contact is needed sometimes i have to picture what the other person is saying in order to get it,Mentalcomposer
ask him to break it up and check that youre following him,Mentalcomposer
for ex first i unscrew this got it then i take this part off making sure i dont scratch it got it  and on and on,Mentalcomposer
youll have to be honest tho when you dont get it and he may have to repeat himself but hell have to be understanding about that,Mentalcomposer
ah ok that clears up a lot,Mentalcomposer
i thought you lived with your bf family full time and that you havent been in touch with your dad for a while,Mentalcomposer
i am changing my judgement to yta just for asking bf to skip the wedding,Mentalcomposer
youre nta  for being upset that your bf didnt get a plus one id be upset at that for the fact that youre together a long time and additionally your bf is an adult and a plus one is usually how invites go for adults unless no other cousins were also  no plus ones,Mentalcomposer
im sorry if i came off as harsh wasnt my intention at all,Mentalcomposer
do you have any friends that you can spend that weekend with in your hometown that you can stay with,Mentalcomposer
you can avoid your dad and go visit your mom,Mentalcomposer
yta  maybe,Mentalcomposer
im confused as to why it takes you days to deal with your moms anniversary day,Mentalcomposer
i say this in a not mean way but in a you need to get a handle on it for your own mentally stable peace of mind,Mentalcomposer
please dont come at me yes i know everyone is different and people grieve in their own way,Mentalcomposer
i understand losing your mom was awful being young but you are an adult now and you need to find a way to deal with your feelings around this day without it seemingly being a multi day grief session that is not healthy in any way,Mentalcomposer
i lost my father as a grade schooler and my mom 10 years back so i am familiar with your feelings,Mentalcomposer
his fam saying you can just stay in the hotel is leading me to think theyve been around for this date prior and my thought that this is indeed a multi day thing is correct they may have been thinking you being alone isnt the best thing for you,Mentalcomposer
your bf will be home on the day of moms passing so thats not an issue,Mentalcomposer
he can support you however you need,Mentalcomposer
travel day is probably the next day on friday so you wont be in a happy jolly mood but you should be able to handle traveling,Mentalcomposer
the wedding is on sat emotionally you should be able to go to the wedding even if youre not the most excited there its a happy occasion so celebrate along,Mentalcomposer
your dads bday is tuesday and you will be home by then but you dont even talk to him so i dont know why this day would even be on your radar,Mentalcomposer
as far as the plus one,Mentalcomposer
that is a standard way of invited when being invited i dont know where you got the idea that you werent invited your bf is in the fam he gets a plus one hes bringing his gf,Mentalcomposer
there is a lot of emotional stuff surrounding these dates you need to talk to someone who can help you move past your grief and anger in regards to your family,Mentalcomposer
chocolate,Mentalcomposer
that weird chocolate truffle thing,Mentalcomposer
and when the father treats the white grand baby better than the step grand baby  his wife will be all  well its his blood grand baby,Mentalcomposer
this will not end well at all,Mentalcomposer
idk if her dad can change his views and mind but if hes not all in hes out,Mentalcomposer
esh,Mentalcomposer
i think amy is trying to stick it to her mom for making her wear dresses as a kid,Mentalcomposer
anyway obviously the dress code is different but its amys wedding,Mentalcomposer
but youre not going to change amys mind so do yourself a favor and just go with it its one day and unless you want to lose your d and her wife you are going to have to bite the bullet here,Mentalcomposer
your wife can wear a pantsuit that has very wide flowy pant legs that basically look like youre wearing a dress,Mentalcomposer
something like this,Mentalcomposer
these would look lovely with a dressy blouse,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
your having a baby this april and getting married next year,Mentalcomposer
really by next year you will be perfectly ok with not taking a 1 yo on your honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
now to his child how long have you been together that you havent bonded with this child im not saying you have to fall head over heels for her instantly but by the time you marry this guy you should have stronger feeling then shes a nice little girl,Mentalcomposer
marrying a guy with kids means you will be another parental figure in her life if you arent willing to do that then you are doing all of you a huge disservice he will or at least should put his d first and that means if you dont get on board youll be the one sending your child for fortnight visits,Mentalcomposer
i hate the thought that his first d will always be less to you,Mentalcomposer
dont be that stepmom be better do better,Mentalcomposer
neither of these children should be going on the vacation that youre calling a honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
you realize waiting until you each get your fill of sex with other people over a few years is never going to happen,Mentalcomposer
i think you both have this romanticized idea in your heads that this is your person when clearly it is not,Mentalcomposer
you didnt like the sex with him but then had sex with 7 other guys  but only hooked up with 2 how does that work and hated all those experiences too now suddenly the sex with him is good could it be that you realize sex for the sake of having sex is not your thing and you actually need an emotional connection to a person not just an act,Mentalcomposer
whatever is going on with you two is not sex related,Mentalcomposer
so while you both will be out there meeting others one or most likely both of you will find someone else you will want to be with long term,Mentalcomposer
youll both mature change and find that the young love you have now is not the love that will sustain you for a lifetime,Mentalcomposer
if its just a matter of being with other people then pick a number that you think will satisfy this crazy idea and get it done now,Mentalcomposer
of course that has its own problems with jealousy what you did what he did and with who it will just cause more issues between you two and youll end up breaking up anyway,Mentalcomposer
just admit this relationship has run its course and move on,Mentalcomposer
if by chance you both happen to meet up in the future and it works out then great but this isnt something that you can or should plan your life around,Mentalcomposer
i love those shows  i look at the ingredients and think  no way theyll be able to incorporate like candy corn and somehow they do,Mentalcomposer
maybe her partner should spend his time watching and getting some ideas,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if hes such a great chef he can make great meals with whatever you buy,Mentalcomposer
like those cooking shows where they have to make something from random foods in a basket,Mentalcomposer
when he gets a job and contributes to the household he can buy and cook whatever he wants,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand why he cannot grasp this,Mentalcomposer
youre talking about a celebrity who she is in all likelihood never ever ever going to meet its like being jealous of a ghost,Mentalcomposer
and there is nothing wrong with finding strangers attractive,Mentalcomposer
look there was a time where i only had eyes for my partner would actively look around and try to find someone who caught my eye  not,Mentalcomposer
to cheat just to see if there was one,Mentalcomposer
and i couldnt find one,Mentalcomposer
did i think my partner never found anyone else attractive hell no  did i think there was anything wrong with me or them no i was secure enough in my partner to know i had nothing to worry about,Mentalcomposer
its all about trust work on yours,Mentalcomposer
it sort of seems that you might be a bit insecure but in a way that you think your partner is  i hate this expression out of your league,Mentalcomposer
shes with you she likes you enjoy it and as i said in my first post stop sweating the small stuff,Mentalcomposer
if you booked with an agent then the cruise line will not be able to discuss your booking it has to go thru the agent,Mentalcomposer
so call them first to cancel this way depending on how far off the trip is you will get refunded all or a portion of the cruise fare but you will get refunded any port taxes and fees and any other pre paid add ons,Mentalcomposer
next would be the travel insurance idk who or what policy you have but usually any 3rd party travel ins kicks in after your primary,Mentalcomposer
so your travel ins may just tell you to submit all bills later on after you have outstanding bills from what your primary did not cover,Mentalcomposer
hope your wife will be okay,Mentalcomposer
i was the last in the fam to get one and i only got my first one just because everyone else in my fam had one,Mentalcomposer
kept it because i cant even imagine trying to learn a new phone system,Mentalcomposer
i know thats a stupid reason,Mentalcomposer
i am very tech challenged  started with a 5 and my 8 is still doing just fine,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
he never even realized you dont shave and he never thought you were unhygienic before,Mentalcomposer
so his argument doesnt make sense,Mentalcomposer
that is the stupidest sentence i have ever read,Mentalcomposer
if youre uncomfortable when you dress for any occasion youre doing it wrong,Mentalcomposer
generally community colleges will let you enroll regardless of gpa,Mentalcomposer
unless there is an unusually weird amount of students enrolling that semester,Mentalcomposer
make an appointment with an admissions counselor at your local and see what they say,Mentalcomposer
they have seen  and heard it all and wont judge you they are there to help you,Mentalcomposer
be prepared to take a bunch of remedial classes to bring you up to have the skills for 100 level college classes,Mentalcomposer
but thats fine i did a few when i was a returning student they helped me refresh all the stuff i forgot years ago,Mentalcomposer
you can do this you just need to start,Mentalcomposer
best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
go to the financial aid office at your school explain everything to them and see if there are grants loans emergency aid that you can get,Mentalcomposer
see if you can be an ra in the dorms for this or next semester that way your room and maybe board will be covered,Mentalcomposer
you can still keep your job too,Mentalcomposer
how is no one realizing that this teacher is taking 20  4th grade 9 yos to a water park and is what,Mentalcomposer
letting them all go off on their own wherever,Mentalcomposer
water parks are dangerous no way any school ive ever had to deal with would allow that there would be parents going and assigned a group of kids to be responsible for,Mentalcomposer
as far as this situation i would have made sure my kid didnt have to babysit the boy no one likes and only if that wasnt done would i not let her go,Mentalcomposer
and i wouldnt have bought the vip tix for the same day id have done something else with my kid,Mentalcomposer
he has an older brother who is married and has a child,Mentalcomposer
someone said it is his step bro idk about that tho,Mentalcomposer
i do remember seeing her posts tho and the bro also posted about a scholarship or something i dont remember exactly,Mentalcomposer
if you were my d this is what i would tell you,Mentalcomposer
you have seen how he is for a whole year already  do you think he is going to suddenly wake up one day and be a considerate non yelling insulting bf,Mentalcomposer
do you think if you just try harder to please him 247 then he wont ever get mad at you and call you insulting names,Mentalcomposer
i am telling you right now,Mentalcomposer
that will never ever happen,Mentalcomposer
and that his not what being a partner is you dont change and compromise for anyone just so that wont get mad at you,Mentalcomposer
this is not love you dont love him he certainly does not love you,Mentalcomposer
get away from him now before he hurts you worse,Mentalcomposer
stop dating  im serious you are way too young that this is your second abusive bf,Mentalcomposer
you need to understand that you are worth way more than you have been getting having a bf is not the be all end all find a few good friends to spend your time with or hell be alone for a bit enjoy your own company find what makes you happy that isnt a boy,Mentalcomposer
see what good relationships look like and see what the crappy ones look like,Mentalcomposer
then when you know what behavior you expect from a guy you will be able to leave when the first bad behavior comes up,Mentalcomposer
so i just looked up port charges for gc here i didnt even know this  info was available but i took a shot and googled,Mentalcomposer
it cost 726 per person plus another 3675 for the ship,Mentalcomposer
so if we divide the 3675 by the number of passengers  idk what ship so lets say 3000 passengers that comes to 012 cents per person,Mentalcomposer
so 726 plus 02 thats 728 per person,Mentalcomposer
the 10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees,Mentalcomposer
ncl gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment,Mentalcomposer
the only problem i see is in the future which most people dont think about,Mentalcomposer
hes going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together,Mentalcomposer
think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo when you are 45 hell be closer to 60 hes not going to have the energy for it,Mentalcomposer
then dont discount his health you may find yourself being his carer and thats not an easy thing to do if youre in the midst of a career or are raising youngish kids or both at the same time,Mentalcomposer
i know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun and neither has any kids,Mentalcomposer
just something to think about,Mentalcomposer
she just started a new job and believe it or not its a difficult one,Mentalcomposer
not just physically but mentally and add to that the fact that im sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right,Mentalcomposer
all that combined is a recipe for exhaustion,Mentalcomposer
she needs time time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts her at home work down,Mentalcomposer
what she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesnt give him the amount of attention he wants,Mentalcomposer
id love to see what happens next year when youre up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out,Mentalcomposer
are you going to put off studying to hang out,Mentalcomposer
i didnt think so,Mentalcomposer
frankly you dont deserve her youre too selfish,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
i am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth,Mentalcomposer
its really not a big deal,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its a perfectly normal question to ask,Mentalcomposer
your friend is hiding something,Mentalcomposer
let me guess they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
just passing on what i saw,Mentalcomposer
the cd was in ops name effectively making it the legal property of op,Mentalcomposer
grandma verbally told op to give that one cd to nephew,Mentalcomposer
op emailed nephew nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold,Mentalcomposer
op told nephew whyd it take you so long but ok ill send the check but the original cd was cashed and spent in expenses so the  is coming from me personally,Mentalcomposer
nephew responds give me my money it shouldnt take this long oh and send it to my dad,Mentalcomposer
ops lawyer advised since the cd was never in nephews name nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will op legally doesnt  have to give nephew any money,Mentalcomposer
i think i heard costa rica mentioned but idk where i got that from so its not very helpful,Mentalcomposer
and theres nothing on the costa rica reditt either so im starting to think there isnt another one,Mentalcomposer
i saw a retired military somebody on fox  dont slam me they carried the shoot down live who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed and the military talked him out of it,Mentalcomposer
this guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command,Mentalcomposer
so i think theres more to this whole incident than we know,Mentalcomposer
yes i keep trying to find one news source about that balloon,Mentalcomposer
i cant find anything other than a blip that said us military was aware of one,Mentalcomposer
very strange,Mentalcomposer
this is what youre unhappy about,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt tell you youre cute or pretty every day,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt call you by your nickname,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt ask you how youre doing,Mentalcomposer
he hasnt asked you on a date since fall,Mentalcomposer
he says hes not good at planning,Mentalcomposer
you have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for,Mentalcomposer
im sorry but you seem a bit insecure are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you,Mentalcomposer
that might be why youre going through rough patches you expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe thats just not him its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off,Mentalcomposer
thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something but you want him to do all the work why cant you plan a date,Mentalcomposer
so see youre doing fine youre covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through,Mentalcomposer
just pay close attention over the next say 6 months if hes serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids slowly at first and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together thats a big tell to me about his intentions,Mentalcomposer
ooh his wife asked for the divorce,Mentalcomposer
ill throw this out just cause i want you to think about things you wouldnt think of,Mentalcomposer
some men just cannot be alone his wife ending things regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward and im not saying he wants back with her im sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble,Mentalcomposer
im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit,Mentalcomposer
ok so i think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy as opposed to him who im gonna guess sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent,Mentalcomposer
so hes dealing with guilt of hurting the ex guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you its been a year so hes probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up  which really was a stupid thing to do the parents havent been together for a year why make this trip why not just one of the parents take the kids why this charadehas hampered his moving on but the trip will be done he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in,Mentalcomposer
also realize that his kids will always always cone first you will not have what you did in your marriage where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be plans will be ruined if theres an issue with the kids and you have to be  ok with that,Mentalcomposer
its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that,Mentalcomposer
if after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions,Mentalcomposer
but for the next few days while hes gone do something for yourself to occupy your time it might be better if you two dont talk so much a check in is enough you dont want to get jealous and he doesnt want to temper what he says to you,Mentalcomposer
and another excellent point to make,Mentalcomposer
this thread is so fascinating with all the ins and outs,Mentalcomposer
something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me,Mentalcomposer
info please,Mentalcomposer
hes separated yes  as in living apart but not with you from his soon to be ex wife seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on,Mentalcomposer
oh and there was no cheating by either of you,Mentalcomposer
then i can weigh in better,Mentalcomposer
id agree with that if  china had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted,Mentalcomposer
so they have a few weather balloon malfunctions possible if theyre trying something new and perfectly reasonable but just come out and say that before it enters into another countrys airspace,Mentalcomposer
if they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it,Mentalcomposer
even then we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force,Mentalcomposer
but until it comes down or gets forced down we wont know what it actually is and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities,Mentalcomposer
as i originally said i would have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another countrys airspace any country china should have said just that instead they said nothing,Mentalcomposer
now its possible they tried to play that story with either the us or canadian govt before it was spotted by whoever spotted it first but neither govt has said that was the case,Mentalcomposer
being that they didnt just leads me to believe that it wasnt just a wayward science balloon not to mention that theres another one and this one just traversed the country and is now over the carolinas where i believe we have large military bases  could be wrong,Mentalcomposer
theres no doubt that most govts dont trust china but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil china theories,Mentalcomposer
ill believe the us and canada before i believe anything china says and thats just based in history not just anti china anything,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
have you spoken to his bf and explained why hes not invited,Mentalcomposer
brother might be feeling its a rejection of him his bf but bf might just see the rationale,Mentalcomposer
as long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity he should understand and help to calm your bros thinking,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
are you freakin kidding,Mentalcomposer
your son has been bullied and when he finally defends himself  not start not instigate but defends himself you actually think its ok to punish him more,Mentalcomposer
you are the absolute worst,Mentalcomposer
give me a break about this one instance ruining his future no college gives a rats azz about one suspension that can very easily be explained away,Mentalcomposer
those parents want to press charges let them and counter sue for harassment,Mentalcomposer
line up every single instance that your son has been bullied by these two over the years and absolutely obliterate them in court,Mentalcomposer
be a better advocate for your son,Mentalcomposer
hes needed you in his corner for years and you havent stepped up,Mentalcomposer
do it now,Mentalcomposer
im so disgusted by you and i dont even know you,Mentalcomposer
never heard that,Mentalcomposer
ok ill wait for a third to show up somewhere else too,Mentalcomposer
i might believe the balloon somehow got blown way off course,Mentalcomposer
if there wasnt another one over south america,Mentalcomposer
two just seems a little too much of a coincidence,Mentalcomposer
i guess it might be possible both balloons got caught up in the same winds or jet stream but eh,Mentalcomposer
im not sure that your love language actually is physical touch,Mentalcomposer
im thinking that you are just starving for some type of physical touch being that from your description of family you havent ever had much much of it,Mentalcomposer
explain to your gf this and let her know its not necessarily sex that youre looking for its more non sexual physical touch and closeness,Mentalcomposer
so you can hold hands while sitting next to each other while watching tv you want to rub her arm or leg if youre just lounging around youd like a hug hello or goodbye make sure shes ok with this level of touch tho,Mentalcomposer
see if thats what youre really looking for it will satisfy you and take the pressure your gf is feeling off,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
her wanting to spend money you dont have is exactly why she is in debt,Mentalcomposer
you cleared yours probably by being diligent and prioritizing spending while she seems like shes a bit more carefree financially,Mentalcomposer
you two need to discuss finances in brutal detail and figure out if youre compatible on this topic,Mentalcomposer
as a couple you both should know whats going on with the finances and recognize that even though it may be an occasion sometimes its just not a good time to spend more,Mentalcomposer
she knows about all the expenses you told us about how can she expect to spend another 700 for 1 night,Mentalcomposer
i said it before they want the rf to admit to,Mentalcomposer
an unconscious bias in the monarchy as well as a plan to eradicate it,Mentalcomposer
they want then to admit they didnt do enough to stop bad press of tw,Mentalcomposer
even if her actions whatever they were were truthfully reported,Mentalcomposer
then they want an apology for the above two things and to admit that the stupid duo were right about everything they claim  even tho they havent laid out any concrete proof,Mentalcomposer
they wont get any of it because its all,Mentalcomposer
delusions of two disturbed people,Mentalcomposer
did you pay with a credit card,Mentalcomposer
sone cards have some level of insurance,Mentalcomposer
check that,Mentalcomposer
i totally understand keeping separate but what happens when for instance you have a baby and one of you stay home,Mentalcomposer
id imagine it would feel a little weird not having your own acct of money,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine the working spouse not being ok with the sahp having access to their acct but i was curious,Mentalcomposer
anybody experience that and what did you do,Mentalcomposer
im sorry you are going thru this,Mentalcomposer
but nows the time to be mad not sad,Mentalcomposer
much easier to forget all about him when youre so mad at what he put you thru,Mentalcomposer
so turn your thinking around be grateful you only spent 3 years with him and you have the best thing to come out of your relationship your d,Mentalcomposer
it shows just how invested he was that hes going away with his friends instead of trying to get you and his d back  be mad about that,Mentalcomposer
he has an addiction but tries to blame it in you as if you drove him to the compulsion he has nope be pissed about that too,Mentalcomposer
he lied for years get mad about that,Mentalcomposer
you are going to have an amazing life and youre gonna do it all by yourself you dont need him,Mentalcomposer
so i guess serious humanitarian content highlighting their save the world complex is out,Mentalcomposer
great one more thing they wont get right as they know nothing about romance or comedy,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand who the victim is,Mentalcomposer
my point was trying to say that she has a preconceived notion of what this country is like and the only way he may get her to change that is to show her sounds reasonable to me,Mentalcomposer
she may go and hate it but at least she was there to make an informed decision by him cancelling the trip he may have in her mind validated what she has been thinking all this time she can then think to herself see he knows its awful thats why he gave up trying to get me to go,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt say he has to cure her of anything more like getting her to be more open to exploring something out of her comfort zone its been over 10 years maybe just putting up with her for another month wouldnt have been the worst thing,Mentalcomposer
a mid range mobile will do the same things as a high end one talk text and data,Mentalcomposer
what else would you use it for youre not really gonna be able to do schoolwork on it,Mentalcomposer
so go better on the laptop,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
i also think it depends on how often you are trying to get the guys together,Mentalcomposer
something every weekend thats not gonna happen no mom wants the dad out having fun every weekend while she gets child care duty,Mentalcomposer
something like a dart league is a weekly commitment most working people  not just dads are probably reluctant to commit to that  as its just another thing to add to the list of somewhere i have to be on that night every week,Mentalcomposer
instead of just trying to get the guys together invite the couples over with their kids to watch a game play a game or even just to hang out,Mentalcomposer
the guys only should be an occasional thing,Mentalcomposer
he had the side with the outlet for the alarm clock since he got up first,Mentalcomposer
then we had to switch cause the baby cradle only fit on that side of the bed its been that way ever since,Mentalcomposer
honestly you sound so desperate to find a partner and that desperation will become apparent to anyone you happen to meet thats not a good thing,Mentalcomposer
you need to figure out why you feel that the only way to be happy is with a partner,Mentalcomposer
there are always times in everyones life where they are single that in itself should not be as big a deal as you are making it out to be,Mentalcomposer
go out with friends join a club pick up a new hobby do something anything just for yourself something that you enjoy,Mentalcomposer
stop expecting someone else to make you happy,Mentalcomposer
youre so young enjoy this time of your life your person will come at the right time,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt want to date you anymore thats the reason,Mentalcomposer
but youre gonna hang on waiting for him to come up with some kind of problem or issue he has with you or your relationship and think together you can fix it did you ever think he doesnt want to fix it whatever it is if there even is a thing,Mentalcomposer
or theres no fixable reason he outgrew the relationship hes bored youre not what he wants anymore he met another and wants to pursue her but wont cheat on you so he breaks up,Mentalcomposer
just move on stop trying to figure it out hes not worth any more aggravation youll make yourself crazy,Mentalcomposer
agree totally,Mentalcomposer
why would she or anybody really fight for and want to be with someone who doesnt want to be with them,Mentalcomposer
ive always had that attitude which is why i get over heart break pretty easily  first im hurt and upset then i realize they dont want me so i just move on,Mentalcomposer
which is what op should be doing,Mentalcomposer
yeah but theres something about seeing a foreign country with a native,Mentalcomposer
thats when and how you see all the great local things on offer,Mentalcomposer
its just sad she wont experience thatespecially with you her h,Mentalcomposer
but you wont convince her if she never goes there,Mentalcomposer
best thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things she moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didnt convince her,Mentalcomposer
she needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down,Mentalcomposer
but also shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there,Mentalcomposer
oh ok then itll be fine,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to do anything,Mentalcomposer
let it cool id wash it and youre good,Mentalcomposer
dont touch it till it cools off,Mentalcomposer
if there was nothing in the pan what happened to the pan,Mentalcomposer
have you told him you dont feel like you two are connecting since youve had the kids,Mentalcomposer
you need to sit him down and lay it all out,Mentalcomposer
tell him he has to decide what his priorities are is it you and the kids or his sailing,Mentalcomposer
if its his family then he needs to be present not just for the kids but for you as a woman and his wife,Mentalcomposer
explain he cannot possibly be giving his all to  his job his kids his wife and his hobby something gets pushed to the back burner and you feel like its you and that needs to change,Mentalcomposer
not a threat just a statement of fact youre not getting what you need from him and if youre not then why should he even be there,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and you admit its not 100 so why are you still there,Mentalcomposer
this should be the honeymoon phase where everything is great 2 ppl finding out everything about the other sharing stories of their lives their families etc,Mentalcomposer
not constant back and forth push and pull,Mentalcomposer
please find someone closer to your age in the same stage of life as you thinking about and going thru the same things as you,Mentalcomposer
youll find it a much easier happier relationship,Mentalcomposer
i didnt go away to uni but dont most people have a roommate or 2 or 3,Mentalcomposer
i would think you start there youre all in the same boat not knowing anyone so you pal around with the few you do know,Mentalcomposer
you can expand that into the others on your floor i heard keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way i guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi idk,Mentalcomposer
then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way,Mentalcomposer
eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends,Mentalcomposer
you should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when hes never even met you,Mentalcomposer
that screams scam to me,Mentalcomposer
you dont say how long youve been together but i would delay moving in,Mentalcomposer
yes we all did,Mentalcomposer
but youve been with him for 2 years,Mentalcomposer
that alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him if you do not then why on earth would you have moved in with him,Mentalcomposer
you have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to put up with your constant insecurity forever,Mentalcomposer
thats not how a relationship works you trust until they give you a reason not to and he hasnt so count your blessings stop looking for drama and have a stress free life with the guy who wants to be with you,Mentalcomposer
stop this you are way too old for this kind of stuff,Mentalcomposer
even if the bag is back in there do you really think his 11 yo son even wants them heres a clue no he doesnt,Mentalcomposer
oh silly me  i totally discounted the happy part,Mentalcomposer
i hope op updates as each of your timelines comes to fruition,Mentalcomposer
oh come on shes actually going to make you move out over a guy who she just met,Mentalcomposer
thats ridiculous  whats he gonna want next,Mentalcomposer
she needs to tell b that he hasnt been around long enough to start dictating who or what she can do with her apt and her life,Mentalcomposer
have a chat with a shes acting irrational over a guy,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine how hed act if there was a big problem,Mentalcomposer
perfectly fine take a class as an elective on what may interest you and youll find it,Mentalcomposer
you are someones perfect person you just havent met him yet,Mentalcomposer
do not settle for anyone who is not all in for you,Mentalcomposer
you will get over this one and move on to someone better,Mentalcomposer
congratulations  you earned it,Mentalcomposer
what are you thinking of studying,Mentalcomposer
you will do great,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of,Mentalcomposer
wow and your dad has nothing to say about that  hes the biggest ah of  them all,Mentalcomposer
sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom,Mentalcomposer
you need a little chat with dad about what she said,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
sm actually acknowledged that your dad put her before his own kids as if thats something to be proud of,Mentalcomposer
wow and your dad has nothing to say about that  hes the biggest ah of  them all,Mentalcomposer
sm would not be getting any apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom,Mentalcomposer
you need a little chat with dad about what she said,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses,Mentalcomposer
its one thing to spend time with a so its another when shes there for days at a time,Mentalcomposer
theres no reason she should be freeloading off you three,Mentalcomposer
you need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there and if shes visiting she doesnt get to crank the ac eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home not that she can hang around all day while hes at work,Mentalcomposer
someone correct me if im wrong please and ill delete this,Mentalcomposer
i think the point is that piers got fired from what i think was a pretty big morning news show when he dared to say probably amongst other things that he didnt believe what m claims,Mentalcomposer
so the fact that he was in a sense markled  lost his livelihood and now hes back because he has an interview with the pm which is a big deal,Mentalcomposer
a couple of things off the top of my head,Mentalcomposer
if you can wait until after labor day a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids,Mentalcomposer
idk how big the ship you mentioned is but i would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesnt like crowds id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less there may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has,Mentalcomposer
we just returned from a carnival cruise  out of miami and there were a bunch  of lgbt couples and groups i dont know if it was the ship  celebration very big or the port or that ccl has lgbt meet ups on all their ships which is attractive to the demographic but i didnt see or hear anything disparaging  i realize im one person so that doesnt mean much,Mentalcomposer
this might cone off the wrong way,Mentalcomposer
but i dont know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends its absolutely not my intention idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife  see this part i didnt know how to phrase who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting,Mentalcomposer
i know people hate carnival but ive been on them and ncl and really enjoy both lines carnival has really fun deck parties,Mentalcomposer
id go back anyway i cant possibly have another accident right yup im going with that,Mentalcomposer
we have 3 more booked for later this year,Mentalcomposer
but yeah it seems they arent gonna bill me which works for me  saves me from dealing with the insurance company,Mentalcomposer
seriously needing evac is my absolute worst fear,Mentalcomposer
being so badly hurt that  they want me off the ship is terrifying,Mentalcomposer
yeah had to do the report also,Mentalcomposer
they even took pics of my sneakers which i sort of understand in a weird way,Mentalcomposer
i would like to think its so they can see if theres a pattern to where and how accidents happen idk,Mentalcomposer
thats what i was thinking since it happened on the ship,Mentalcomposer
sounds like me hurt on day 2 it def put a damper on the vacation,Mentalcomposer
im sorry your dad went thru that,Mentalcomposer
its scary when youre away from home and dealing with medical issues,Mentalcomposer
thats what i expected to happen its just really odd that they havent charged me yet,Mentalcomposer
i have allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if i do have to claim,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah i def misunderstood your comment,Mentalcomposer
sorry,Mentalcomposer
ill just wait and see what happens,Mentalcomposer
that is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance,Mentalcomposer
it covers the usual trip cxl and delay lost baggage etc but i got it mainly for medical and evacuation,Mentalcomposer
i tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle so really not their fault not my fault just a misstep  i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers it was just a freak thing,Mentalcomposer
they did tell me upfront that they dont take insurance which i knew and what all the charges would be for the doc and xrays after that i didnt really care what the charge was for  the cast just do what needs to be done,Mentalcomposer
i did have to speak to security for an accident report maybe that has some bearing also idk,Mentalcomposer
i figured theyd put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc,Mentalcomposer
i guess ill just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point its been 6 days since i went to medical but only 2 days since debark,Mentalcomposer
thanks yeah my bill will def be higher than that so it cant be a threshold thing,Mentalcomposer
i was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did weird,Mentalcomposer
nailed it in one,Mentalcomposer
perfect,Mentalcomposer
im a bit confused,Mentalcomposer
what exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad,Mentalcomposer
the only clue i got was you feel uncomfortable and  or unwanted by him is this a result of the pregnancy is it a weight issue or what,Mentalcomposer
no way in hell would i ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor that will only give her more ammunition,Mentalcomposer
you have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said,Mentalcomposer
her baby is small she has to find something to brag about,Mentalcomposer
both these babies are under a year old do i believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles idk i guess its possible will he continue on that same path who knows,Mentalcomposer
dont engage her at all if she makes any kind of off comment ask her straight up what shes trying to say put her on the spot,Mentalcomposer
i was going to point this out,Mentalcomposer
hes using the majority of the food budget on his food and she has to basically eat whatever fits the budget,Mentalcomposer
thats some bs right there,Mentalcomposer
op make a new plan that takes food out of the shared acct each of you will then pay for your own food order for the week,Mentalcomposer
thats the only fair way he cannot hog the food budget and then make you feel bad that he has to add more money to it let him see exactly how much of that budget he has been spending,Mentalcomposer
and stop eating crap food you work you can afford to feed yourself whatever you damn well want to eat,Mentalcomposer
this is some serious next level shit with the sister,Mentalcomposer
i agree your h should be the one to shut his sister down every time,Mentalcomposer
but if hes not around heres some ideas,Mentalcomposer
her baby is younger it is not supposed to and is not going to be at the same developmental point as any other baby born before it including yours,Mentalcomposer
how to deal with her  every single time she tries to make comparisons between babies just repeat  oh im positive both  kids will reach every milestone when they reach it no rush,Mentalcomposer
or something to that affect,Mentalcomposer
do not engage in the tit for tat  her baby does this so you point out yours did or dies that,Mentalcomposer
all that will do is make her compare more,Mentalcomposer
just be very meh about everything she may just get tired of goading you when she sees you wont engage,Mentalcomposer
of course she may double down and get mean or snarky about you your baby or your relationship ship with your h in that case she went overboard and you are allowed to let loose on her,Mentalcomposer
this is what i think they want,Mentalcomposer
the family to make a statement admitting to some kind of,Mentalcomposer
unconscious bias within the monarchy along with a pledge to stop it,Mentalcomposer
an apology for not making sure the press didnt print anything disparaging against his wife in other words for not protecting her,Mentalcomposer
to be brought back to their half in half out as a way for the fam to make amends for being proven right about their accusations,Mentalcomposer
of course none of this will ever happen but the two of them somehow will keep pushing and pushing until they are proven right,Mentalcomposer
but they havent proven any of the accusations they have made so i dont know how they think their delusions will ever come to fruition,Mentalcomposer
they absolutely have no leverage against the family,Mentalcomposer
ive been out of the loop for the last 2 weeks so im not even sure where their support or popularity is at this point but if its low after all the interviews and his book they should seriously be looking at just working quietly on their humanitarian work if there really is any  and stop trying to get a pat on the back every time they deign to speak about any subject,Mentalcomposer
the thing is the only real choice you have in that instance is whether you are going to be involved in the childs life,Mentalcomposer
the mom can take you to court for child support and then you will be required to pay every month for the upkeep of the child,Mentalcomposer
so if youre going to be paying anyway you might as well just be involved,Mentalcomposer
that child will grow up and might come looking for you what possible explanation can you have for never being involved,Mentalcomposer
you were too young well you werent always that young,Mentalcomposer
you werent ready to be a dad well she probably wasnt ready either but she did it anyway,Mentalcomposer
it seems so easy to just walk away but will you really be able to just forget that your child is out there somewhere maybe not having a great childhood because you just couldnt be bothered to take any responsibility,Mentalcomposer
that is awesome,Mentalcomposer
great job,Mentalcomposer
how big is it,Mentalcomposer
she wasnt technically stripped of us citizenship she was never supposed to have it  if she legit ever did,Mentalcomposer
she is still a yemeni citizen because her father was a diplomat of yemen,Mentalcomposer
maybe she should ask yemen to let her in,Mentalcomposer
too bad so sad stay where you are,Mentalcomposer
jellyrolls is a dueling piano bar thats a fun night out,Mentalcomposer
the abracadabar is nice for a drink or two,Mentalcomposer
i think the boardwalk has brought back the entertainment could be a magician juggler etc they set up and put on a show for a bit,Mentalcomposer
theres a few boardwalk games for a fee basketball throw hit the lobster into the pot water gun race,Mentalcomposer
so basically walk the boardwalk and see what appeals to you,Mentalcomposer
we absolutely love the boardwalk  enjoy,Mentalcomposer
idk why but i like this question,Mentalcomposer
originally h took the side with the outlet for the alarm clock cause he had to get up earlier than me,Mentalcomposer
then we moved and kept the same sides until the baby came then we had to switch cause the bassinet only fit next to his side of the bed,Mentalcomposer
we just havent switched back,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
all you accomplished was to make your d and h mad at you and made your d miss her sisters wedding,Mentalcomposer
im not a fan of the emo look but thats what your d likes,Mentalcomposer
she put the dress on and added what she needed to be comfortable in it thigh high slits are fine on a formal dress have you seen what sweet 16 and prom dresses look like i just would have wanted it to be finished not just a scissor slit if thats what it was,Mentalcomposer
no one was going to care some ppl might have looked at her commented to their so and then went on with the festivities,Mentalcomposer
i highly doubt your d was planning on parading around the hall so everyone could see how edgy she was,Mentalcomposer
but bower says it was violet that set them up,Mentalcomposer
if the story about the insta crap was true why would she send violet flowers,Mentalcomposer
i have a 2 problems with scobies,Mentalcomposer
if im following this correctly,Mentalcomposer
the timeline,Mentalcomposer
h says the baby was already born when the in labor statement was made,Mentalcomposer
ok but did h or m even ever tell anyone that she was in labor,Mentalcomposer
so for him to be all butt hurt that it was a lie was actually his own damn fault for not telling anyone,Mentalcomposer
i am sure if the palace was told shes in labor they would have released that at that time,Mentalcomposer
so the fact that she labored gave birth and was already home by the time the in labor statement came out points to me that they purposefully withheld that info from anyone,Mentalcomposer
he wanted no press so he got no press so why bitch about it,Mentalcomposer
the fact checking,Mentalcomposer
he says there were things he didnt put in the book that were told by the place but couldnt be fact checked so he left them out ok that would be a good thing,Mentalcomposer
but when told by the harkens people about the titles he took that at face value and reported they didnt want title for archie so no additional fact checks in that one,Mentalcomposer
so he takes what their comms team says as fact and it turns out to be false but doesnt take the palaces statements as fact of course we dont know which ones they are because we have to wait for his second stupid ass book as if theres some big revelation to be revealed,Mentalcomposer
this is exactly where im at even commenting that we really should do ncl more we even have 2 cruise next certs that we have to use at some point,Mentalcomposer
i really like ncl but the ccl offers are just too good to pass up and as you say the diff is pretty small,Mentalcomposer
i also like that i can see my ccl offers online and dont have to call to find out what they are,Mentalcomposer
with ncl i have to call they look up my acct and tell me what my offer is then since its a casino offer i have to pay that extra 20 pp per day admin fee and honestly for the time and money spent in the casino on ncl my offers arent that good,Mentalcomposer
so ill stick with ccl until i find an itinerary on ncl that i cant get on ccl,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its a ridiculous caveat on the trust,Mentalcomposer
is it even legal what if it stated you had to marry a certain woman could that be upheld,Mentalcomposer
but really you should have never confided in your sib,Mentalcomposer
should have made like you were cheating kept the ruse going pretend fight and then make up,Mentalcomposer
now sib is gonna tell the lawyer and theres gonna be issues or not the lawyer might think its a ridiculous rule too and just overlook it can they do that,Mentalcomposer
im guessing this is about knees,Mentalcomposer
and even an obese person needs those to walk,Mentalcomposer
painful knees while walking leads to less walking leads to weight gain,Mentalcomposer
sometimes its just a vicious never ending cycle,Mentalcomposer
what if that painful knee was from a horrific accident that had someone laid up in a hospital for months should they have not eaten all that time to not gain any weight,Mentalcomposer
dont judge you probably have no idea what someone has been through,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
its not for you to decide they are the parents and they can figure out their own stuff,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure you just ruined your relationship with your future sil,Mentalcomposer
the most logical solution is to move game night for the boys to brothers house,Mentalcomposer
he keeps the kids and does what he needs to do in between playing,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt even have to play he can just hang out with the guys,Mentalcomposer
but at least everything he needs is in his own home,Mentalcomposer
and his wife gets a needed time off to enjoy something just for herself,Mentalcomposer
who knows he might even get some help with the twins if they both wake at the same time,Mentalcomposer
nta for not wanting to spend v day as a double date,Mentalcomposer
but  she really didnt do anything wrong to you personally,Mentalcomposer
her parents enabled her and now her bf has to put up with her,Mentalcomposer
just tell your wife you want to spend the day with just her thats kind of the point if that particular holiday,Mentalcomposer
how did they even know you commented here,Mentalcomposer
do they go and look at every single person who has ever been on that site every day to see what they post,Mentalcomposer
sorry if this is a stupid q i dont understand,Mentalcomposer
she cannot possibly think any kind of project that has anything to do with her time in the rf can help to worm herself back in,Mentalcomposer
if anything the shut door will now be padlocked,Mentalcomposer
youre assuming that anyone else knew,Mentalcomposer
its not hard to announce a pregnancy use the moon bumps all along tell someone she went into labor when the surrogate actually did and then present the baby,Mentalcomposer
do we know that she saw a royal dr and theres that weird remark from h that babies grow so much in2 weeks when they showed him publicly,Mentalcomposer
and for all we know they could have contracted with a surrogate in a legal country,Mentalcomposer
idk where i stand on the real or fake pregnancies but i wouldnt put it past them to lie to everyone precisely because of the los issue gotta get that sweet sweet royal heritage,Mentalcomposer
oh i totally agree we were young  2326,Mentalcomposer
im happy to say it worked out tho 33 years 3 independent kids who are in no rush to marry and were retired,Mentalcomposer
we made it work but we also were done with school had a house and waited 4 years to start our family,Mentalcomposer
everyone has to do what works for them i would never tell anyone to do what we did just because we did it,Mentalcomposer
so you shouldnt,Mentalcomposer
its actually very smart to wait if its for your education i believe that a masters program only comes with a small stipend to live on so how exactly would you and a wife who im assuming is close to your age going to support a household,Mentalcomposer
and of course the girl is going to be traditional also  and is going to want to have children too the pressure from both families would be unbearable,Mentalcomposer
stick to your decision i could not even imagine being married that young  and i married at 23 but we were both already in our careers,Mentalcomposer
its not a big deal thats the point,Mentalcomposer
h just wants to make it seem like it is,Mentalcomposer
you know cause his witch of a wife is just so caring she would be able to comfort everyone  while taking copious notes on everyone and everything for her tell all,Mentalcomposer
i have found that the best way for me to retain info is to write it down,Mentalcomposer
so in class take notes,Mentalcomposer
and then when you have to actually study for a test re write what you need to know organize it so it makes sense to you,Mentalcomposer
the act of writing it helps to retain it,Mentalcomposer
nta for initially being angry but at this point when she brings it up youve got to not engage with her,Mentalcomposer
just tell her youre not having this convo again its done and over and she can either get over it or get out,Mentalcomposer
why did she go thru your phone,Mentalcomposer
7 mo in she has no right to info about your money,Mentalcomposer
if she lost all trust in you then that was the time to break up,Mentalcomposer
youve been rocky since then so you have to decide if this is what you want or not,Mentalcomposer
any relationship that is that much strife and aggravation isnt worth it to me,Mentalcomposer
i didnt mean to disparage your step mom but its human nature for her to prioritize her bio kids,Mentalcomposer
its worth at least a convo with your dad,Mentalcomposer
dont ask questions you dont want the answer to  especially during sex with your wife never mind you going soft i would have kicked you out of the bed,Mentalcomposer
but really what she did  with her time and body before being committed to you is none of your concern,Mentalcomposer
you are a grown man stop pouting that you didnt get the girl first,Mentalcomposer
you were gone for years was she supposed to sit home pining for you,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see is that even if you are still contributing your 50 share to expenses that money is coming out of somewhere either your savings or your retirement funds,Mentalcomposer
great that you have them but at some point they will run short or be depleted,Mentalcomposer
at that time you will be expecting your partner to pay all expenses,Mentalcomposer
do you realistically have enough of your own independent money to support half of this household for another 30 years because you very well could live that long,Mentalcomposer
your combined cash and investments seems like a lot but half of that  lets say your half if its evenly contributed is 750000,Mentalcomposer
750000 divided over 30 years is only 25000 per year obviously with no growth,Mentalcomposer
is that enough for you to cover your half for 30 yrs,Mentalcomposer
how about when your partner retires will your own money be enough to travel if you feel like or to do whatever you two have talked about,Mentalcomposer
you need to add some income to this partnership if you want it to remain happy and healthy,Mentalcomposer
yea you should bring it up to your dad,Mentalcomposer
not in a confrontational way but more in a maybe he doesnt realize this way,Mentalcomposer
he might be under the impression that step mom would be a decent person and split the inheritance when she passes equally when there isnt any guarantee of that,Mentalcomposer
point out that the majority of his and wifes assets are from him  and not her,Mentalcomposer
ask him if hed be ok with his bio kids being totally cut out when step mom passes and does he really think shed have any sense of loyalty to kids that arent hers,Mentalcomposer
the most equitable way is for him to leave half to step mom if he predeceases her and half to his bio kids,Mentalcomposer
then step mom can divvy up her assets to her kids when she passes,Mentalcomposer
you say he didnt want another child and left his ex wife to completely raise his younger son by herself,Mentalcomposer
does this mean that he is involved with the first one,Mentalcomposer
yes thats what it means the ship wont actually leave cape town till 4 on sat and then you dock in richards bay on tuesday and the boat leaves the next day at 9 pm so you can usually stay out as late as you want before returning to the ship to sleep,Mentalcomposer
im not sure how embark would be tho do you actually have to board as usual which would mean be on board at least 2 hrs prior to departure timedo the muster and then are free to get off and explore  of course usually people get in the ship way before the 2 hrs prior,Mentalcomposer
might just want to ask that you dont want to show up at 5 pm with your bags and check in was meant to be done earlier,Mentalcomposer
just leave her alone about this topic,Mentalcomposer
shes 19 a lot can change as she gets older,Mentalcomposer
im surprised one day with kids did it actually most people would have the attitude of my kids wont be like that or recognize 4 kids is too many,Mentalcomposer
maybe shes actually onto your little ploy and is screwing with you that would be hysterical,Mentalcomposer
that quote from your dad is great,Mentalcomposer
im filing that away to use if i need it,Mentalcomposer
you are being completely irrational on this issue,Mentalcomposer
they dont see each other on a regular basis they live far away from each other so im guessing at this point they phone or text each other probably when theres something to say other than an ongoing keeping up with each others lives,Mentalcomposer
why is this one person so threatening to you  im sure theres other people that your bf has dated or hooked up with in the same city you live in where it would be more probable that you would run into,Mentalcomposer
could it be that you are jealous that he has such a lifelong friend who probably knows more about your bf than you do k knows everything your bf has done and thought since grade school its not a nice thought that someone else knows your partner that well but its also a testament that your bf can keep a relationship going for so long thats good for you in the long run,Mentalcomposer
your bf may say hell be ok cutting contact but somewhere in his mind hes going to be sad that his one constant in his life is gone that might lead to him unconsciously resenting you because youre the reason for that severing of ties,Mentalcomposer
you should meet k with a complete open mind you may hate him for legit reasons or you may just find that hes a genuinely good friend to your bf and your fears whatever they are will be alleviated,Mentalcomposer
a lot for you to think about here but dont borrow problems that arent there,Mentalcomposer
that age gap its gonna become a gaping chasm,Mentalcomposer
i have a friend who married with a 20 year gap she was spry and adventurous into her late 40s bad knees got her he was all but housebound happy to stay home with the pets he was tired and the health issues started cropping up,Mentalcomposer
thats what youll get caring for a 70 year old at 50 and if you have kids,Mentalcomposer
youll have a 70 yo h and a teenager,Mentalcomposer
hes a 50 yo mean man with health issues who thinks he hit the jackpot,Mentalcomposer
with his much younger gf,Mentalcomposer
and what do you get out of this you get to be his nursemaid when his ills come up and you get to take the brunt of his nastiness,Mentalcomposer
cut your losses find someone closer to your age and in the same stage of life you two can grow old and sickly together but hed probably be a lot nicer to you,Mentalcomposer
who are the same forces that are controlling j epstein,Mentalcomposer
i thought he was top of the food chain,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
youre n t a for wanting bro out but,Mentalcomposer
i have a diff take,Mentalcomposer
your h bot the house are you an owner also i understand being married but it will make a big diff to bil if you tell him whats gonna happen the whole fam will be told you threw him out and its not even your house  just saying what bil will say not that its true,Mentalcomposer
you are more than expected to shut him down with any rude comments he may make and shut him down hard find anything you can that he may be sensitive about and use it,Mentalcomposer
but your  h is the one who should be handling his brother as far as moving out you and him have to get on the same page and he needs to deliver it to bro,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
he needs to find a new psych  and get his own prescription and if he has no insurance hes going to have to it for the visits,Mentalcomposer
its ridiculous that youre sharing medicine one of these months you are going to really need it and its not going to be there then its gonna be a big problem,Mentalcomposer
and if hes taking 3 a day how many are left for you its nice that you might not need all of it but why should you not have it when you do need it,Mentalcomposer
thats fair sorry i was trying to see if theres a pattern of behavior,Mentalcomposer
you know him best think back and ask yourself,Mentalcomposer
is this how he always was,Mentalcomposer
if yes then in a way you allowed him to think youd always do the work and hed benefit from it,Mentalcomposer
then a division of chores needs to be struck and he has to agree to then if he doesnt theres your answer he will not ever change,Mentalcomposer
if he used to be a more involved partner,Mentalcomposer
then you need to figure out what happened that he suddenly took a turn for the worse,Mentalcomposer
do a huge self reflection on the whole of your relationship thru all of it see if there were things you missed or you overlooked thinking hed be better or do better as time went on,Mentalcomposer
youre so young and its scary when your life is not turning out how you thought it would  it can get better but he has to be willing and he at 27 should be acting like a h and father instead hes acting like a teenager who has a part time job for gas money,Mentalcomposer
do not be afraid to break up if you think its the best for everyone involved including your baby i will add if the issue with your fam was due to something about him and you chose him it might be time to mend that relationship best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
im gonna need to know what happened with your parents,Mentalcomposer
where did you live before this apt,Mentalcomposer
i really do not know why you would even entertain the idea of staying with him at this point,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt have a full time job he doesnt help you with anything hes semi neglectful with your 8 mo old probably because hes too preoccupied with gaming and when you finally had the guts to call him out for all that he pushes you,Mentalcomposer
how much are you willing to put up with how far is too far,Mentalcomposer
my advice go back to your parents tell hubby he needs to become a self supporting stable adult if he wants any type of relationship with you,Mentalcomposer
then hold him to it he needs a full time job and he needs to be able to support an apt on his own a couple sessions with a therapist would be a bonus maybe hell realize hes a father and he needs to become a partner in this marriage,Mentalcomposer
you should have just told her you werent going  to see her again after you found out she had a bf you dont have to be mean about it what she does is her business,Mentalcomposer
you might have thought by blocking her it was a slight to her but it didnt slight her in the least shes looking for an explanation give it to her tell her to leave your friends alone and then the block her,Mentalcomposer
this is a really nice picture youre very talented,Mentalcomposer
who isnt remembering your bday,Mentalcomposer
its crappy if your parents or sibs forget but any relatives past that is whatever,Mentalcomposer
if its your friends why would they remember your bday,Mentalcomposer
in either case if your bday is important to you i cant imagine why you had not said anything leading up to the week or day,Mentalcomposer
usually something is mentioned about plans that youd like to do for the day,Mentalcomposer
honestly your friend should just leave jane alone,Mentalcomposer
like who just thinks hm which of my friends can i experiment with,Mentalcomposer
why would friend think jane would be receptive to this idea,Mentalcomposer
add to it that shes probably feeling emotionally vulnerable right now not having her sister as her go to,Mentalcomposer
friend is coming off a bit creepy to me  its giving me the ick,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
please explain because i have no idea,Mentalcomposer
even if its court ordered it doesnt mean that they have to come to an agreement right,Mentalcomposer
samantha could just not agree to any kind of settlement and then it goes to court,Mentalcomposer
or can she agree to a settlement and then release any evidence she would have shown at trial that wouldnt be the worst thing but then we wont get to see the m testify,Mentalcomposer
this story gets even weirder,Mentalcomposer
you hunted for 2 hours you got the kids and then went home by when 7pm,Mentalcomposer
did she cancel just so you could come home and she could fight with you over this,Mentalcomposer
did the friend cancel and she thought shed be home all night alone which really is a good thing considering 2 small kids and being pregnant most of us would have been thrilled,Mentalcomposer
somethings off about her reasoning,Mentalcomposer
let this go this time but know you did nothing wrong you tried to do something nice for your wife,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
im not sure im understanding why your wife is upset,Mentalcomposer
she still went out with her friends no so she got a kid free night out unless her friend also has kids and they were going to entertain each other,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that you both got to do something you wanted and the kids got time with the grand parents win win win for everybody,Mentalcomposer
if she has no underlying issue then honestly i dont wouldnt have a problem with messy rooms they have to live with it,Mentalcomposer
i have the king of messy kids the clothes literally are on the floor right next to the laundry basket,Mentalcomposer
dont pick up her clothes and if she doesnt already she should be doing her own laundry  when she runs out of underwear shell figure it out,Mentalcomposer
if she steps on her art supplies and ruins them they wont be replaced until the next gift giving occasion  bday xmas unless she buys it herself,Mentalcomposer
if she cant find something she needs amongst the rubble shell have to plow thru it all to find it,Mentalcomposer
the place i absolutely draw the line is any food stuff,Mentalcomposer
so i would  literally close her door to the mess as long as the boundary becomes absolutely zero food or drink  other than water is allowed in her room,Mentalcomposer
at some point i get life she will realize that being that messy is a gross way to live,Mentalcomposer
as much as h gives lip service to ending  generational pain he just cannot see the harm he is doing to his own kids,Mentalcomposer
his kids are going to grow up with a very angry dad who blames all his woes on anybody else who has zero self esteem and a mom who can think of no one but herself,Mentalcomposer
meanwhile both parents are at least recreational drug users,Mentalcomposer
those things are going to make for two kids who feel unloved by both parents and anxious kids walking on eggshells around their dad at least,Mentalcomposer
they think theyre so enlightened but they have no clue how to raise happy healthy well adjusted kids,Mentalcomposer
its a shame really those kids could have had the best of everything,Mentalcomposer
those are going to be the longest years of your life,Mentalcomposer
maybe a sit down with d and bf is in order there are certain things he just cannot say and do and demand while in your home,Mentalcomposer
you all have to live together and respecting each other is paramount,Mentalcomposer
why exactly is your ds 25 yo bf living with you,Mentalcomposer
are they going to be able to support themselves after they marry or are you going to have to house them too,Mentalcomposer
he needs to go,Mentalcomposer
i love my 20 something kids but if they want to play house they have to do it in their own house  hes been there a year already whats the plan,Mentalcomposer
im not overly thrilled with this age gap not that youre so old but shes too young for you,Mentalcomposer
its 3 months its not some long term thing happening you should break up with her and tell her to go see her school counselor to get some help with whats going on at home and her self harm,Mentalcomposer
you cannot keep dating her because youre afraid shes going to hurt herself she never said that so dont add to the drama,Mentalcomposer
let him keep walking,Mentalcomposer
these are your kids you make the rules if he doesnt like it too bad,Mentalcomposer
do not let your kids see that you are changing the rules because of what he says or does they need to see you standing up for them,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
her son is having some issues enough that his dad travel 5 hours to be there for and her biggest concern is she needs a massage,Mentalcomposer
she needs her priorities straight,Mentalcomposer
leave at the agreed time and if shes not in the car she takes the train home,Mentalcomposer
do not rush into their room the second they make a sound on that stupid baby monitor   of course go in when they are actually crying,Mentalcomposer
why because they will never learn to self soothe themselves back to sleep if you keep going in and bothering them while theyre sleeping,Mentalcomposer
learned the very hard way,Mentalcomposer
i kind of get the feeling h was too weak meek scared idk to actually think about distancing himself from the rf and when he found a woman who was telling him all the ways it was possible he jumped on it she gave him  in his mind plausible reasons to leave and he didnt have to do it all on his own,Mentalcomposer
if he had thoughts of not having the life he was born into  cause his birth did come with an expectation he couldnt even fathom how he could make that a reality but suddenly someone showed him how,Mentalcomposer
that they made a complete and utter mess of it is another story,Mentalcomposer
you might want to post this in r texas,Mentalcomposer
someone who lives there may be able to answer,Mentalcomposer
this forum is for help using reditt,Mentalcomposer
wait tho i thought megans friends initially leaked not the actual letter but a paraphrasing of it to people magazine and then her dad allowed some other publication to see it and they printed a big part of it no,Mentalcomposer
if thats not what happened then what did,Mentalcomposer
no its been 3 months if youre not into her chances are you wont ever be,Mentalcomposer
would you want to be with someone who describes you like you describe being with her  someone who is repulsed by kissing you,Mentalcomposer
let her go now before she gets even more invested in you,Mentalcomposer
and since youre young ill add do not tell her you  dont and never did feel anything for her  just say its not working for you you think shes a great person but not your person,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you need to do two things,Mentalcomposer
get a court order for child support,Mentalcomposer
petition the court to allow you to move out of state for school,Mentalcomposer
he may not be involved now but if you pick up and move are you sure he wont say you kidnapped the child you dont need more problems,Mentalcomposer
your financial situation all stems from giving up any assets in the divorce,Mentalcomposer
if hes such a good guy maybe you should ask him to give you back your half,Mentalcomposer
see what he says if he wants you out thats how it can be done and then you can get the therapy you need,Mentalcomposer
what happened to your well paying job,Mentalcomposer
as for jenna and the friends theyre out of line did you tell ex what they said and why would he have those people over knowing youre in the house he didnt tell you they were coming and he didnt tell them youd be there whats his game,Mentalcomposer
yta    for not giving your h a heads up,Mentalcomposer
i think son is seeing how dad is with the sister and is feeling like dad isnt  doing as much with him now at this age as he is with sister it may just be that dad thinks son doesnt need as much from him and sis does just by virtue of their ages,Mentalcomposer
but it may be bringing up abandonment issues for son his bio dad didnt want anything to do with him and step dad was ok but not as paternal with him so hes not really a son to a dad,Mentalcomposer
is it true we dont know but son has the perception that it is,Mentalcomposer
you said dad went to games played with son etc so you need to figure out why your son all of a sudden feels dad is not dad enough,Mentalcomposer
i think you did your son and your h a disservice by claiming rights to your son so while h did as much as he did he may have stopped himself doing more  because he was afraid hed cross some line with you not with the son he feels is his own,Mentalcomposer
you need to let h know whats going on so the two of them can talk about it your son might actually realize that the dad he wanted was and is actually the dad he got,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
its not unreasonable to ask for quiet at a certain time of night i dont know why that would bother you so much,Mentalcomposer
stomping up the stairs and slamming the door did not just bother james but probably every other resident of the house,Mentalcomposer
taking out the trash is part of contributing to the upkeep of the home you live in if you lived with anyone else or even alone you would have to do some basic chores in the house,Mentalcomposer
i dont know how much of your stuff you had in the lr but if it was becoming unwieldy then yeah everyone else shouldnt have to live around your stuff,Mentalcomposer
im not commenting on the parking bc i really cant even figure out whats going on there,Mentalcomposer
do you think you should just be able to do whatever you want whenever you want when you share a house with others its called respect for your roommates you need to have some,Mentalcomposer
and she remembered that one convo exactly,Mentalcomposer
its a dead giveaway that it didnt happen like that,Mentalcomposer
at least paraphrase it say it went something like,Mentalcomposer
and i thought there was no conflict until they were at the fitting now were supposed to believe there was already a problem before the fitting and that c started it and that charlotte cried as soon as she put it on shes 3 she might not like the idea of trying any dress on but she wasnt crying over the fit of it,Mentalcomposer
if c had the dress at home and it didnt fit wouldnt she just get it altered,Mentalcomposer
oh and of course this whole thing had,Mentalcomposer
meg sobbing on the floor  again,Mentalcomposer
maybe she washes the floor with all the tears she sheds while shes down there multitasking,Mentalcomposer
better to check it out hoping all turns out well,Mentalcomposer
that struck me as odd,Mentalcomposer
like are they sending contracts back and forth in a negotiation,Mentalcomposer
this statement makes zero sense,Mentalcomposer
so i dont think either of the two directly leaked to the press but i do believe they had other people do it,Mentalcomposer
so id like to see a journalist be a real journalist and piece together how the story got to them and that the only way its possible is thru the sussex camp,Mentalcomposer
they probably wont come out and name names but they can infer who the person was and that would only lead back to them,Mentalcomposer
example if it came from scobie they can say something about the book he wrote or being their main mouthpiece or something,Mentalcomposer
it wont shut h up about leaks but he again will be shown to be the ass that he is for spouting off crap he doesnt have a clue about,Mentalcomposer
youre going to have to describe this painting a bit more,Mentalcomposer
there must be something about it he finds offensive or maybe he just thinks its ugly,Mentalcomposer
but is it just that shes not following the religion,Mentalcomposer
or is it more likely that hes pointing out that she doesnt have to be religious but she shouldnt be mocking his religion in his own home,Mentalcomposer
if she didnt want to pray she should have done the adult thing and respectfully decline not make a mockery of it,Mentalcomposer
the bf didnt even blink and was willing to pray probably,Mentalcomposer
out of respect that these are his gfs parents and we dont know if he is religious or not,Mentalcomposer
d is flouting her independence which 19 yos will do and dad isnt happy about how shes going about it,Mentalcomposer
that needs to be a conversation where dad recognizes her as an adult and d equally acts like an adult,Mentalcomposer
her praying to her god bf should have been pretty cringy to everyone bf included hes old enough to recognize the immaturity of his gf he whispered to her probably to tell her to apologize i wonder if he had anything to say to her when they got home,Mentalcomposer
and thats your fault how exactly,Mentalcomposer
pretty sure he deals with this idk every year does he become unbearable to everyone or just you,Mentalcomposer
anyway nta,Mentalcomposer
so now youre already weak and cant drive im going to assume tomorrow wont be any better because you dont have the meds you need to keep you stronger so is he gonna get them tomorrow or do you just wait for winter when it cools down a bit,Mentalcomposer
hes not really a good partner if these meds are a life long thing how can you trust hell take care of you in the future or if your condition gets worse,Mentalcomposer
i was thinking you were talking about booking thru dvc because you referenced the 11 month mark which is when as a dvc you can start booking,Mentalcomposer
if you werent then disregard most everything i wrote because it will not apply,Mentalcomposer
i havent made a cash stay at disney but if the booking window only opens at the 11 mo mark then the advice to be ready at exactly that day and even as close to the hour as possible would still apply,Mentalcomposer
sorry if i confused you,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused,Mentalcomposer
they want to figure out why so many others of their own party  but really its jan 6 ppl and trump are being investigated as opposed to what,Mentalcomposer
just sweeping it under the rug and not investigating or are they saying these are not legitimate investigations and are more being done based on party politics,Mentalcomposer
if you break the law you get investigated and probably usually maybe charged,Mentalcomposer
im getting a little sick of congress investigating anything they investigate while ongoing investigations are being done by other law enforcement agencies its just redundantif i was an innocent witness id be overwhelmed being grilled by le and congress,Mentalcomposer
as long as you have enough home points at either or both resorts you should absolutely be ready to book at the exact hour at the 11 mo mark,Mentalcomposer
check to make sure but im pretty sure you cant combine your poly and wl points to use at either resort at 11 mo youd have to use for instance your poly points at poly at 11 mo and then add to the res using your wl points at the 7 mo mark because one of them isnt your home resort at the other resort i hope that makes sense,Mentalcomposer
keep in mind if youre looking around at 2023 summer availability to get an idea of how it is its already past the 11 mo and close to the 7 mo mark so you wont get an adequate comparison,Mentalcomposer
if youre looking at 11 mo out availability just to see what it looks like in 2023 its not a good comparison because its a diff month and season if im doing it right that puts you in late nov early dec which is prime time,Mentalcomposer
what change exactly are they fighting for,Mentalcomposer
do they think just because they are an interracial couple they can eradicate racism by what just being a couple,Mentalcomposer
if it was that easy it would have been gone decades ago,Mentalcomposer
exactly what injustice has been done to them megan got some bad press well welcome to the world of a public figure it happens to any and everyone who has a public profile,Mentalcomposer
these two think that just because they want  to be seen as doing no wrong no one is allowed to call them out when they do wrong,Mentalcomposer
anybody else just getting bored of the whole thing i come here to keep up but its just a never ending circle jerk,Mentalcomposer
and if no one reported on them theyd just do something even more outrageous to be back in the news and start the whole cycle over again,Mentalcomposer
yes i realize how that sounds as im commenting on them but its just all so absurd,Mentalcomposer
these two are so dramatic,Mentalcomposer
any visit they would have in the uk for any royal engagement theyd take a private plane  cause they could never fly commercial and be driven to whatever royal house theyd be staying at their security guard they already employ could travel with them,Mentalcomposer
once there they have regular security  for the house compound grounds etc thats already in place anyway,Mentalcomposer
then when they have to get to the engagement theyd be traveling with all of the rest of the family that would have security,Mentalcomposer
there is literally no way anyone could get to them not that anyones coming,Mentalcomposer
they really think theyre all that huh,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
its time you sit your mom down and lay out some facts that she either gets on board with or she doesnt come,Mentalcomposer
these people have done nothing wrong and have actually been good to you i think its great that you can have at least some of her dads fam in her life,Mentalcomposer
tell your mom that going forward its joint everything and that includes your fil  she doesnt have to like everyone that you choose to be friends with but she sure has to respect your relationships with them,Mentalcomposer
her crying over this stuff is so over the top its childish the longer you allow it to go on the worse it will get,Mentalcomposer
7 months on and off  this is not a relationship thats going well no,Mentalcomposer
cut your losses now shes gonna find something else to fly off the handle for and youll be equally as baffled as this time,Mentalcomposer
and her following you is odd she was probably worried you were snooping in her room because you were taking longer than usual because of the spill which then also explains why she sent you out and she stayed behind to make sure everything was in its place,Mentalcomposer
do you want someone who doesnt trust you,Mentalcomposer
why are we even discussing kc paying her off,Mentalcomposer
he owes her nothing not even ransom to get his son back,Mentalcomposer
if h suddenly decides he needs out then he can go thru the divorce court on his own and they can fight it out,Mentalcomposer
so basically h just refuses to listen to any criticism of anything his bro and dad say about m megxit and bullying,Mentalcomposer
but when the bro and dad refuse to listen to his counter argument theyre in the wrong,Mentalcomposer
he just refuses to believe that she can be anything but an angel and thats why hes in the position hes in,Mentalcomposer
the 25 page bullying rebuttal is probably filled with excuses shes american she didnt know thats not how she does things shes direct not rude etc,Mentalcomposer
but it doesnt matter she joined a family that has rules regulations and a way things are done you cant come in and expect them to change for you and thats what they wanted they wanted to modernizean institution that doesnt need modernizing because to the witch that means making the brf a money making merchandiser,Mentalcomposer
and once again this is why the fam doesnt want to talk to him because there is nothing private,Mentalcomposer
im gonna be brutally honest with you,Mentalcomposer
you willingly got into a relationship with a man who cheats and leaves every relationship hes ever had and to placate him you decide to have an open relationship which really in this situation is just you agreeing to let him cheat,Mentalcomposer
how exactly did you think this was not going to end any other way than with him leaving you,Mentalcomposer
did you think as long as he was having sex with other women he would always come back to you,Mentalcomposer
why would you want a life of sharing the person you love with multiple others,Mentalcomposer
and the worst part  you brought your then 9 year old  at the time who grew up in this situation along for the ride,Mentalcomposer
think about what youve been modeling to your d,Mentalcomposer
do you want her to hitch herself to men who cheat and leave,Mentalcomposer
or do you want to model a monogamous loving relationship which is what you should be striving for,Mentalcomposer
you know what you have to do find some self respect and leave his sorry ass stand up for yourself and show your d now while shes just starting to figure out relationships what she should and shouldnt be accepting from a partner,Mentalcomposer
whats wrong with his health,Mentalcomposer
i havent heard of anything,Mentalcomposer
everyone already thinks andrew is  scum so writing unflattering stories of andrew insulting or upsetting either one of them isnt going to elicit any sympathy for hm,Mentalcomposer
or andrew knows way too much about her past antics,Mentalcomposer
or hes not high enough on the pecking order knocking him down a peg or two isnt gonna elevate h to king,Mentalcomposer
or he needs to stay in beatrices good graces to get the inside scoop,Mentalcomposer
or most probable andrew just doesnt care enough to have any dealings with the lunatic fringe of the family he saw the train wreck coming and noped out,Mentalcomposer
seriously tho where did he get the hair,Mentalcomposer
did he cut it off her head in the coffin,Mentalcomposer
did she give it to him after a haircut,Mentalcomposer
and why would he even want it,Mentalcomposer
did he need it to make a witches potion,Mentalcomposer
im so baffled by this hair in a box,Mentalcomposer
yta a massive massive one,Mentalcomposer
there is no excuse for a 7 yo to smear lipstick all over anything,Mentalcomposer
your d showed great restraint in only yelling at the little brat,Mentalcomposer
the one who should be punished is layla she has been told repeatedly to leave your ds stuff alone and she keeps repeating the offense with no consequence,Mentalcomposer
you cannot expect your d to lock up everything she owns every single day and night in her own room that you moved her ss into because you wanted to marry her mother stop bending over backward to placate your wife and her kids thats ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with you how did you ever parent your own kids since it seems youre clueless,Mentalcomposer
give your d back her phone buy her a new dress and punish the 7 year old,Mentalcomposer
stop making your 16 yo teach the 7 yo what her mother should be teaching her,Mentalcomposer
oh and of course your wife thinks the punishment is fine her little angel of a,Mentalcomposer
d should never be made to cry,Mentalcomposer
be a better parent to your d,Mentalcomposer
come on man you went to the best schools from the age of 3 are we to believe that you never ever had a lesson on hitler and the nazis,Mentalcomposer
does he really expect us to believe that he had absolutely zero idea that costume was not just offensive but its one of those absolutely do not do things,Mentalcomposer
the fam def paid way too much for his education,Mentalcomposer
at this point the longest or shortest  idc serving independent,Mentalcomposer
enough with d and r,Mentalcomposer
it stops the circus thats happening now,Mentalcomposer
i think willy and harold are honestly just snarky nicknames that had for each other as kids,Mentalcomposer
i could see harry calling him willy as in dick and w calling him harold because its like an old man name,Mentalcomposer
theyre were just making fun of each other as kids,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i agree it wasnt your secret to tell,Mentalcomposer
your wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it she will change her ways this is a good thing,Mentalcomposer
she should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldnt tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her,Mentalcomposer
this could turn out to be a good thing,Mentalcomposer
nono you got it all wrong,Mentalcomposer
megsie was the one wronged by all members of the family the media her ex husband her ex bfs her dad her siblings in all things ever,Mentalcomposer
they all caused the strife that was blamed on her,Mentalcomposer
and shell keep saying it until we all agree with her,Mentalcomposer
good point youre right they probably laid it all out for him,Mentalcomposer
and leaving out the details is what makes him look like a whining child,Mentalcomposer
im sure c had a legit reason for not wanting m there and even if its that he wanted just immediate family,Mentalcomposer
h cant say what that reason he was given because it would make him look bad to argue about it so he leaves it out thinking it will make c look like the bad guy but of course that would never happen because c can dictate whatever the hell he wants in regards to his mothers death,Mentalcomposer
whats meant by this,Mentalcomposer
its not hard to see why prince harry and meghan markle decided to leave england amid all this drama and tension and we havent even gotten into harry and williams physical fightwhich you can read about in detail below,Mentalcomposer
the drama and tension was started by harry and megan with their over entitlement with their feelings of superiority their jealousy of every other working royal,Mentalcomposer
dont want drama and tension dont start it,Mentalcomposer
you need to keep working on your jealousy issues or they will come into play and ruin every other relationship you will have in the future,Mentalcomposer
take your jealousy issue as the lesson you learned from this relationship and use that thought as motivation to move on and be thankful that this happened at a young age instead of having a string of failed relationships,Mentalcomposer
in the future i would advise that you not spend all your time with a partner its not healthy for anyone,Mentalcomposer
its not sustainable in the long run,Mentalcomposer
its not that you cant move in because youre so stuck on this o e girl its that you have no idea what to do with the time you normally spent with her,Mentalcomposer
find a hobby read a book do a puzzle anything so you dont just sit like a lump on a log and pine away for someone that doesnt want to be with you,Mentalcomposer
after the book if theres more vague crap the palace can legitimately make a statement saying something to the affect that,Mentalcomposer
even though the k will always have a fathers love for a son its become quite obvious that h  m are doing their level best to distance themselves from the family for the celebration of the coronation the k has decided that he will adhere to their want of distance,Mentalcomposer
idk something diplomatic without coming out and saying no one wants them here,Mentalcomposer
no one is ever going to think it has anything to do with race that horse is dead beaten dug up beat some more and reburied,Mentalcomposer
most telling to me is this passage,Mentalcomposer
harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare,Mentalcomposer
this is the crux of h he admits it,Mentalcomposer
all of his moaning and it all comes down to the fact that he isnt going to be king,Mentalcomposer
too bad so sad 30 years and he still hasnt come to terms with it,Mentalcomposer
i think being a global icon is her goal,Mentalcomposer
she thought she hit the jackpot when she bagged the dimwit she really thought that overnight her name would be recognizable to everyone and every possible door to fame and fortune would be opened for her,Mentalcomposer
so basically she thought shed be an icon for basically getting married,Mentalcomposer
in reality shes half of a couple with a victim complex who people are sick of hearing from and about,Mentalcomposer
i think an invictus show would have been interesting to watch,Mentalcomposer
if and only if,Mentalcomposer
h was actually working with an organization to benefit and help veterans if he did that and it got even minimal press i think ppl would tune in,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that he hosts the games and then disappears theres zero follow up on the athletes the help they get nothing,Mentalcomposer
idk anything about invictus are they an organization that puts these games on do companies sponsor the games is it a money making endeavor what do the athletes get out of competing in these games,Mentalcomposer
i thought i saw somewhere that somehow the rf was instrumental in starting it,Mentalcomposer
these are the answers i would have liked to see answered from a docu of the games,Mentalcomposer
if its just disabled vets competing in sports then what sets them apart from the para olympics  i guess theres something to be said for it being all vets,Mentalcomposer
so many arguments can be avoided if we just talk to each other,Mentalcomposer
everyone in my house knows when im going into the kitchen to cook did you not know she was  in the kitchen making supper,Mentalcomposer
did you not go in and ask what shes cooking  was supper supposed to be a surprise  notice you didnt mention or even suggest having something hot since they were out in the cold all day,Mentalcomposer
was she tired from being out doing an activity all day and just wanted to make something quick and easy quite possible or she planned that meal before they went skating and already had the ingredients,Mentalcomposer
this is so petty by both of you,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt have made a face and she shouldnt be mad that you wanted to eat something else that you went and made,Mentalcomposer
that is exactly what i said,Mentalcomposer
those kinds of opp sex relationships are the only ones that are acceptable,Mentalcomposer
to cut contact with,Mentalcomposer
im not sure how unpopular this really is,Mentalcomposer
if you cut contact with one or two of the opposite sex for an actual reason like theyre youre sexting partners who you dont have an irl friendship with then maybe its not a bad idea if its your decision,Mentalcomposer
but cutting all contact just because is ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
even more cringy is your new partner demanding that you cut contact with anyone of the opposite sex cant even like someones picture or make a comment  those people need a huge dose of reality but i think these cases are more a result of immaturity,Mentalcomposer
nope one hit and im out,Mentalcomposer
i dont care what you said to him,Mentalcomposer
it really is that simple,Mentalcomposer
i could see him saying he had no idea what was going to happen at the coronation and that he had no choice but to say those words since he was put on the spot,Mentalcomposer
hell use the excuse that since nobody is talking to him they didnt explain what was going to happen at the coronation he just showed up thinking it would be like a church service or something,Mentalcomposer
could you just imagine the stupidly is endless,Mentalcomposer
i agree with checking but then why would the h not be experiencing any issues its only her,Mentalcomposer
if he goes out of the house to work and she stays home could it affect her that much more i dont really know,Mentalcomposer
honestly its not that hard to poke your head into whatever room theyre in to say hello when you get to your bf house you dont have to roam the house to find both of them but if theyre in the living room or kitchen its not that hard to do,Mentalcomposer
my kids so do that every time and then they go to their room,Mentalcomposer
the dog incident you should have had a lighthearted comment about it  would have been nice to know before she eats my hand or something,Mentalcomposer
did you say hi to his mom at work or were you waiting for her to engage you if youre still at work go over and say something anything start the conversation maybe say you bf told you why shes annoyed and apologize tell her youll do better from now on,Mentalcomposer
this should blow over but going forward make sure you say hello its just common courtesy,Mentalcomposer
and please dont stay over so much even if you dont think it it does disrupt the flow of the house,Mentalcomposer
i see where youre coming from i really do and could understand where many people would have the same outlook as you,Mentalcomposer
but the royal family is not a govt its not a political body they have no legislative power,Mentalcomposer
they are however a focus of national identity and pride with a huge focus on service it is a thousands year old tradition that i would say has changed with the times as they are no longer the rulers of nations,Mentalcomposer
now if harry wants changes to the brf or the monarchy i have not seen one example of what he wants to change,Mentalcomposer
have you because if he did i missed it,Mentalcomposer
being a rebellious teen is nothing new but its a far cry from airing every perceived slight you have ever had in your life,Mentalcomposer
and again what terrible attacks has megan be subjected to,Mentalcomposer
the paper that printed the compton thing was chastised for it,Mentalcomposer
the tiara issue is in line with protecting the actual royal jewels,Mentalcomposer
the issue of who made who cry happened it wasnt some made up story someone let it slip but m and kate werent the only ones there something happened and neither you or me know the real story,Mentalcomposer
the fact that m cut off her whole family is true its human nature to want to know why and the media is right in trying to delve into why she was a very popular person at the time and most people thought it was a horrible thing for her as in what could they have possibly done to her for her to take so drastic a measure,Mentalcomposer
on the flip side there is no video evidence that they are or were being relentlessly pursued by paparazzi which they claim,Mentalcomposer
there is no verifiable info that anyone said or made any racist overtures to her which they claim,Mentalcomposer
according to them the proposal could be two diff times,Mentalcomposer
they were married 3 days earlier  proven lie  they didnt help with the finding freedom book thats a proven lie  there were leaks i agree im just not convinced every single one of them were coming from the palace so what benefit could mh have for leaking some themselves hmm,Mentalcomposer
theres just a lot i mean a lot of discrepancies when they come out with their stories some probably have a grain of truth but the embellishment goes way beyond,Mentalcomposer
well agree to disagree and do it in a polite civilized way and thats a good thing,Mentalcomposer
ok im gonna say this not to be mean but just as a thought since you havent given us much insight to your actual level of commitment,Mentalcomposer
you were dating 3 months which isnt very long,Mentalcomposer
hes been gone for most of your relationship,Mentalcomposer
you two have barely spent any of these 11 months together  if you even saw him at all since his deployment,Mentalcomposer
im thinking he may not be thinking this is as serious as you,Mentalcomposer
time alone is not a good judge of the seriousness of a relationship especially when you are apart,Mentalcomposer
do i think he likes you sure he does but not enough to rework his whole life around you,Mentalcomposer
but is he sitting in his bunk pining away for you maybe not,Mentalcomposer
sorry again not trying to be mean,Mentalcomposer
were you dating before he went in,Mentalcomposer
how long were you dating before he got deployed,Mentalcomposer
thank you for the award,Mentalcomposer
heres my take on all this,Mentalcomposer
id point out that these arent 2 young people,Mentalcomposer
even when they met he was 32 and she was 34 hardly the age of naive change the world attitude,Mentalcomposer
both of them have years of life experience and know the ways of the world,Mentalcomposer
and hes been in this family has known exactly how it was run and worked and i dont ever recall him speaking out previous to megan about any toxicity,Mentalcomposer
note he could have i wasnt and still not obsessed with everything royal,Mentalcomposer
they lieproven they implynever a definitive explanation of this person said i said they never show any proof of the so called leaks or planted stories racist behavior or snub by anyone,Mentalcomposer
makes it kind of hard to believe what they say and a lot of it is just so freakin silly and stupid stuff that if it happened in your real life youd be thinking why are we even having this conversation,Mentalcomposer
its tiresome at this point 3 years since they left theyre not going to change the way the monarchy works its not their job it was never their job,Mentalcomposer
i dont know why they ever thought it was,Mentalcomposer
add to this their idea that they were going to be advocates of climate issues humanitarian issues womans issues whatever else and they have done exactly zero on any of these fronts,Mentalcomposer
they have literally not done anything but whine and complain and collect awards they did not earn,Mentalcomposer
thats why people dont like them not because of some fan girling of the royal family,Mentalcomposer
so he drops the idea that the family or the palace planted stories when there was some kind of conflict,Mentalcomposer
ok then,Mentalcomposer
you would think any journalist with any journalistic integritys next question would be,Mentalcomposer
what was the conflict about and what story was planted can you give me an example,Mentalcomposer
but of course it never gets asked and were back to again accusations with absolutely zero evidence to back it up,Mentalcomposer
and this is exactly why i do not believe a word they say,Mentalcomposer
i believe there were conflicts either between members of the fam or even the palace bc thats just the nature of relationships at some point but i truly think the two of them wanted something wanted to do something or go somewhere and they were rebuffed for whatever reason,Mentalcomposer
so true to form for egotistical people they went immediately to a conspiracy against them instead of like a normal person trying to find a way to compromise and make it work,Mentalcomposer
and there were no leaked stories these two did something while out and about and the press wrote about,Mentalcomposer
it whatever it was showed them in not the best light but instead of realizing they shouldnt have done that or said that they jump right to it must be a leak or a plant,Mentalcomposer
these two are so delusional it defies any sense of rationale,Mentalcomposer
a couple things stood out as i read,Mentalcomposer
since the ultimate goal is for him to get his own apt hes essentially moving into your apt temporarily  in that case i think he could make it a point to just not put meat or fish in the refig,Mentalcomposer
will it be a pain sometimes yes it will but its your apt he can eat meat when you two go out or pick up something from fast food on occasion or if he really gets an urge for a steak on a random day he can pick 1 steak note 1 on the way home from work and cook it or he can get 1 burger from the butcher in the grocery store basically just enough for him to eat that one meal at home,Mentalcomposer
yes its not as convenient as having these all in the freezer but it is what it is,Mentalcomposer
it will work as long as he fully agrees to all of this with out moaning about it and you need to have this convo now not in the spring he needs to know this is a non negotiable and agree to it,Mentalcomposer
and then once he gets his own apt you have to be ok with him having meat in his refrigerator or freezer,Mentalcomposer
id also have him buy his own pans to cook any meat in just for your comfort if you need that,Mentalcomposer
also keep in mind it might take him a while to actually find a job in his field does he have a plan b in case that doesnt happen,Mentalcomposer
oh i dont either but i was thinking thats the incident  op was referencing,Mentalcomposer
so if he insinuated william cheated,Mentalcomposer
do we think william will need to make some sort of statement or,Mentalcomposer
do we think itll be written off as just another lie,Mentalcomposer
if he insinuated william didnt marry for love and there was another he wanted instead was there even ever another steady long term girlfriend that he dated who would believe that,Mentalcomposer
no way i believe william made any racist remark about what the baby would look like i dont know many men who would even think about it seems more like something women would chat about in a nice way,Mentalcomposer
ah thank you  some kind of id makes so much sense,Mentalcomposer
id guess that when the ada for service animals came out there probably werent as many people faking and im sure way less people needing esas so it probably wasnt seen as needed because at the time who would ever question such a thing,Mentalcomposer
i thought you werent allowed to ask what service is being done but i didnt even know there were any papers that can be shown so i learned something thanks for that info,Mentalcomposer
isnt it true that there are no papers that show an animal is a service animal so anyone with a pet can claim whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
so the problem is theres no legal way to ensure that a service animal is actually one and thats why emotional support animals are being seen everywhere,Mentalcomposer
in my opinion a true service dog needs to have some kind of official papers that should need to be shown upon request to allow the animal into places that pets normally arent,Mentalcomposer
i dont think that anyone who actually needs a service animal would be put off having to show that it is an actual service animal,Mentalcomposer
anyone who could find fault with something i do every single day is not someone id want to be with,Mentalcomposer
does he never mess up i bet he does but you dont point it out and rag on him for it,Mentalcomposer
you both have some issues youre not dealing with and if you want this or any other relationship to work youre both going to have to get help to get to a point that youre both mentally stable   you dont mention having any therapy but you both should be seeing someone,Mentalcomposer
idk what you mean about getting a huge boost about rejecting men,Mentalcomposer
but doesnt it make sense that one can be wanting to find a partner but isnt willing to be with just anyone who happens to be male  or female it goes both ways,Mentalcomposer
everyone is only going to date people they are attracted to if they dont meet anyone who they like then why date them,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your wife saying that you shouldnt teach your kids to act a certain way so people will like them is correct,Mentalcomposer
but thats not what youre doing in this instance you arent fundamentally changing who your d is youre pointing out that lateness when boiled down is really about not valuing the person you are meeting and that friends will want to be valued and not made to seem like their time isnt important,Mentalcomposer
you wouldnt ask your d to change her clothes hair hobbies or opinions to fit in those are the things that make your d who she is youre just making her see that other peoples time is as important as hers,Mentalcomposer
try explaining it that way to your wife,Mentalcomposer
listen to your mom,Mentalcomposer
we always discount her opinion but ultimately they are right,Mentalcomposer
she knows what she sees shes been thru it with your sisters,Mentalcomposer
this relationship is just not working,Mentalcomposer
its time to let it go for both of your sakes,Mentalcomposer
it will be tough for a few months but youll get over him and be fine,Mentalcomposer
yeah shes being stupid,Mentalcomposer
maybe she enjoys the danger of it maybe she thinks is exciting,Mentalcomposer
whatever it is you warned her,Mentalcomposer
shell be crying soon because he dumps her and she caught feelings,Mentalcomposer
or shell be crying when she realizes hes just using her for sex,Mentalcomposer
either way its gonna be ugly,Mentalcomposer
how does she know its really open,Mentalcomposer
if she wants to continue with this guy she should ask to speak to his wife to make sure it is really an open marriage,Mentalcomposer
in any event why does she want to expend any energy on a man who is taken,Mentalcomposer
why would you not immediately turn around and go home when he told you he was homeless was he homeless with his 2 kids that live with him,Mentalcomposer
like where did he think you were going to sleep he had no car and 6 kids,Mentalcomposer
raise this baby alone he is useless,Mentalcomposer
he cant even support himself how do you think hes going to support you  you do not need the kind of support he is offering,Mentalcomposer
you seemed to be doing ok before you blew all your money on him,Mentalcomposer
plus his kids are a mess,Mentalcomposer
you will literally be moving into a nightmare,Mentalcomposer
please dont do that to yourself and your child,Mentalcomposer
i have to know the trip to england that you described was that the only time you met him and was that when you got pregnant,Mentalcomposer
omg that sounds like pure hell,Mentalcomposer
you have my sympathy,Mentalcomposer
youve got a few months till easter really work on hubby to get him on board with a schedule that doesnt,Mentalcomposer
have you running all the time,Mentalcomposer
when you want to talk about your struggles without her trying to fix it you need to tell her youre not looking for advice but to just open up to her because you trust her with these things and so she can understand where youre coming from,Mentalcomposer
as far as her opening up maybe she doesnt really have anything to open up about not everyone has or had struggles that they need or want to talk about or maybe she just doesnt want to burden you with her stuff being aware that you have enough going on and doesnt want you dwelling on her crap too,Mentalcomposer
you can always go direct with her and tell her you want to develop a more intimate emotional connection and see what she says,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year,Mentalcomposer
decide on easter thanksgiving and both xmas days thats four so its easy to split them between the 2 families,Mentalcomposer
dont let him railroad you hold your ground if his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house,Mentalcomposer
once you two have come to a decision then you have him tell his mom what the plan going forward is,Mentalcomposer
as an aside i dont know if xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for and to add yet another wrench into the mix you might want to do xmas day at home so your kids dont have to leave their toys every xmas thats the one thing my h always said sucked,Mentalcomposer
as for this nye there would be no way in hell i would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party thats insane send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son they will survive not seeing you for a few hours,Mentalcomposer
just have kate send you your own invitation then youll be invited on your own not included on your dad and sms invite,Mentalcomposer
then find another single fam member and share a room with them to cut your costs,Mentalcomposer
you dont think they want you to stay home to watch the 3 yo do you,Mentalcomposer
thats a big fat no,Mentalcomposer
eatontown has the most retched people on the planet,Mentalcomposer
i put all the docs i needed on the counter spread out so she could see every one of them,Mentalcomposer
that stupid miserable human wouldnt pick my document off the counter i had to pick them up and hand them to her one at a time,Mentalcomposer
havent been back since ill go to hazlet much more civilized there,Mentalcomposer
but the inspection people are very nice especially the woman who works there,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but your bf and cousin sure are,Mentalcomposer
what was he thinking he doesnt even know these people and he says crap like that,Mentalcomposer
your bf is disgusting why would you still want to date him,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
if you cant handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college,Mentalcomposer
its past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own,Mentalcomposer
try an audiobook,Mentalcomposer
i also like to scan the radio to see what kind of music is played in diff parts of the country,Mentalcomposer
how old,Mentalcomposer
and have you never spent any time with these kids before,Mentalcomposer
are they always a bit rambunctious or is it maybe being off of school and holidays and their schedules being out of wack have them a bit crazier than normal,Mentalcomposer
you need to decide if you want to be with your bf bad enough to actually try to have a relationship with his kids actually if youre married youre already a step parent doesnt mean its all on you but you cant just ditch out whenever he has them thats a shitty thing to do they wont always be small and by the time they are old enough they wont want anything to do with you,Mentalcomposer
so i kind of agree with you but just because i dont like oranges,Mentalcomposer
and im not a fan of mixed fruit salad theres always one fruit that gets mushy and then its mixed in with the other still good fruit,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
ok yeah his reactions are sketchy,Mentalcomposer
can you ask for a family meeting just to clear the air a bit obviously you dont want to live with any tension in the house you want your mom to be happy but this whole situation is out of left field,Mentalcomposer
other than that im out of ideas,Mentalcomposer
since youre getting nowhere with your mom have you tried talking to him,Mentalcomposer
just at least to get a sense of him,Mentalcomposer
if hes a decent person hell understand if you preface with something like this is all new and odd to me having my mom move a guy in so can we just have a chat about whats going on here considering i didnt even know you two were having this ldr,Mentalcomposer
like what kind of job did he have maybe hes early retired and actually has some money or it could be he never had much of a career which is a red flag,Mentalcomposer
how olds the d does she live with the mom is he planning on keeping up visits is he responsible at least to his d,Mentalcomposer
does he have family siblings and does he get along with them,Mentalcomposer
then after a bit you can ask if he has any plan to get his own apt and job you know sort of just live in the same city and date you never really know a person just from online talking he might realize he doesnt actually like your mom,Mentalcomposer
cant hurt to try he might not even want to talk to you which would be weird or he may be fine with your obvious inquiry as to whats going on,Mentalcomposer
its def a strange turn of events in your moms part,Mentalcomposer
okra,Mentalcomposer
i tried to expand my veggie eating but okra was just gross,Mentalcomposer
thank you,Mentalcomposer
is he planning on getting a job at some point his own apt,Mentalcomposer
for arguments sake lets say your mom and him really like each other fine his lease is up so they decide to have him move closer so they can date,Mentalcomposer
this is all ok as long as he stays with her but only until he can get a job apt and support himself,Mentalcomposer
if this is whats going on id say its crappy that she just sprung him on you did you even know she was talking to this guy,Mentalcomposer
like did she mention it at all,Mentalcomposer
what a wonderful find,Mentalcomposer
for my bridal shower my mom gave me a set of embroidered pillow cases that my grandma made for me,Mentalcomposer
i had no idea they existed it was a really nice sentimental surprise she had been gone for a while by then,Mentalcomposer
oh and its been 33 years and i never used them idk why not i think i just wanted them to stay nice,Mentalcomposer
are you saying you are seeing something diff,Mentalcomposer
if so id like to hear yours please,Mentalcomposer
i dont know anything about how tarot works but it would be interesting to see what differs,Mentalcomposer
while i agree she had to learn it somewhere but im not convinced its from her dad,Mentalcomposer
she seemed to have a regular upbringing by her dad albeit one where she was spoiled which would give her an inflated opinion of herself,Mentalcomposer
but once she decided to act is where i think she got the transactional idea,Mentalcomposer
i would think it happens a lot in hollywood you do this for me i do this for you,Mentalcomposer
it started with trevor,Mentalcomposer
i absolutely think she married trevor for that transactional relationship what he can do for her career and all she had to do in return was be with him when she had no use for him anymore he was discarded,Mentalcomposer
then it carried into everyone else she seemed to be friendswith,Mentalcomposer
sophie markus corey,Mentalcomposer
in every one of these relationships she was trying to do something that these people all were somewhat related to,Mentalcomposer
sophie and markus for highbrow connections,Mentalcomposer
corey when she wanted to be a food blogger or whatever the heck she was trying to do,Mentalcomposer
so with h it was a case of this person has intl recognition is widely thought of as a decent person concerned with the environment and veterans and i want that too,Mentalcomposer
just a thought,Mentalcomposer
i think its a matter of access,Mentalcomposer
if you always brought a person  into the fold  they can be family based,Mentalcomposer
on the person  bringing them in,Mentalcomposer
my adult kids  have brought people around sporadically  but if i know my kid is invested  in this relationship i treat them as one of the fam,Mentalcomposer
thats what you do you bring them in based on your child,Mentalcomposer
but i welcome everyone,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
its not like he helps with anything else involving your apt so why would he think hed have to help with your nephews,Mentalcomposer
seriously hes nothing but a mooch,Mentalcomposer
all he pays for his his car and insurance  so basically just his stuff,Mentalcomposer
why are you allowing him to freeload off of you,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i dont even know why there was any awkwardness,Mentalcomposer
wife had friends over husband leaves to give the girls time to hang out,Mentalcomposer
now if you told your wife in front of jamie that you didnt want her there then it would be awkward but im assuming that didnt happen because based on the rest of the post jamie would have started something,Mentalcomposer
your wife really needs to start standing up to jamie tho the part about you and w not taking someone elses grief seriously is just so out of line and your wifes voice raising thing is something you would think jamie would know by now,Mentalcomposer
how old is the brother,Mentalcomposer
does your bf hang out with him on his own,Mentalcomposer
if hes a bunch younger than you guys he might not want to hang out with  old ppl  not that youre old but to him maybe,Mentalcomposer
if hes closer in age then its up to your bf to plan a get together so you two can get to know each other better,Mentalcomposer
either way i say just go be nice,Mentalcomposer
dont try to force a connection if its not there,Mentalcomposer
i just dont understand why this wasnt a conversation,Mentalcomposer
does he frequently make plans that youre not invited to,Mentalcomposer
why cant you and d go  brother is married so its not a boys thing,Mentalcomposer
especially that hes gone for nye since we were dating weve always spent nye together,Mentalcomposer
i dont like your h at all,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
you are already committed to be groomsman in the friends wedding,Mentalcomposer
thats a perfectly viable reason to miss the cousins wedding,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but the second you walked in and saw the other dogs your h should have been the one to ask him mom what the deal was,Mentalcomposer
not you him,Mentalcomposer
its now days later you and h are upset at her shes probably pissed because she didnt see her son again and is of course blaming you and the fact that she lied to you about no dogs coming this year has still not been addressed,Mentalcomposer
its not gonna get better no matter what you do but h should be pointing out any snubs or nastiness from his mom every single time,Mentalcomposer
i agree on the counseling,Mentalcomposer
at this point your normal is explosive arguing and neither of you have any idea how to get out of this cycle,Mentalcomposer
but also as an idea think back to your last argument that spiraled out of control and dissect it from beginning to end try to recall exactly what was said and by who,Mentalcomposer
do this just for yourself not to find who was to blame but to try to see where the disagreement went off the rails,Mentalcomposer
its always a good idea to have some kind of understanding of how things turn bad,Mentalcomposer
again not to place blame but to analyze  what the dynamic is like between the two of you and if you could have a do over what would you have said instead that may have changed the course of the argument,Mentalcomposer
a sort of self reflection,Mentalcomposer
he knows but she doesnt,Mentalcomposer
its not like hes leaking this crap,Mentalcomposer
he has no idea half the time what shes orchestrating,Mentalcomposer
that doesnt absolve him of going along with all of it after the fact tho,Mentalcomposer
and ill bet once he figures out that its her she admits it but whats he gonna do he cant contradict her once its out there so he has to play the game her game,Mentalcomposer
i agree,Mentalcomposer
there is no way back for them,Mentalcomposer
he might be brought back but not to the life he had,Mentalcomposer
hell be treated like andrew living a life far away from any royal duties he may be invited to select things like xmas church service but thats it,Mentalcomposer
well see him sporadically riding a horse or something,Mentalcomposer
im not even sure if the fam will let the kids back if she gets unsupervised visits h cant be anywhere near her alone once  if hes free of her grasp,Mentalcomposer
too much risk that hell say something that shell exploit,Mentalcomposer
just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing unless she is competing in either sport,Mentalcomposer
neither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue,Mentalcomposer
she already knows how to ride and climb after that its just for practice,Mentalcomposer
plus i think learning sign language is awesome,Mentalcomposer
you have got to be kidding with this,Mentalcomposer
your bf wants nothing more to do with you youre a cheater,Mentalcomposer
leave him alone you cant get him back you dont deserve him,Mentalcomposer
i couldnt read the article so sorry if this was in it,Mentalcomposer
it might be effective depending on what happens when you test positive if youre quarantined until you test negative then maybe it will be effective,Mentalcomposer
i think the bigger issue is since china isnt very forthcoming with any data they may have variants caused by mutations that the rest of the world hasnt even seen yet,Mentalcomposer
my biggest worry is a variant that is more dangerous that starts to spread well be back to the exact place we were at the beginning,Mentalcomposer
this is less about you and your sister and more about what your parents should be saying to your sister,Mentalcomposer
they need to get her petty jealousy under control,Mentalcomposer
she made her choice of schools and you made yours it isnt as if your parents denied her the choice they need to explain that to her and tell her to knock off the rivalry,Mentalcomposer
your mom cant stay neutral when this is affecting the whole household and you dad needs to do more than just be pissed at sister,Mentalcomposer
maybe because he said they bonded over their shared military service,Mentalcomposer
we dont really know that op even knew his grandpa had any money or if he did he assumed it would go to gramps child  ops parent,Mentalcomposer
op was at his lowest and sought out the person who could relate to what he was going thru after his deployment his visits could have started for that exact purpose but turned into wanting to make sure his grandpa wasnt alone in his last years,Mentalcomposer
its possible he actually enjoyed visiting,Mentalcomposer
i dont think we can understand what op went thru on deployment and how having that outlet was probably vital to his well being,Mentalcomposer
for all we know grandpa might have wanted op to have the money knowing he wouldnt be around forever and wanted to ensure op had the financial resources to get the help he needed in the future,Mentalcomposer
its happening whether you fear it or not so just dont dwell on it,Mentalcomposer
concentrate on the excitement of the baby,Mentalcomposer
and like the other poster said you dont care about anything but getting that baby out of you youre just done being pregnant,Mentalcomposer
obviously this relationship is not working  why would you want to put more effort in,Mentalcomposer
break up but take some time to get yourself straightened out nobody wants a sad depressed partner who wont talk to them,Mentalcomposer
once youre happy with and by yourself you can be a good partner to someone,Mentalcomposer
if he says hes not very experienced i think in this instance you should believe him,Mentalcomposer
its possible he thinks you expect him to be good at sex given his age and since he doesnt have much experience he knows hes not and that makes him overthink and get nervous,Mentalcomposer
youve also only been dating for 3 months and as close as you are he might still need to be even more comfortable with you to be intimate,Mentalcomposer
dont stress over it and dont rush either,Mentalcomposer
the problem with roaches in an apt building is that even if your gf bombs her place with the strongest stuff she can find shes gonna get them back again because her neighbors will still have them and roaches will eventually get back to hers,Mentalcomposer
thats why the whole building needs to be treated at the same time and even then theres no guarantee,Mentalcomposer
why didnt you use the same stuff on your gf apt that you used on your place,Mentalcomposer
roaches aside youre mean to your gf the coat incident was inexcusable,Mentalcomposer
i agree i love a loaded salad its a complete meal,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
so you make your gf leave your place after seeing one roach and that made her cry but then call her back to open presents,Mentalcomposer
then you gift her a used coat and when she doesnt want to wear it to this party you make her feel bad about it and tell her youll give it to someone else  of course shes gonna cry,Mentalcomposer
whats wrong with you  do you even like your gf,Mentalcomposer
she cannot help the roach problem you do know that right im sorry one hitched a ride over to your place but it happens,Mentalcomposer
then you get insulted she wont wear the coat because she wants to wear the other one she also just got and you go off on her,Mentalcomposer
leave her alone or be a nicer person,Mentalcomposer
ok so not a therapist makes the scene a bit better at least,Mentalcomposer
but also not really therapy more like a self help audiobook,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
i didnt watch past episode 1 but what kind of therapy is this,Mentalcomposer
and what ethical therapist would agree to have another person in a session taping it,Mentalcomposer
what kind of explanation could they possibly give to the therapist to make them agree to this,Mentalcomposer
there are two things going on here and they are both on her to address,Mentalcomposer
first the physical pain she is having is clearly not normal she needs to see a gyno and see what is available as far as treatment is concerned has she never seen a gyno or just never brought up this problem,Mentalcomposer
the second is her mentally she needs to address the fact that she cannot open up to you due to whatever happened to her,Mentalcomposer
this is non negotiable sex is as much mental as it is physical and she needs to address both of these for you two to have a healthy sex life,Mentalcomposer
you need to let her know that a healthy sex life is something you are not willing to forgo and that its up to her to get the help she needs or you dont see this relationship lasting,Mentalcomposer
its just that simple,Mentalcomposer
this is not a blame thing its just a fact that she is the one with the issues and shes not addressing them,Mentalcomposer
i also thought that at 20 its cute to wear your bf initial,Mentalcomposer
at 24 and after 4 years you grow out of the cute phase,Mentalcomposer
the thing is hes not really criticizing,Mentalcomposer
in your example he is saying that you should automatically know what he needs,Mentalcomposer
like are you supposed to read his mind  hes an ass just for that comment alone,Mentalcomposer
thats not bad communication thats a normal every day question that people would ask another when they see them a bit out of sorts,Mentalcomposer
and you had nothing to apologize for you did nothing wrong,Mentalcomposer
but i do agree with him that once you know what the problem is its better to ask to help instead of solve the problem for him those two statements arent really interchangeable,Mentalcomposer
overall his ego and self importance is way over the top hes not being honest hes trying so hard to prove to you and everyone else that hes so much better than you and them and when you and they dont come to that realization he outright tells them and you,Mentalcomposer
i give you credit for sticking it out for all those years,Mentalcomposer
yup i did,Mentalcomposer
so of course i had to read the whole thing,Mentalcomposer
can i point out that we havent gained a new wealth your bf has access to his savings acct,Mentalcomposer
otherwise you are nta but your sister owes an apology to your bf,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
what kind of weird crap is this,Mentalcomposer
im guessing you had no boyfriends until now and hes not even really a bf youre just hanging out  but not really cause you havent even seen him  just the fact that you physically leave the house freaks out your dad so of course the solution is to make you live elsewhere,Mentalcomposer
theres got to be more to this are you a deeply religious family is it usual to have an arranged marriage is the boy a diff religion race anything,Mentalcomposer
and whats with your mom not thinking your dad is a complete and utter wackadoodle and telling him so,Mentalcomposer
id say run as far and fast as you can cause your parents are nuts  grandmas is looking better and better but i know you cant do that,Mentalcomposer
dont get stuff just for the sake of having,Mentalcomposer
pick walk art knick backs that actually have some meaning to them or youll end up with useless clutter,Mentalcomposer
every wall or shelf doesnt have to be full,Mentalcomposer
buy what you need and use what you buy once,Mentalcomposer
what is wrong with your son  there must be something because 10 year olds arent usually this cruel and whats with him opening gifts before xmas  yeah somethings not right here,Mentalcomposer
im worried what hes going to do to his sister to get back at her for him not getting any gifts,Mentalcomposer
thats how i saw it,Mentalcomposer
once her dad got the letter it became his property and he should be allowed to do with it whatever he wants,Mentalcomposer
can someone explain the court case where she sued the mail about the letter,Mentalcomposer
did the court find in her favor without a trial,Mentalcomposer
and then when knauf gave his evidence which clearly showed she lied to the court did the court really just chalk it up to her not remembering writing a slew of emails,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
awesome  thanks putting it on my list,Mentalcomposer
do you mean its not a fun ship  in general what are the entertainment options,Mentalcomposer
i really like the look of this ship but i want some fun activities not all out crazy but i dont want the ship to be quiet by 10 pm,Mentalcomposer
hows the casino if you went,Mentalcomposer
thanks,Mentalcomposer
so you hate your lying   cheating secretive bf and you think your biggest issue is trying to figure out how not to have sex with him,Mentalcomposer
do you think hes suddenly going to have an epiphany of  wow my gf wont have sex with me better change my ways so she doesnt leave me,Mentalcomposer
hes not going to therapy hes not going to change and hes not leaving,Mentalcomposer
the quicker you admit this the better you will be,Mentalcomposer
yeah ive always thought the opposite,Mentalcomposer
i always wondered how many people they actually convert or even convince to check out the religion,Mentalcomposer
they really dont start the conversation with a compelling argument its usually a boring can i talk to you about,Mentalcomposer
i think they like having to go on these missions just to see diff areas of the country,Mentalcomposer
hell tell you he appreciates all you do so that youll keep doing everything,Mentalcomposer
this right here is what you will be dealing with if you marry him he will not suddenly begin to pull his weight and his video game addiction will not just stop,Mentalcomposer
think long  and hard about if thats what you want in 3510 years,Mentalcomposer
nothing else to be said you said it perfectly,Mentalcomposer
this is what she needs to hear and what she needs to do,Mentalcomposer
congratulations  you should be proud of yourself im proud of you too,Mentalcomposer
if the filled bread is put in a panini press i call that a panini,Mentalcomposer
if i grill the bread filled with ham and cheese in a pan on the stove top then its a grilled ham and cheese,Mentalcomposer
toast to me is just toasted bread topped with something  butter jellyetc and is eaten one slice at a time not put together like a sandwich,Mentalcomposer
and a sandwich is just two slices of bread with a filling whether its toasted or not,Mentalcomposer
there is absolutely no reason for your wife to get that worked up over something so trivial ten minutes is not going to make a difference did she even feel bad about co ti king to blow up at you,Mentalcomposer
partners can only take so much abuse before they snap and you did but at least you recognize that its not a point you want to get to ever again so thats good,Mentalcomposer
time for some serious lay down the rules talk if she does this frequently explain that its not making a happy home for anyone especially your children she should not be ranting and raving over everything,Mentalcomposer
if its a one off find out why this day in particular she was so obsessed with d being ready at the exact time and by making a huge deal of it im sure she didnt leave when she wanted to anyway,Mentalcomposer
so what exactly did she achieve she achieved having her h disgusted by the her behavior and ultimately his own,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
how cheap is he that 40 is a big deal,Mentalcomposer
he knew it was going to be too big so its not really a surprise,Mentalcomposer
you didnt have another bag which he also knew so what did he expect you to do magically produce another bag out of nowhere,Mentalcomposer
your h is an ass,Mentalcomposer
im leaning toward you being the ah but not on purpose youre young and probably havent had to make big decisions yet between a so and your mom and its overwhelming,Mentalcomposer
youve only been together 7 mo you see each other all the time over the course of the year and youre both pretty young,Mentalcomposer
i sympathize with your gf its obviously a terrible situation but she has family that can help her deal with grieving and while it would be great to be there for her its not like she will be alone,Mentalcomposer
plus im guessing this is the first time youre meeting her family they might not want an outsider around at this time,Mentalcomposer
on the other hand your mother is alone and im sure was looking forward to your visit its one of the few times she gets to see you all year,Mentalcomposer
go home and spend the holiday with your mom your gf has support but i would do anything for my mom and would never leave her alone on a holiday yes its only one day but the thought of my mom celebrating all alone with no joy on the day would kill me,Mentalcomposer
of course my thought is that you actually like and get along with your mom if you dont get along and dread going home ever then take the out and stay away,Mentalcomposer
i think they are both trying to guilt you into doing what they want make up your own mind what do you think is the right thing to do in your heart and your mind,Mentalcomposer
edit  i just saw your mom could spend xmas with your aunt and uncle and isnt alone alone,Mentalcomposer
so no judgement still but id go home anyway,Mentalcomposer
how long are you with your gf and also do you go to the same school or only see her occasionally,Mentalcomposer
why are you even going to your dads if he treats you badly youre old enough to decide where you want to be for holidays,Mentalcomposer
where is your mom spending xmas,Mentalcomposer
i would think your mom would love to spend the first xmas after her husband passed with people who also  loved him,Mentalcomposer
also is your mom the mother of your sis and nephew that passed  even more reason to spend it with her,Mentalcomposer
yta theyre both your nephews treat them the same or when the older one finally figures it out he wont want anything to do with you because of your disdain for him,Mentalcomposer
you might think the 20 yo is just being a bum and not actually finding himself but he may actually be trying to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
from experience  not mine tho,Mentalcomposer
some guys dont want college but they also cannot see themselves sitting in an office all day but they also cant see themselves doing an outside trade job,Mentalcomposer
yes its irrational  as it was to me to hear  to you because there arent many other alternatives but at some point they get a spark of something and it all comes together for them,Mentalcomposer
give him time you dont have to like it  it hes not your kid,Mentalcomposer
i literally laughed out loud at that,Mentalcomposer
so i guess chris isnt allowed out of the bed until she gets her cuddles in,Mentalcomposer
what a ridiculously immature thing to think as a 26 yo never mind text to the mother of his child,Mentalcomposer
youre not a loser nobody is a loser,Mentalcomposer
do you have a roommate why arent you friendly with him,Mentalcomposer
join a club at your school or an intramural team or volunteer somewhere on campus,Mentalcomposer
or just start saying hi and talking to every  person you see in your dorm building,Mentalcomposer
why havent you done this the first week you were on campus when literally every club was looking for people,Mentalcomposer
youre not gonna make friends if you shut yourself away nobody is gonna come knocking on your door and say hi i want to be your friend,Mentalcomposer
and dont worry so much about attracting girls because with your attitude of thinking of yourself as a loser girls sense that and they want no part of it,Mentalcomposer
the gym is good as long as you go to better yourself and not just to attract someone,Mentalcomposer
get out there and just do something the pieces will all fall into place,Mentalcomposer
we just did a dinner out with immediate family godparents and grandparents,Mentalcomposer
your argument against judging by todays standard is spot on,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to like what the person did or stood for in their time but the fact remains that it was acceptable in their time it happened and was celebrated,Mentalcomposer
key point is  at that time,Mentalcomposer
better to show those statues and have a discussion about the person the act the time in history than to lock them away and never discuss to understand what was going on at that time,Mentalcomposer
that is history for good or bad,Mentalcomposer
info,Mentalcomposer
how old is your son his kids and your younger kids,Mentalcomposer
does your dil work,Mentalcomposer
we used to rent strollers and when we returned the stroller we were given one but only 1 around 9700,Mentalcomposer
thats where i got mine,Mentalcomposer
they are in the photo albums from the trip,Mentalcomposer
yes,Mentalcomposer
and honestly if they would drop the titles and go on their merry way without any mention of his mom his family her family the press i would wish them well in their merchandising endeavors  well id really be rooting for failure but,Mentalcomposer
just go do whatever the hell you want to do as just h and or m write a blog do a reality show pick a cause and champion it just please no more podcasts that was painful just leave everyone else the hell alone and live your freakin life already,Mentalcomposer
ive been keeping up saw a bunch of clips read a bunch my post just tipped the iceberg as you probably know,Mentalcomposer
cant wait for the fallout from the book,Mentalcomposer
only the first episode,Mentalcomposer
did i miss something,Mentalcomposer
we loved that ride  sad to see it go,Mentalcomposer
and we dont really like the new railroad thing,Mentalcomposer
some rides are just classic and shouldnt be messed with,Mentalcomposer
oh where to start,Mentalcomposer
this might get long,Mentalcomposer
try to figure out how they met theres been about 3 diff versions,Mentalcomposer
2 diff versions of the proposal and one that she filmed and live streamed to a friend who does that,Mentalcomposer
now they might want these things to be private but then why even talk about it on a netflix show and out out diff versions,Mentalcomposer
pretty strong evidence that she had been planning to merchandise her and h and the royal connection since before they were married,Mentalcomposer
she lies about her childhood dumps her dad who raised her and suddenly her mom is in the picture to capitalize on her mixed race when up until then she was self identifying as white that rubs ppl the wrong way,Mentalcomposer
add in her admission of wanting to harm herself while pregnant but then not getting any help while being principals in a mh foundation never mind h admitting he didnt know how to get her help and the fam would not help when they didnt really ask for it,Mentalcomposer
m being on a royal tour complaining that shes not getting paid for this,Mentalcomposer
then she and harry are saying she was discriminated against based on her race if it happened they are right to call it out but they have not given one instance of it its all vague cryptic statements,Mentalcomposer
she claims being harassed by paparazzi but there is no evidence of that she claims the fam leaked stories to the press yet no evidence she didnt like negative stories in the press and wanted the fam to get them taken down the fam doesnt have that power but she took it as they wanted to slam her,Mentalcomposer
add in h harping on all day long about his dead mom and his generational pain and its just become a clown show at this point and a lot of his behavior has come out since hes been with her so what has she said or done to him to make him turn on his family,Mentalcomposer
she wants to be a globally known brand she wants fame and money and status shes been trying to do this for almost all of her adult life it hasnt happened even with her marrying into a very famous and influential family and shes grasping at whatever will keep her name in the spotlight,Mentalcomposer
hes just a middle aged man who gained weight and is in his own home where he can be comfortable,Mentalcomposer
we all have spent days just lounging around looking sloppy and so have our partners,Mentalcomposer
he looks presentable when he needs to cut him some slack on this one,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
this is an absolute nothing your gf is being ridiculous good lord its like middle school,Mentalcomposer
your gf is getting upset over your passcode  read that again your passcode on your phone,Mentalcomposer
you must be the most perfect man on the planet if this is the thing shes choosing to get upset about,Mentalcomposer
i dont care if youre good or bad with tech or know how to change it there is no reason to and thats what you should tell her,Mentalcomposer
mazda 3,Mentalcomposer
were on our third one,Mentalcomposer
the 2009 is still being driven by first kid,Mentalcomposer
2014 is now the second kids car,Mentalcomposer
2017  is ours,Mentalcomposer
how else are we supposed supposed to hear his generational pain if hes not the one speaking,Mentalcomposer
how will we know how tortured his life was,Mentalcomposer
maybe hell choke up a bit at timesreally try to pull at the heartstrings,Mentalcomposer
if were really lucky we might get an actual sob,Mentalcomposer
yta for putting up with that loser and his freeloading sister and her kids,Mentalcomposer
why are you with him  he obviously doesnt give a crap about you,Mentalcomposer
give yourself the biggest gift this year your independence from him,Mentalcomposer
you just started talking and youre already spoiling her  in what way,Mentalcomposer
she comes with a lot going on  living with baby daddy not financially independent and has 2 very very young kids you cannot possibly want to take on all of that can you afford to support all 4 of you and more importantly do you even want to,Mentalcomposer
im getting not on the up and up vibes from her id pass on this one there really isnt any upside for you,Mentalcomposer
i dont get angry or upset it just causes unconscious eye rolling which id like to avoid,Mentalcomposer
any qs where someone wants their so to basically have zero contact with anyone of the opposite sex no talking no friends on sm,Mentalcomposer
friends from childhood gone,Mentalcomposer
lab partners  gone,Mentalcomposer
study buddies  gone,Mentalcomposer
co workers they talk to  gone,Mentalcomposer
exes  gone,Mentalcomposer
theres only one person who they should cut contact with and that would be an affair partner and you,Mentalcomposer
you arent mature enough no matter your age to be in a relationship if you have this view,Mentalcomposer
edit and as soon as i posted the next feed is my bf is still friends with his ex,Mentalcomposer
insert eyeroll,Mentalcomposer
the driving might just be an age thing as stupid as that sounds but teens speed i might also let whoever that minor in the car with him that asking him to go faster is a def no go,Mentalcomposer
the more concerning part for me is when you said that when things are going well in life he feels uncomfortable,Mentalcomposer
if he doesnt know now might be a good time to open up about his moms behavior over the years is your ex actually diagnosed or are her issues your best guess,Mentalcomposer
if diagnosed it might help to move your son to be more open to therapy if he can see what his future may look like if he doesnt get a handle on it now,Mentalcomposer
its tough because you dont want him to think that you think  in his teen mind hes crazy or mental or insane or any other euphemism he might use so tread carefully,Mentalcomposer
and why isnt knauf just releasing these writings,Mentalcomposer
i also find it hysterical that they seem to think knauf is biased because he was working for william,Mentalcomposer
they left and the guy had no job he was obviously good at whatever he did enough that the dumb dumb duo used him as their go between with amid the scabies,Mentalcomposer
so the royal household or office or whatever gave him another job was he supposed to just disappear into oblivion after being used by the despicable duo,Mentalcomposer
no not normally,Mentalcomposer
they might thank their parents and their guests for coming but this,Mentalcomposer
this is just cringy,Mentalcomposer
if you have to convince anyone that you have a grand love story than you dont have one,Mentalcomposer
unless she just doesnt,Mentalcomposer
whats gonna happen the rf wont allow a scene to be made,Mentalcomposer
they will once again do and say and get away with whatever they want,Mentalcomposer
best the fam can do is have them sit in the cheap seats along with other non family members,Mentalcomposer
maybe think of it this way you were the handful and got the attention you needed enough so that you cant even remember what you were doing to warrant all that extra support and wasnt it nice that your parents were there to do that h,Mentalcomposer
now its your bro needing the extra and youre upset but you need not be because his time needing the extra will end at some point,Mentalcomposer
then all will go back to normal with your parents being annoyingly up your butt again  cause thats what we do,Mentalcomposer
its hard trying to be the all for everyone at any given time one kid or the other will need more and we have to give it and yes sometimes at the expense of the other kid but it all will even out in the end,Mentalcomposer
if you get to the point where you have a problem or issue that seriously needs to be addressed then you voice that to your mom or dad and ask for some one on one time outside of the house to concentrate on that one issue if they say no then you reiterate that this is important and youre not just being whiny,Mentalcomposer
but i will say that just feeling like they arent validating your existence isnt really serious if and thats only if your bros issues are a serious thing i dont know what hes dealing with,Mentalcomposer
it should revive itself once the kids get a little bigger,Mentalcomposer
but you have to keep it somewhat going or it becomes the new norm,Mentalcomposer
like its not gonna be ok the kids are all somewhat self sufficient enough to not be all energy consuming and youll both have this unbridled passion for each other,Mentalcomposer
it needs to be a constant even if its a once a month type thing now thats at least a constant then it becomes twice a month and then once a week or whatever,Mentalcomposer
is there anyway to heat the mm tube enough to soften the butter and banana enough that you can get the cylinder out maybe boil some water and put the tube in it for a few seconds,Mentalcomposer
or try to cut the tube with a scissor,Mentalcomposer
i am kind of curious how this situation happened if you dont mind sharing,Mentalcomposer
maybe some scratch offs small keychains packs of sports cards mini candies,Mentalcomposer
i wouldnt buy one but if you get an actual card then i could see people buying it,Mentalcomposer
just for the historical implication of it,Mentalcomposer
theres no doubt all his ridiculousness will be written about at some point might be kind of worth it to have one maybe,Mentalcomposer
thats the only reason i bought the 5 campaign buttons just to have a little piece of history because hes just that absurd  please dont slam me for this yes i know it was another 5 in his coffers but whatever,Mentalcomposer
do these two actually believe anyone gives a rats ass where they are at any given point in time,Mentalcomposer
in case they or their minions follow along here no,Mentalcomposer
the answer is no,Mentalcomposer
nobody cares go away,Mentalcomposer
while i agree there will be headlines either way but what will they look,Mentalcomposer
like,Mentalcomposer
will it be they were snubbed and rightly so  which seems to be the way its going with the response to the docuwhine or because of what the book says or whatever else they just feel like vaguely moaning about,Mentalcomposer
or,Mentalcomposer
will it be the rf or kc is too soft on his wayward son and what will it take to finally be done with them how far is too far he literally called his father a liar  what he lied about is still anybody guess as they never give any concrete statements so i guess kc can use that as an excuse,Mentalcomposer
weve got a few months so lets see what else happens,Mentalcomposer
lady hussey really should have declined to even meet her,Mentalcomposer
what did she get out of it  nothing the damage has already been done its not like marlene took the blame and admitted it was all a set up,Mentalcomposer
theres no way i would ever even want to make all nice with that conniving grifter,Mentalcomposer
for me the gospel choir at the wedding would have been a beautiful addition if and only if megan or even just her mom had a longstanding relationship with a church that actually has a gospel choir hell even if she used to go as a child  and stopped as an adult to a church with one maybe she did and i missed that little fact,Mentalcomposer
i could be wrong but i equate gospel choirs with a predominantly black church which i actually like i think it makes the service idk less boring and it adds to the service lets face it church service is boring,Mentalcomposer
so the fact they added the choir literally just to play into her woc persona just didnt sit well with me as much as i enjoyed watching it,Mentalcomposer
i agree but his gf already doesnt want to stay at borgata,Mentalcomposer
we stay and play at b even tho we havent won there,Mentalcomposer
oh this made me think of something,Mentalcomposer
maybe it wasnt leaks to make them look bad but merely something they were doing in an official capacity but like everything else she does she missteps during it and thats what gets picked up by the journalists,Mentalcomposer
so for example if they visited a hospital of sick kids she refuses to touch or hug the kids   the paper would say yeah they visited but she was repulsed by sick kids or something like that,Mentalcomposer
so the story was bad but not by any fault of the family or palace,Mentalcomposer
stay at borgata for the free room and go over to ocean to play,Mentalcomposer
if youre going very soon be prepared that borgata is in the midst of renovating some slot areas there are a bunch of closed off sections so it looks messy,Mentalcomposer
if your gf doesnt really want to go anyway shell def not like it once she sees it,Mentalcomposer
but shell pick and choose select lines from long posts that are someone commenting things like what if is it possible allegedly and i heard a rumor that,Mentalcomposer
and then say see theyre spreading all these lies,Mentalcomposer
shes not gonna show a post saying they did this on this day and then said this on this day whats the truth,Mentalcomposer
or posts that point out evidence of her obvious lies,Mentalcomposer
of course its gayle he wont be asked about anything thats been revealed as being a lie or deceitful,Mentalcomposer
shell lob softball qs that have been answered ad nauseam in three diff ways maybe hell have a fourth answer,Mentalcomposer
who at this point will even watch this drivel,Mentalcomposer
unless its live and a respectable hard hitting journalist i think im busy cleaning bathrooms that day,Mentalcomposer
i love this idea,Mentalcomposer
maybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom  because she does actually have a live mom even tho she doesnt see her might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with just so the little girl doesnt feel totally rejected,Mentalcomposer
its possible his collar is visible when hes carrying lilly that way,Mentalcomposer
if the collar is not buttoned all the way up like if you are wearing a tie they are actually roomy plus the front of the shirt would just slide up,Mentalcomposer
plus shes a small child she can def fit between his collar and his neck,Mentalcomposer
i dont know if its photo shopped or not but the collar is not a smoking gun to me,Mentalcomposer
but what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda after breaking up,Mentalcomposer
and if it was while they were together again what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda while dating a nobody,Mentalcomposer
i think they dont want to get pulled into her crazy,Mentalcomposer
i think youre getting ahead of yourself here,Mentalcomposer
lets say that someone legitimately not mentally ill gets kidnapped gmafb they will be placed assessed and have you ever thought that maybe just maybe they will be referred to somewhere that will help address whatever their issue is since its not mh this is a good thing,Mentalcomposer
you seem to think an actual mental health provider is going to hold people that dont need their services when in actuality those providers want to free up space for the ones that they can actually help,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for abuse everywhere give the program a chance before you condemn it,Mentalcomposer
you say if they want to help then get to the root cause  well thats exactly what they are trying to do,Mentalcomposer
we were one of the million that actually watched the show we liked it too but even back then i remember i didnt like her character and it wasnt personal to her just didnt like her storyline,Mentalcomposer
but it never registered to me that she was mixed race i wasnt looking for it i dont remember it being in any plot line and i just didnt make the connection until her dad was introduced and then was like   huh shes black then happily went back to watching and even now i dont remember if there was any substantial plot regarding her race but i could be wrong there,Mentalcomposer
all this is for nothing if theyre not even invited,Mentalcomposer
would anyone really be surprised if they werent,Mentalcomposer
dont announce theyre not invited and maybe use their pr to ask media to not even mention the are they arent they invited,Mentalcomposer
im sure m will make it known but if the uk press doesnt report it how much traction can they get  after a while the us press will realize they as a whole are a non story,Mentalcomposer
no one treated her like a black person,Mentalcomposer
because no one even knew she was half black  kind of what happens when you yourself hide that info,Mentalcomposer
of course when she starts to date h did anyone care to want to know anything about her background as would have happened with anyone he dated lets be real the press would have dug into anyones background and found the worst things they could,Mentalcomposer
but notice she has no instances of how she was treated differently,Mentalcomposer
the compton and chimp thing was over the line no doubt but as pointed out those were condemned by the press against the press,Mentalcomposer
if they release any recordings even if its so called shocking people who dont really have an opinion either way will suddenly have one and it wont be in their favor,Mentalcomposer
regular every day people know that families arent perfect and have their dirty laundry but we dont air it,Mentalcomposer
same kraft is great when i want quick but homemade is a treat to myself,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
sorry but ywbta to demolish it,Mentalcomposer
the prudent thing to do is to sell it and split the proceeds among the kids,Mentalcomposer
i can sort of understand your attachment to the home you built but really youll be dead you wont know or care who will be living there,Mentalcomposer
and think about it this way,Mentalcomposer
from your description whoever buys it will be wealthy and will go in and change it to how they like it and that might upset you to think about but its going to become someone elses dream house another family that will raise their children to have the happy childhood that you were able to give your kids that legacy alone should give you some peace,Mentalcomposer
the worst part of this whole story is that your kids are already fighting over who deserves the house more,Mentalcomposer
im sorry what here i was thinking your kids had an awesome upbringing going and then we see that they have turned into greedy self serving adults,Mentalcomposer
cause lets face it one of them will get the house maybe live there till they realize its too expensive to maintain it and then theyll sell it anyway and keep that windfall,Mentalcomposer
in the process their sibling relationships will fail,Mentalcomposer
stipulate to sell the house if one of your kids can afford it they are more than welcome to bid on it,Mentalcomposer
well that blows my theory out thanks tho its good for me to know going forward,Mentalcomposer
i probably wouldnt be able to do a perfectly proper curtsy if i was put on the spot  which is a ridiculous claim that she didnt even know the q was going to be there but id sure as hell try to do something genuine looking,Mentalcomposer
the q seemed to have a funny side so if it came out looking like a baby deer learning to walk shed probably laugh it off id be mortified but id apologize anyway and promise to learn the diff is i would actually learn how,Mentalcomposer
but that witch of a champion of women feels its beneath her to even to the most esteemed woman in the world,Mentalcomposer
my theory is that when you first start out it allows for typos and small errors like missing accent marks,Mentalcomposer
as you progress it marks them wrong because it thinks you should know that by now,Mentalcomposer
as of now i havent been marked wrong for the accent marks yet and i hope it doesnt happen in the future,Mentalcomposer
im only unit 6 so still early and i may be wrong but words that i misspell are usually many letters so its easy to misspell when starting out but the ones that ive seen for a while get marked wrong,Mentalcomposer
she cant get specific because everything they said happened didnt,Mentalcomposer
its too easy to go back to that person and have them refute it all,Mentalcomposer
and they think theyre smarter than literally every single other person on the planet and that we wouldnt see right thru that,Mentalcomposer
at this point they can have a public ccv camera that recorded literally any mundane thing that they did and i still wouldnt believe it happened if it came from them,Mentalcomposer
they have lost all credibility and rightly so,Mentalcomposer
or she just doesnt like the name harry she thinks william got the cooler name  h isnt a very oooular name in the us i dont think,Mentalcomposer
who knows in her deluded mind,Mentalcomposer
do you think she calls him hazbeen when shes raging at him  that would be priceless,Mentalcomposer
i do agree with taking some time to cool off if you say thats what youre doing and its a short amount of time walk around the block go for a drive but op also says she went and stayed with her parents for a few weeks,Mentalcomposer
thats not really a cooling off period seems more like trying to solve that problem from afar and we dont know if h took a small time to cool off or hes still gone,Mentalcomposer
but again a short cooling off period is sometimes a good thing,Mentalcomposer
especially that both of them have left the home after an argument,Mentalcomposer
that is not a healthy way to resolve conflict,Mentalcomposer
love that last line  its so simple but so true,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
of course your son would be upset with you,Mentalcomposer
do you really think he would tell you hes gay if hes not or if hes not sure  he has a boyfriend even,Mentalcomposer
how your son looks or his hobbies and interests have absolutely no bearing in regard to his sexuality i dont know why you would even think that,Mentalcomposer
you owe him a huge apology if hed even accept it,Mentalcomposer
be a better parent,Mentalcomposer
im sorry but i am failing to see what you are so mad about,Mentalcomposer
are you mad because they lied to you all these years,Mentalcomposer
well id be willing to bet that there have been a lot of people who over the years have lied to you about one thing or another this lie really has no bearing on your life it hasnt made it better and it def hasnt made it worse this is an absolute nothing i find it extremely hard to believe if you have never lied to anyone why was it ok for you to tell a lie but not anyone else,Mentalcomposer
or are you mad about the age gap being what it is,Mentalcomposer
in which case that really is not your business they were both adults when they got together and thats really the only thing that matters,Mentalcomposer
they have stayed together so that in itself should show you that they are happy together,Mentalcomposer
now you may feel a bit weirded out by the gap but that is your personal moral code and you have no right to impose or pass judgement on anyone even if its your dad,Mentalcomposer
it seems you are taking this news way too personal as if something was done to you your life was a happy one with sam in it why would you purposefully make problems when there really isnt one,Mentalcomposer
why are you even looking at 3 br homes,Mentalcomposer
your realtor should not even be showing you them,Mentalcomposer
keep looking you will find a 4 bed that will call to you just as much as this one and you will be grateful when 2 teen girls are not fighting over space,Mentalcomposer
i have 5 siblings i can honestly say i have rarely bought any of them gifts for their bday and i like and get along and hang out with all of them,Mentalcomposer
it just isnt a thing occasionally if its a big bday and theyre having a party for it then ill get a gift 253050th,Mentalcomposer
as far as im concerned parents get gifts for everything,Mentalcomposer
if this is your partners only sib then an xmas gift is ok since shed be left out when every one is opening gifts,Mentalcomposer
but id stop the bday gifts,Mentalcomposer
ah thank you i was obviously confused,Mentalcomposer
i thought the prince title could never be removed and i thought the king couldnt remove the duke title that it had to be done by parliament and that this bill would give the king the power,Mentalcomposer
good to know parliament can at least do some stripping of titles at some point,Mentalcomposer
ill refrain from commenting till i understand the whole issue it does get confusing,Mentalcomposer
personally id like both titles stripped from h he hasnt lived up to either of them,Mentalcomposer
as far as andrew as long as he keeps himself hidden away i can wait for his turn in the next round  not that i condone anything he has done but hes at least staying within the bounds the q set for him,Mentalcomposer
parliament doing the stripping would be the best thing that could happen,Mentalcomposer
maybe kc can put out a weakly worded statement in opposition just to appear to give a sht but if it comes from above him theres nothing he can do about it,Mentalcomposer
maybe parliament can throw around some key words treason grievous harm prosecute etc,Mentalcomposer
youre not the only one who doesnt drink just dont make a big deal out of it or talk about those that do,Mentalcomposer
go to the parties grab a soda and have fun nobody is going to know or care,Mentalcomposer
since i have no experience in nursing but frequently am the visitor to a patient frequently admitted  chronic issues,Mentalcomposer
i like the idea that i can go in to visit and connect with a nurse to give me the daily update too often i have no idea what the diagnosis actually is and the waiting for a nurse to have the time to come in and advise is usually long i dont think that aspect harms patient care many times i have questions later on and this would be helpful,Mentalcomposer
i dont have an issue with a virtual doing paperwork things like discharges but maybe the actual on site nurse should have to sign off on the paperwork thats been prepared thats a good check and balance in case something has been missed or overlooked by the virtual that isnt actually seeing the medical state of a patient,Mentalcomposer
im not sure about admission assessments i would think theres a lot of nuances that in person can pick up on i would think patients especially older folks would downplay their illness pain uncomfort but in house might pick up on all this,Mentalcomposer
the idea of a virtual monitoring labs or electronic monitoring info may prove helpful but only if its being done in a timely manner sort of like what good is a lab report that needs immediate action if its not being looked at immediately no matter whose looking,Mentalcomposer
theres always a fear with this that virtual nurses will evolve into doing too much and things will slip thru the cracks almost like how if an in house nurse is so busy the virtuals will eventually become too overloaded as well because really they still need to be paid and it does seem that hospitals are all about cutting expenses anyway,Mentalcomposer
do you think a program like this could eventually lead to too few actual nurses on the floor and what could that mean for patient care,Mentalcomposer
thanks for posting its certainly an interesting idea,Mentalcomposer
those eco warriors dont you just love them,Mentalcomposer
but if it was a borrowed plane its ok right  all the carbon footprints are someone elses,Mentalcomposer
oh its for security they say  yes well theyre doing such good things in the world someone just must be after them to stop them from ridding the world of all those racists,Mentalcomposer
did i miss any other excuses,Mentalcomposer
if they were editing based on public opinion there would be no show,Mentalcomposer
what they should be doing is taking what they say and present the other factual side of the whole damn story,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
stay at your brothers and dont even answer her texts,Mentalcomposer
she needs to learn that she cant keep pushing shes going to have to figure out a way to not need constant attention from you,Mentalcomposer
take your time to figure out what you want to say then text her with that,Mentalcomposer
dont get into a pissing match with her about your action of leaving just concentrate on her actions her actions had consequences too bad so sad,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
seriously how long are you going to coddle the 24 yo,Mentalcomposer
she obviously has horrible taste in men and if i had to guess your and her dads marriage wasnt great and thats part of the reason why,Mentalcomposer
she needs help but in the professional way not mommy cleaning up after the fact,Mentalcomposer
do you not remember when your older kids were in hs and how important dances proms plays sporting events were,Mentalcomposer
you have done this all 4 times but your d is doing all this for the first time  think about that for a bit,Mentalcomposer
thats the kinda the point,Mentalcomposer
it was 1 day that you specifically asked for and he couldnt even just handle it and not moan about it,Mentalcomposer
and this 1 day was when you were going to give birth to his child,Mentalcomposer
but good luck today may your labor be quick and painless my third was the easiest delivery and the easiest baby too,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your h really couldnt help  and i hate that he even thinks hes helping when its his kids get the kids situated one morning,Mentalcomposer
i was a sahm for all my kids i readily volunteered for all night stuff because my h had to get up early for work,Mentalcomposer
but if i had a bad night or couldnt settle the baby and woke him he never bitched and moaned about it he got up did what he had to do and went back to sleep,Mentalcomposer
was he a bit more tired at work im sure but weve all been tired at work for whatever reason,Mentalcomposer
i dont understand a partner that moans when they have to do one teeny tiny thing other than what has been deemed their chores or their part,Mentalcomposer
like seriously are we partners or are we two people who share space and children,Mentalcomposer
i read one article where h said theres a hierarchy of the family,Mentalcomposer
he cannot be that stupid,Mentalcomposer
like yeah duh,Mentalcomposer
youve been doing this your whole life and just figured out that the monarch comes first the heir second and so on down the line,Mentalcomposer
i really think the dumb duo mean,Mentalcomposer
we wanted to do something and they told us no because cs or ws thing takes precedent,Mentalcomposer
the first snow of the year is always so beautiful isnt it,Mentalcomposer
i hope your pups  enjoyed it,Mentalcomposer
i hate saying this because whats done is done but  you bothered to read about the failure rate about bcps  but that still didnt register to you that you should have been using condoms also i dont fault you for believing her when she said she was on the pill but oh man shes something else,Mentalcomposer
so that out of the way im not judging cause this is just way to big to judge on teenagers,Mentalcomposer
has she even said that she wants to keep the baby thats what you need to ask,Mentalcomposer
then what you do is tell your parents that shes pregnant,Mentalcomposer
you cannot handle this by yourself,Mentalcomposer
again in case you didnt get it the first time,Mentalcomposer
you cannot handle this by yourself,Mentalcomposer
you her and both sets of parents need to sit down and figure out what you are all going to do,Mentalcomposer
you cannot make her get an abortion you may voice your stance that you are not ready to be a dad but she will do what she wants,Mentalcomposer
this is why you need adult parental guidance,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused with this story but why dont you write the letter but not send it,Mentalcomposer
give it to a friend to destroy,Mentalcomposer
maybe just the act of doing it will be enough,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
just for the fact that they are coming on xmas day and also staying for 2 nights,Mentalcomposer
isnt that enough,Mentalcomposer
honestly im surprised theyre not spending the holiday with her dad and or her siblings,Mentalcomposer
we did that the first xmas after my mom passed i usually swap years with my inlaws and it was their turn but i just felt i had to be with my fam  and it was hard,Mentalcomposer
but also that before this move she only moved 20 min away yet they havent seen her in ages,Mentalcomposer
theres is def a reason she doesnt want to see them,Mentalcomposer
im more curious about the tweet never saw that before,Mentalcomposer
id say the acct was hacked just based on the way it sounds but really some random hacker had months to figure out how to get into the acct just to tweet this,Mentalcomposer
what are the chances some hacker was invested in their story so much to spend their time doing this as opposed to idk literally getting into any other legitimately important persons acct,Mentalcomposer
maybe some palace insider just wanted to give them grief whether true or not and planned to tweet and delete on the off chance someone got a screen shot of it,Mentalcomposer
or m did it just to be able to say the rf wanted to ruin her by putting it out there,Mentalcomposer
idk why but i find this hysterical,Mentalcomposer
there is no excuse for what he did you really have no idea what he did with those recordings id be gone,Mentalcomposer
whatever you do one thing would be certain for me never another intimate video call or even a phone call,Mentalcomposer
ooh attacking american values  thats a new one,Mentalcomposer
its not enough the fam didnt like her now lets have them hating a whole country,Mentalcomposer
the only thing that might be somewhat new would be the people who didnt want them to marry,Mentalcomposer
we know william tried to slow h down but were there any others maybe charles or camilla suggested they wait to see if she fits with the fam or if shes up to the kind of life of service thats expected  or simply if she really just wanted h,Mentalcomposer
im sure theyll spin it to because theyre racist when we see now that all those objections would be true,Mentalcomposer
one things for sure h and m will not be telling any stories with any kind of detail that could show any kind of slight against them,Mentalcomposer
such as we were working with a to do a named project and person b did this and then said x,Mentalcomposer
itll all be very superficial i got the impression someone was trying to ruin a project  no name that we were trying to  start up,Mentalcomposer
i hope thats understandable it made sense when i thought it,Mentalcomposer
thats weird thats what fixed mine,Mentalcomposer
i am not techie at all so id say uninstall and reinstall but,Mentalcomposer
only if you remember your login,Mentalcomposer
sorry im out of ideas,Mentalcomposer
update the app,Mentalcomposer
we need to know what your mom said,Mentalcomposer
i had the same,Mentalcomposer
update your app it fixed it for me,Mentalcomposer
so like if he didnt even know the woman was pregnant,Mentalcomposer
yeah id be ok with that  good point,Mentalcomposer
oh geez could you just imagine he asks for a test and hes the one with random offspring out there,Mentalcomposer
way to shoot yourself in the foot,Mentalcomposer
karmas a bitch,Mentalcomposer
one more thought if you have friends that will vouch for you maybe you can ask them to co sign on a lease,Mentalcomposer
that might solve the credit issue,Mentalcomposer
then when the lease comes due and you fix the credit issue you can ask the landlord if they will do another credit check to see if youd be good on your own,Mentalcomposer
sorry just throwing ideas out there,Mentalcomposer
def not a prude its just an unusual situation wanting to see his accomplishment and also what makes this photographer so good at what they do and what they can capture what feelings the photos elicit,Mentalcomposer
as i said have someone cover what you dont want to see,Mentalcomposer
it would then be like what he shows in a bathing suit,Mentalcomposer
but at least youd be able to appreciate the art aspects of the photos,Mentalcomposer
good point about objects blocking his bits,Mentalcomposer
if that was the case she wouldnt be worried about viewing the pics but we really dont know either way youre right,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
that cousin tho wow  i really have no words,Mentalcomposer
you take care of yourself and when you feel back to fighting weight you give that rude condescending ah of a relation a huge verbal ass whooping,Mentalcomposer
family harmony be damned she needs to be called out and called out loudly she needs to be ostracized by the family,Mentalcomposer
you have an income that would afford you a pretty good life,Mentalcomposer
air bnbs are gonna cut into that i would think pretty quickly,Mentalcomposer
instead of trying to get an apt that would have a credit check maybe try to find a roommate situation,Mentalcomposer
after that you need to build more credit cc might not be viable but a monthly subscription to a magazine would help  i did that when i first started out,Mentalcomposer
and dont stop with the credit companies fight until you get an answer from them of what documentation you need to accept the name change and then get it to them  maybe check with a lawyer if what they are doing is even legal and send your docs with a letter from the lawyer,Mentalcomposer
she knows theres a racial divide still in america and she plays off that,Mentalcomposer
this is exactly why she plays it up so much,Mentalcomposer
dont you know she can single handily cure the world of racism if she could just let everyone in the whole wide world know that she and she alone is calling out racism,Mentalcomposer
oh and that pesky resume listing her as white  well the racists in all of hollywood would never ever cast her if they knew she wasnt lily white,Mentalcomposer
shes got nothing else to be victimized for,Mentalcomposer
id want to see them for the art aspect of it but as a mom of grown boys im with you where it seems idk the word  ick no strange maybe just some things moms dont need to see yes,Mentalcomposer
this will sound weird but maybe have someone cover his bits so that you can still see the pictures,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
youre jealous of a then 15 yo when your bf was what 23,Mentalcomposer
get over it already youre punishing a young woman who may have had a teenage crush,Mentalcomposer
i am curious tho how he even met her and were they friends in a sense that at 23 he was hanging out with teens,Mentalcomposer
that would say a lot more about your bf than this girl,Mentalcomposer
at this point  30 years and all kids are adults now and never ever having this convo,Mentalcomposer
go for it  knowing its a total and absolute waste of money,Mentalcomposer
although id probably ask to do something like a 23 and me for all of us this way well get all the ancestry in addition to the bio relationship,Mentalcomposer
kind of curious if all the kids ancestry would be exactly alike,Mentalcomposer
two birds one stone,Mentalcomposer
you know you should get out but why should you leave  if hes done then he can get out,Mentalcomposer
but id worry about my name being on the lease,Mentalcomposer
if its just your name then he leaves,Mentalcomposer
if its both of your names then dont go anywhere until you can figure out something with the landlord to get your name off,Mentalcomposer
if he stops paying youll be on the hook for it,Mentalcomposer
omg just plan to have a meal with each parent and their so if you have to meet them pick a restaurant have a meal then d can go home with gma or gpa for her visit,Mentalcomposer
do you not talk with or visit when you drop off your d  just how amicable is your relationship with each parent,Mentalcomposer
id be more concerned that since your dad is wanted in that country if they have been keeping tabs on him the govt might just know that his wife and d are arriving,Mentalcomposer
but i have no idea what country youre talking about t might be turkey in which case i dont know if id be that comfortable going,Mentalcomposer
just use the vacay money to bring a few relatives to you,Mentalcomposer
other than the house which i agree would cost them a lot of money each month and the nannies what else do they do that they pay for,Mentalcomposer
theyre not jetting around the world on humanitarian missions in which theyd need transport and lodging,Mentalcomposer
theyre not invited to award shows or hell even dinner parties with the a listers in which theyd need to buy something new to wear,Mentalcomposer
i dont pay too much attention to their day to day but theyve gone out to dinner what 2 times  oh and cant forget he uvalde visit,Mentalcomposer
so if they werent so full of themselves and had to have a huge home for 4 of them theyd probably be doing ok,Mentalcomposer
edit  nope they wouldnt be ok,Mentalcomposer
did some digging their monthly expenses are estimated at about 360000 plus repaying the frogmore renovations of 18000 per month  idk maybe 20000,Mentalcomposer
and this is not including landscaping maintenance which i couldnt find,Mentalcomposer
these 2 are screwed,Mentalcomposer
i have no doubt that she can have a platonic relationship with a guy especially if hes a family friend  someones son that her parents were friends with and therefore they grew up together,Mentalcomposer
but if you know for a fact she lied you need to talk about it why did she lie,Mentalcomposer
you say youre young how young,Mentalcomposer
when we are just starting on our dating journey it is possible we lie because we dont want to upset out bf gf of course our inexperience leads us to believe the other person will not know but with social media it always comes out,Mentalcomposer
talk to her in a non accusatory way,Mentalcomposer
you know her best is she coming across as truthful does she seem like shes lying or trying to hide anything from you,Mentalcomposer
what is her reasoning to deceive you while snapping from another guys bed  seriously where was he,Mentalcomposer
honestly if your gut is saying theres more to this there probably is trust it,Mentalcomposer
if youre not long term id say just cut your losses and move on,Mentalcomposer
of course im of an age where we didnt have sm so a lot of this is just bizarre to me,Mentalcomposer
love or need of her,Mentalcomposer
if he ditches her wheres he gonna go,Mentalcomposer
yeah what stakes,Mentalcomposer
there are no stakes its not a competition theres nothing to lose,Mentalcomposer
just go live your fn life and stop making every freakin thing about your what 72 days as a royal,Mentalcomposer
she really is a waste of life,Mentalcomposer
im sorry there is absolutely zero reasons why this bill should not be pushed thru and voted on,Mentalcomposer
it should be obvious to anyone in parliament that these two are not good for the uk never mind the rf,Mentalcomposer
and id be ok with a bill that strips the prince title too  unless its better to try the second born son for treason,Mentalcomposer
in which case im ok with that too,Mentalcomposer
whatever it takes to get them distanced for the rf,Mentalcomposer
dont you want to spend the holiday with your family,Mentalcomposer
if you think this is a long term thing you may as well get used to switching off or just spend it with your own family again and meet up later,Mentalcomposer
dont tell him you hate spending time with his family we all grow up getting used to our own familys way of doing things,Mentalcomposer
try to find something you can relate to with his mom i know its hard you have nothing in common with a middle aged woman,Mentalcomposer
keep it light tv shows local news maybe your job places youve visited etc,Mentalcomposer
and im sure you know no religion or politics,Mentalcomposer
who was taking all these pics,Mentalcomposer
theyre not official royal duty pics so what they had someone follow them around while they were dating before they got engaged during wedding planning  and the rf allowed this,Mentalcomposer
did she plan on a doc that early on,Mentalcomposer
thats some serious long con,Mentalcomposer
and adding in,Mentalcomposer
you know because no one protected my mum and we all know how that ended,Mentalcomposer
im gonna watch it have to see how they spin literally everything to their advantage,Mentalcomposer
but how else will they get sympathy if they dont play up how badly they are suffering if we dont see it,Mentalcomposer
oh yeah i read the daily mail every morning,Mentalcomposer
the amount of articles is unbelievable,Mentalcomposer
clicked one  but only one since i read here about not giving them clicks to read harry saying something about not knowing what goes on behind closed doors,Mentalcomposer
ironic no   considering what probably goes on behind their door,Mentalcomposer
i can just imagine tw waking this morning screeching to hazbeen   look im everywhere,Mentalcomposer
just tell her she agreed to the 100 amazon budget and then spent more with her sis,Mentalcomposer
if she wants more it has to come out of her separate account,Mentalcomposer
its kind of silly to buy so much the first year half the fun is adding on each year and seeing how your tastes are going to change each year,Mentalcomposer
im going to assume your parents have met the bf and like him,Mentalcomposer
that is literally half the battle,Mentalcomposer
but oh boy this has disaster written all over it and i hate to say it but if it goes badly i think itll be your parents fault,Mentalcomposer
off the top of my head,Mentalcomposer
first off you have got to beat into your parents head that they are absolutely not allowed to talk about their wealth at all  no way no how,Mentalcomposer
make them understand that saying anything that might reflect badly on his parents is just not done in polite society,Mentalcomposer
then forewarn his parents about how your parents are maybe explain that your values arent theirs and ask them to please dont get into it with them and to not take anything they may say personally as much as they would want to,Mentalcomposer
who knows tho maybe they will all get along and all your worries are for nothing,Mentalcomposer
good luck,Mentalcomposer
sorry i dont care how close friends they are those kind of flirty messages are never  their way of communication,Mentalcomposer
if you have to live constantly checking his phone hes not worth it youll never get to a place where you trust him again therefore leading to never giving your all to this partner and a relationship needs those things,Mentalcomposer
its really not that hard to not flirt with others if you are truly invested in the one youre with,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
should have done it long ago and just not said anything,Mentalcomposer
she probably wouldnt have even noticed,Mentalcomposer
and really she wont come over anymore second problem solved,Mentalcomposer
keep the album especially if you have kids,Mentalcomposer
both my parents are now passed,Mentalcomposer
my sister happened to take my parents wedding album home from visiting my step dad one day,Mentalcomposer
she brought it over and it was really nice to see them when they were young and in love,Mentalcomposer
they divorced when i was small and my dad passed a few years later,Mentalcomposer
and putting faces to grandparents i dont really remember,Mentalcomposer
they are memories you cannot capture from any other pics that might be floating around,Mentalcomposer
my truth,Mentalcomposer
your truth is your perception of a situation or your opinion or just you lying,Mentalcomposer
there is only the truth,Mentalcomposer
as bizarre as it is that he talked about his book and recounted stories its even more bizarre to me that hed get mad when others tried to change the subject,Mentalcomposer
like what these arent his friends he can get drunk and vent to these are business associates,Mentalcomposer
but i guess when you have no friends youll vent to anyone you can get and if he hadnt made this situation all on his own it would be really sad  but he did so its not,Mentalcomposer
are you upset that he put down single and that he may get in trouble for it,Mentalcomposer
or are you upset that youre not on the house and think if he put down married you would somehow own half the house,Mentalcomposer
nah,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that you havent had so much as a conversation with your mom about any of this,Mentalcomposer
somehow she found out on her own so can you really blame her for being a little salty about the whole situation,Mentalcomposer
she may be in denial or feel  as many parents do that youre just labeling yourself because its popular to do so or she may be just hurt that you didnt come to her when you had this revelation,Mentalcomposer
stop the passive aggressive crap that shows your immaturity and could actually reinforce your moms thinking that you just want a trendy label,Mentalcomposer
have a real honest down to earth talk with your mom,Mentalcomposer
stay calm and explain to her whats going on with you even if she gets excited or nasty or dismissive  hold your ground calmly,Mentalcomposer
she may not jump on board right away either but youre not making any progress as it is,Mentalcomposer
and when she agrees to your pronouns give her some leeway if she slips up  14 years is a long time to call you she her and now shes going to have to think before she addresses you every single time,Mentalcomposer
honestly i would think a nanny would be a useless expense and its not cheap,Mentalcomposer
hes home all day anyway he can take care of the baby and does he not think the baby needs him,Mentalcomposer
it is inconceivable that this man is writing all day every day,Mentalcomposer
most days hes probably not doing any writing at all thats how the writing process works,Mentalcomposer
why does he not want to care and nurture his child,Mentalcomposer
go to the office someone in this marriage has  to sustain this family,Mentalcomposer
just spend what you can easily afford on something that you think she would like,Mentalcomposer
dont forget that after the engagement theres a wedding and a honeymoon,Mentalcomposer
if you blow all your money on one ring you have to scrimp and save for the rest that comes after,Mentalcomposer
yes you are crazy,Mentalcomposer
your bf and his friend actually asked to vacation at your deceased dads house  without you,Mentalcomposer
then when you rightly said no they change their trip conveniently to where you are also going to be vacationing  but youre all not going together  why is that,Mentalcomposer
oh it gets better the friend not even your bf ask again to stay at your dads house oh but again youre not there but shes bringing her friend,Mentalcomposer
just tell them both to go to hell,Mentalcomposer
i do not believe you and bf are so in love that you have to bend over backward to appease not only him but his friend also,Mentalcomposer
and why do you think that,Mentalcomposer
because she stood up to some ah that made fun of your accent,Mentalcomposer
how about you just start standing up for yourself to ppl who make fun of you and to these two users,Mentalcomposer
nta for not entertaining his ridiculousness,Mentalcomposer
its absurd that he would even ask you to give him advice on his relationship youre not a couples counselor,Mentalcomposer
do away with both of them like literally dont even pick up her calls or,Mentalcomposer
texts,Mentalcomposer
they arent even your friends you know her because she is friends with your bfs cousin which at best make you acquaintances,Mentalcomposer
she picked him and wants to stay so let her deal with her own messed up life,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but i want to know how old frank is,Mentalcomposer
this is not your situation to manage,Mentalcomposer
and you dont know or even like this guy if rory and frank want to see each other they have to figure out a way,Mentalcomposer
every time she wants to see him youre gonna somehow get your parents to go visit family in queens  oh and youre just gonna conveniently being your best friend and then what disappear for a few hours to go see frank,Mentalcomposer
oh and her parents are strict about boys so add to this absurd scenario her parents finding out,Mentalcomposer
see how stupid this sounds,Mentalcomposer
really why cant you guys just find some nice boys where you live,Mentalcomposer
youre 15 youre supposed to be figuring out all this dating crap with other teens from school or a club or anywhere closer,Mentalcomposer
and as per usual the revenge dress will fail because it will be ill fitting,Mentalcomposer
the issue is not that you cant lose weight,Mentalcomposer
you dont have to lose weight,Mentalcomposer
the issue is,Mentalcomposer
you know youre at a healthy weight but you want to lose more weight to be skinnier you need to explore why you feel the need to be even smaller than you are,Mentalcomposer
do you see the difference,Mentalcomposer
did you tell the therapist that you are not happy with how you look and that is the reason you want to lose weight have you explained the binging purging and excessive exercise,Mentalcomposer
if you did and their advice was to eat more veggies you need a diff therapist,Mentalcomposer
your weight is perfectly fine you know this you acknowledge youre at a healthy weight,Mentalcomposer
do your parents know about your past  issues with your weight  if not now is a good time to tell them,Mentalcomposer
and if they do now is a good time to tell them,Mentalcomposer
if they dont make sure you see at the least your regular dr if not a therapist then tell a guidance counselor at school,Mentalcomposer
you need to get a handle on this now  before you do irreversible damage to your health,Mentalcomposer
ok im looking at this a bit differently than the other 2 commenters because its not just her whose saying she regrets not being with others you said it too,Mentalcomposer
i think her coworker was totally out of line with his behaviors i cant even imagine what he was thinking so im not gonna comment on that thats a while diff issue,Mentalcomposer
you say that it was rocky at the beginning but its better and you love each other now,Mentalcomposer
i think you need to check in with your wife about that and also do a brutally honest assessment of your own feelings,Mentalcomposer
if yours was truly a loving partnership marriage there really should be no reason to need validation from others on either side,Mentalcomposer
your start was tough because maybe you didnt really know each other that well but after 7 years you both should know if this is your person or not,Mentalcomposer
it shouldnt be we stay together for the son or were just comfortable in our day to day or itll cause too much upheaval to split up or any other superficial excuse you could both come up with,Mentalcomposer
you both should be staying together because this is actually the person you want to be with if its not youre both just prolonging the inevitable,Mentalcomposer
not that i think 28 is old by any stretch but having wild times that you both think you missed out on just isnt going to be the same at 2830 as opposed to 2125 and having sex with other people just for the sake of having sex with other people is a really crappy reason,Mentalcomposer
its time for some real honest soul searching by both of you neither of you can try to spare the others feelings in this if its not working its not working,Mentalcomposer
is she gonna tell all about her early life where her dear mother was thru her childhood all about what her dad has done for her the story about trevor or even better cheating on corey with h,Mentalcomposer
were gonna get her spin  from age 37 thru 41,Mentalcomposer
get out of here with this nonsense what publisher would agree to any of this knowing how neither one of them can actually deliver on what they promise,Mentalcomposer
are you really saying that h would go back to his family and eliminate his brother and all 3 of his kids just so he  and his wife can take the throne,Mentalcomposer
i hate them too but thats just way no to crazy land,Mentalcomposer
wth did i just read,Mentalcomposer
im gonna need to know what the argument was about that made you take a break for a week,Mentalcomposer
so without that some observations,Mentalcomposer
you seem to have a lot of control over him you read his messages and his journal and decide who he can talk too does he always do what you want him to,Mentalcomposer
and that crap about him having to break up with you  no put your big girl panties on and make a decision thats middle school level maturity,Mentalcomposer
you dont want a marriage you want a proposal and wedding so you can pretend you have some great love story that survived through all your  perceived struggles,Mentalcomposer
and your solution to this is to set an arbitrary date at which point if he doesnt want to get married you will leave  i think my eyes are stuck in the back of my head from that hard roll,Mentalcomposer
you two both have a lot of growing up to do and i think it should be done separately,Mentalcomposer
you are a grown man why are you moaning to your parents about your job when you readily admit that you bore everyone about it theres only so much a person can take,Mentalcomposer
figure your shit out for everyones sake,Mentalcomposer
make up with your parents and get some help you sound insufferable,Mentalcomposer
im sorry i dont understand this at all,Mentalcomposer
godparents where i come from are not expected to raise or even help raise the child,Mentalcomposer
its a religious thing for baptism i never expected anything from my kids godparents,Mentalcomposer
she is saying she expects you to be all in with this kid from day one then no id decline thats mom and dads job of course everyone needs some help occasionally so then its grandparents siblings and friends very occasionally,Mentalcomposer
how does she treat the godparents of her first child are they bending over backwards for this child and does she talk badly about them if they dont,Mentalcomposer
id tell her you just dont feel you will have the time and energy to help raise her child and in addition you feel very strongly that you plan on focusing on your child when you have them and arent going to worry about anyone elses household,Mentalcomposer
shes a selfish person and as you know a selfish friend this decision might finally get you free of her,Mentalcomposer
think how much hurt youre setting yourself up for in the future,Mentalcomposer
people who love you do not tell you they dont love you talk shit to their family about you get an apt behind your back and seemingly try to get with their co worker,Mentalcomposer
he doesnt really want to be with you hes just too much of a coward to break up so he does everything he can do to try to get you to break up with him so hes not the bad guy,Mentalcomposer
give him what he wants,Mentalcomposer
exactly how will it keep you busy and away from him,Mentalcomposer
is he expecting you to go outside to his car and itll take you a while to pick the lock with a bobbie pin,Mentalcomposer
locking your stuff away is a sure fire way for you to keep engaging with him,Mentalcomposer
why exactly are you with him he seems to treat you crappy,Mentalcomposer
youre missing the barbells,Mentalcomposer
your practice mistakes and stories,Mentalcomposer
nothing about this makes sense,Mentalcomposer
they include you when youre single while some of them are attached but then start excluding you when you get attached,Mentalcomposer
if it was that their partners felt threatened cause youre the young chickie  no offense to you just how older sos would view it id think the partners would be glad you found your own man,Mentalcomposer
they tell you when they got a raise or new car is it possible they are a bit salty that you as the young newish one is making the same money as them and theyve been their longer it have more experience  obviously its not your problem but they have to take their angst out on someone,Mentalcomposer
you need to speak with the ones that you were friendly with and ask what the deal is thats the only way youre gonna figure out why the sudden cold shoulder,Mentalcomposer
your partner recounted to you the horrible things you said and you dont remember saying them,Mentalcomposer
think about what you said is there any truth to it at all even a little,Mentalcomposer
you broke up once are you sure you,Mentalcomposer
both agree those issues are resolved,Mentalcomposer
think back was anything you said related to that time,Mentalcomposer
all this to say take some time and be brutally honest about if he is really the one you want to be with,Mentalcomposer
maybe this whole thing is pointing to a reevaluation,Mentalcomposer
i always wondered if a meeting with both sets of parents and both kids and a school psychologist to mediate would be helpful,Mentalcomposer
get it all out in front of everyone why do you pick on or bully or throw things or whatever and no letting the bully not answer,Mentalcomposer
i think younger kids would probably stop the behavior but middle and high school is a toss up depending on what the parents of the bully are like,Mentalcomposer
trash parents make trash kids,Mentalcomposer
if that fails then yes my kid would be learning to fight  ill give you one chance but ill be dammed if my kid is gonna be fodder for some insecure bully,Mentalcomposer
esh you both sound unorganized,Mentalcomposer
i dont mean to sound judgmental at all my first didnt sleep thru the night until maybe 9 months so i understand what youre going thru but,Mentalcomposer
why is your home always a mess,Mentalcomposer
two adults and a 6 mo old who doesnt even crawl yet never mind play with toys,Mentalcomposer
your wife didnt need to put together the high chair right that minute and how long did it take seems like it was hours,Mentalcomposer
you could have made supper while the baby sat in a playpen or a baby chair or just take the initiative and order something,Mentalcomposer
first babies are hard for the fact that youre tired youre figuring out a new normal and a new schedule,Mentalcomposer
put the baby in a baby seat or a swing or a playpen or whatever you use and go about doing what you need to do if youre cleaning the lr have them in the room with you and just chat away at them while you clean if youre making bottles bring them in the kitchen and do the same they will be fine if they fuss a bit its what they do,Mentalcomposer
as far as the formula im not even sure what your wife was upset about she had to tend to a crying baby while you went downstairs to make a bottle  maybe her job should be to make sure there are enough pre made bottles made to last thru the night,Mentalcomposer
you can then clean and make them to last thru the day,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
they are your assets and can go to whoever you want id think dan would know why he wasnt included,Mentalcomposer
if your son is old enough and has had a good relationship with his uncle before he cut off contact maybe one of your other sibs can give him dans number and your son can text him,Mentalcomposer
but be warned you dont speak to your dad your brother has turned against you do you really want your son conversing with someone who is going to talk bad about you  you dont know what dan is going to say or if your son is going to decide youre the bad guy   be careful what you wish for,Mentalcomposer
this is the only answer,Mentalcomposer
people cannot be won in a fight,Mentalcomposer
if they dont want you accept it and move on,Mentalcomposer
ywnbta,Mentalcomposer
this person has accused you of despicable things and then went  oops sorry didnt mean to totally screw with your life  cause really im sure the whole school heard the accusation lets be friends again,Mentalcomposer
how does this person even have any friends left after what they did,Mentalcomposer
nope how could you ever trust this person ever again,Mentalcomposer
id stay as far away from this person as possible,Mentalcomposer
as long as you find a dress that you absolutely love within your moms budget  and i am sure you can i would just tell mil that while you appreciate her offer you really want your mom to be the one to buy your dress its a mother daughter thing and that doesnt take away any good strong feelings toward her and you appreciate all the help she has offered for the wedding,Mentalcomposer
she should be able to understand that md bond and respect it,Mentalcomposer
also can i give 2 pieces of advice,Mentalcomposer
plan your wedding for what you and fianc want his mom might want top tier everything or every option on the menu but figure out if these are things that you really want sometimes less really is more,Mentalcomposer
go dress shopping with just your mom you will know which dress is yours its a feeling when you see yourself in it your dress shouldnt be decided by a committee too many opinions will cloud your judgement  ive watched too much say yes to the dress but i honestly believe this,Mentalcomposer
congratulations and dont stress about planning this should be a happy fun time,Mentalcomposer
how long have you been dating,Mentalcomposer
have you guys even talked about what the future would look like once the baby is here were you planning on being a couple,Mentalcomposer
look i think its unreasonable that shed choose to spend tgiving with another guy is it just the two of them or is she going to his familys holiday since i would think you two were in a committed relationship but idk her situation are you working that day does she not have family close or friends she could spend it with  did you two even talk about what you were doing for that holiday,Mentalcomposer
her idea that two guys cant hang out alone is off the wall to begin with i dont even know how shed go right to must be gay,Mentalcomposer
you need to make some decisions,Mentalcomposer
do you want to be with her,Mentalcomposer
do you just want to coparent and not be a couple,Mentalcomposer
take today to decide and then contact her to tell her what you decided youre old enough to make these decisions about whats best for you,Mentalcomposer
either way id def get a paternity test and have everything go thru the courts especially since youre military and could be moved at any time protect yourself and your rights to your child,Mentalcomposer
talk about division of chores but realize that at times things wont get done its ok if some chores like dusting or vacuuming dont get done on sat every single week itll keep,Mentalcomposer
just be flexible with almost everything youll eventually find a rhythm that will work for you both,Mentalcomposer
i think theres more to this,Mentalcomposer
what did your friend mean about making better decisions about you the pregnancy the family friend,Mentalcomposer
what would make her jump to you are gay  unless your friend texted more than what you know,Mentalcomposer
really just let her go dont even try to contact her,Mentalcomposer
if you think its your child go thru the courts for paternity testing visitation and support dont even try to work this out with her youll be in for months of crazy,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
for all the reasons everyone else posted but also because as you stated youre not even sure if your d is telling the truth,Mentalcomposer
not yours or your d place to say anything,Mentalcomposer
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,Mentalcomposer
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,Mentalcomposer
see  for more info,Mentalcomposer
him having no one to hang out with isnt your problem,Mentalcomposer
he moved to a place he knew no one thats what happens,Mentalcomposer
you broke up when you were a junior in college youve moved on and its time he did too,Mentalcomposer
but you have to tell him or hell keep trying to force his way into your life,Mentalcomposer
its not odd that he moved to your city but did he have a job lined up other friends or at least a reason other than he likes it,Mentalcomposer
hes free to live wherever he wants but it does seem like he moved to be closer to you and thats creepy,Mentalcomposer
heres the thing  you do not have to be friends or even talk to anyone you dont want to,Mentalcomposer
so if you dont want to talk to or be friends with the ex just tell him dont explain why this isnt a conversation this is you stating call him or text him  it make it short i dont want to talk to you anymore we are not friends goodbye then hang up and block him if you called,Mentalcomposer
do you just let that talk to you that way or so you answer them back,Mentalcomposer
say it firmly and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they say anything else about your food you will not be back,Mentalcomposer
i realize theyre your parents but at this point it should be more of a reciprocal adult relationship not a parent child one they should treat you accordingly,Mentalcomposer
the thing is you can never be absolutely certain that a partner is not going to cheat,Mentalcomposer
its only been 3 weeks the hurt over his cheating is in the forefront of your every thought your fear will be brought into any new relationship you have,Mentalcomposer
maybe you shouldnt be looking to date and give yourself time to just be,Mentalcomposer
eventually you will find someone who you want to be with and the fear you have now will be lessened to the point that you wont be in paranoid mode,Mentalcomposer
paranoid mode which is not at all healthy will only lead to you questioning everything your partner says everything they do and it will drive them away nobody wants to be looked at with constant suspicion for just living their life,Mentalcomposer
dont let this fear take over your life this too will pass,Mentalcomposer
sorry no,Mentalcomposer
no one needs to placate their partner to the detriment of their own well being,Mentalcomposer
your wife is insane,Mentalcomposer
divorce over an over cooked chicken sandwich  i cant even,Mentalcomposer
is she frequently this absurd have there been other issues that she goes insane over if you dont cave in to,Mentalcomposer
for me id just agree to the divorce to save myself from the crazy,Mentalcomposer
i am curious tho did she eat her whole sandwich how about the sister,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
you certainly have a very high opinion of your family dont you most times when i meet someone like you i cant quite figure out why,Mentalcomposer
the fastest way to keep them together is to make them be apart,Mentalcomposer
and really you are a grown woman and you really are entertaining the thought that your 16 yo is going to be with this guy for the long term,Mentalcomposer
we all thought that at 16 and it never does  for the majority anyway,Mentalcomposer
leave them alone your d will decide if and when shes had enough,Mentalcomposer
why doesnt he want your dads money  is there any bad blood there,Mentalcomposer
how does your dad treat your h older kids,Mentalcomposer
have you told your h that its almost insulting that he wont allow you to help shes as much your d  as his at this point,Mentalcomposer
and if its a trust then its your money not your dads no,Mentalcomposer
you can also go along with leah taking out the loans  she wont have to even start paying them back till 6 mo after she graduates at that time maybe your h will soften his stance and you can pay off the loans,Mentalcomposer
i thought i heard read that your phone does listen to what you talk about but if you turn siri off it cant,Mentalcomposer
anybody know if its true,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot of anxiousness when they leave the house in the beginning,Mentalcomposer
a lot of texts saying they arrived wherever,Mentalcomposer
then after a bit it becomes commonplace,Mentalcomposer
and youre actually glad you dont have to stay up late to pick them up from wherever they went,Mentalcomposer
go on the trip,Mentalcomposer
memories with your friends will last a lifetime,Mentalcomposer
you cannot know what the future holds you or your gf will get to uni and the distance and freedom may cause one of you to want to explore what else is out there,Mentalcomposer
why will it take him time to figure it out,Mentalcomposer
does he not read newspapers or magazines,Mentalcomposer
does he not have friends who know whats going on with them,Mentalcomposer
hell if hes so close youd think hed try to keep up with whats being put out there,Mentalcomposer
i just cant figure out what the end game was supposed to be with this display,Mentalcomposer
the connection to diana can only go so far he may have a soft spot for harry but she has been instrumental in harrys misery,Mentalcomposer
elton should sing about that,Mentalcomposer
im pretty sure this is illegal,Mentalcomposer
why would you even want to be married to someone under these circumstances  you will be putting your relationship life on hold for the foreseeable future are you really willing to not have a real relationship with someone you love,Mentalcomposer
it does not benefit your life in any way,Mentalcomposer
i say just tell her youre not comfortable with this and the answer is no,Mentalcomposer
nope  theres nothing to discuss,Mentalcomposer
in my book this is a no coming back from break up thing,Mentalcomposer
brooke sivendra royals series and the james thomas series is awesome,Mentalcomposer
anything by megan march,Mentalcomposer
christin  harber has a delta series thats pretty good,Mentalcomposer
i could be wrong but even up until the baby shower i think the perception of h and by extension m was that they were all about championing causes,Mentalcomposer
i could see the clooneys being somewhat in that circle they have a justice foundation and have a charity geared toward sudan,Mentalcomposer
now why amal was invited was probably more to do with m wanting to appear to be friends and cash in on that status but i would think amal would be a little more busy to attend,Mentalcomposer
once they realized that these two were more interested in what can be done for themselves they knew they didnt want to be involved with them,Mentalcomposer
more a case of they came they saw and ditched them,Mentalcomposer
thank you for the duomo tips,Mentalcomposer
why do you have a problem with him hanging out with his friend,Mentalcomposer
im a little confused why he needs to be home when you get home,Mentalcomposer
its his day off he can enjoy it without you  just like you can do what you want on your day off,Mentalcomposer
you dont need to be attached at the hip,Mentalcomposer
wait your bf was cheating on his ex for 6 months with you,Mentalcomposer
thats why you dont trust him to be out of your site,Mentalcomposer
i agree she did something related to the embassy that her uncle had a hand in arranging,Mentalcomposer
but bower says her dad paid for the  study programme and her sister says she wasnt employed by the embassy but was at a school attached to the embassy that arranged work study,Mentalcomposer
so really which is it,Mentalcomposer
did her dad pay for a program but what kind of program is only 56 weeks or did he fund her living arrangements,Mentalcomposer
is the sister embellishing her recollection to make mm look even more like a fool,Mentalcomposer
that being said i certainly believe whatever she was doing there had nothing to do with any diplomatic relations whatsoever so basically just another lie to try and make herself seem more important which of course backfired,Mentalcomposer
im not really seeing what it is that you need to work on,Mentalcomposer
you got a little lazy once you moved in and played games for longer than she would like   ok it happens she points it out and you adjust,Mentalcomposer
porn once and you have to tell your gf about it this is just silly if the urge strikes and you need a little help finishing why cant you do that does she have to control every orgasm you have  i dont even watch but have no issue with it,Mentalcomposer
so shes stressed if she cant handle a relationship and regular life stress at the same time it kinda seems like she needs to do some work not you,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
if shes as good a friend as you say then she would presumably already know your financial situation and she wouldnt be hurt by you not coming,Mentalcomposer
she may be disappointed that you cant be there but she shouldnt have any bad feelings toward you,Mentalcomposer
you need to get her on the phone and explain exactly what you told us here that you are upset you cant be there but its your last month of school and you just dont have the money to fly home in jan and then in feb when you have to leave the school,Mentalcomposer
ask if when you are home in feb can you celebrate her marriage see all the pics and get all the details of the day,Mentalcomposer
i hope shes understanding of your situation,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and hes cheated already,Mentalcomposer
its like he didnt even try to be faithful,Mentalcomposer
is that what you want to have in the back of your mind all the time,Mentalcomposer
you guys were friends before maybe you should go back to that before you get in too deep,Mentalcomposer
and of course dont snoop if your gut is telling you something is off trust it and confront him,Mentalcomposer
nta at all,Mentalcomposer
it doesnt matter what bil thought he was doing he was way out of line,Mentalcomposer
did no one say anything to him at the time your sis your parents  not even your husband,Mentalcomposer
what exactly would you be apologizing for not sending him his own gold plated invite  ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
and wedding invites are always addressed to the couple not each individual,Mentalcomposer
your sis and her husband can go pound sand do you even really want them there,Mentalcomposer
his reaction was way way over the top does he do that a lot,Mentalcomposer
please dont change anything on yourself because he doesnt like it,Mentalcomposer
today its eyebrows whats tomorrow going to be  weight boobs clothes,Mentalcomposer
youll get to a point where you wont even recognize yourself,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
i would think your parents would want you to go to the competition because of all the hard work youve put into it,Mentalcomposer
your sisters graduation is important but its important to her and your parents mostly,Mentalcomposer
not that you arent happy and proud for her but its not like graduation will be ruined if youre not there,Mentalcomposer
send your sis a text explaining how much this competition means to you and that its not that youre not thrilled for her but this is a one time thing for you,Mentalcomposer
signed,Mentalcomposer
the sister who didnt go to her older sisters graduation,Mentalcomposer
it also depends on your age and life circumstances,Mentalcomposer
if you live at home and are a student and its just for spending money then sure why not,Mentalcomposer
if you are supporting yourself then you have to figure out how much of that salary you actually take home and decide if its enough to live on,Mentalcomposer
since you say its a bit above min wage then maybe its not the worst job to take even if its just to get some experience or if youre in a spot where you need a job any job,Mentalcomposer
maybe one of these,Mentalcomposer
this is an argument i would have,Mentalcomposer
hes known this for 2 months and being that you scheduled this so far in advance ill assume you had to give that much notice and cant just willy nilly change your days,Mentalcomposer
im getting the feeling that you placate him more often than not and he feels entitled to dictate what he wants,Mentalcomposer
but did you tell him you were taking those days and then he decided to schedule all this private stuff,Mentalcomposer
thats the key here,Mentalcomposer
if he knew you were taking those days then hes wrong for scheduling on those same days i would tell him too bad he has to reschedule as your days were already set,Mentalcomposer
and no way i would be leaving my home for his stuff he can lock himself in a room away from where youre going to be,Mentalcomposer
i didnt even know he was in baywatch,Mentalcomposer
so i went and looked him up,Mentalcomposer
hes slightly more attractive then than he is now but still does nothing for me,Mentalcomposer
sorry i know its just me,Mentalcomposer
but him now just always looks dirty like he needs a shower,Mentalcomposer
so then tell him you cannot be with someone who is so irresponsible with money and break up,Mentalcomposer
tell him to call you when he has figured it out,Mentalcomposer
jason mamoa,Mentalcomposer
def successful and fit but hes just ugly to me,Mentalcomposer
yeah you should tell her but i wouldnt make a big thing out of it,Mentalcomposer
since youre the same age she might assume  youre gonna graduate at the same time better to know now if shes ok with this  and i cannot imagine why she wouldnt be,Mentalcomposer
youre just dating so i would think there would be a lot of conversations and do wonder why this hasnt come up before,Mentalcomposer
i think we all figured he would announce  hes already come out to moan that arizona was  taken away from lake,Mentalcomposer
im more curious to see who in the near future is going to support him and what the rnc is going to say and do,Mentalcomposer
sorry but i find it incredibly weird that you collect nudes like why,Mentalcomposer
and then to trade them like one would trade baseball cards says to me that your attitude about the girls who post or sell nudes is that they are  lesser or maybe not be deserving of respect,Mentalcomposer
you think nothing if trading some other girls pics but god forbid you send your gfs pics anywhere shes better than that gmafb,Mentalcomposer
youre not a horny teenage boy who cant control himself and needs to troll the internet for exciting pictures to get you off  youre supposed to be more mature than that but we know thats not the case dont we,Mentalcomposer
take a long hard think about that,Mentalcomposer
the absolute fact is that if he wanted to be with you more than his gf he would have broken up with her as soon as he realized that,Mentalcomposer
he hasnt so he doesnt,Mentalcomposer
he talks a big game wants to respect your values and boundaries but always trying to push them so right there i dont trust anything he says,Mentalcomposer
do you think he wont do and say the things hes doing and saying to you if you guys are dating unlikely,Mentalcomposer
dont hang out solo with him make sure you have a trusted friend with you when you hang out with him who will stop you from doing anything stupid,Mentalcomposer
are you that hung up on him or is he just nice enough and is there at this moment,Mentalcomposer
theres nothing to figure out,Mentalcomposer
you only know this guy a few months how close friends can you be,Mentalcomposer
this guy is still with his gf just the idea that he would even make a move on you shows you his character,Mentalcomposer
do you really want to be with a guy who while he has a gf is telling you hes not sure he wants to be with her while also trying to get with you,Mentalcomposer
you really have no idea what is going on with his gf he can tell you anything he wants you have no idea how to verify it,Mentalcomposer
your idea is solid he breaks up with gf he takes some time to get over her while you two stay strictly platonic friends while you figure out if you want to be with him,Mentalcomposer
dont compromise your values for anyone if they cant wait they are not worthy,Mentalcomposer
have you two ever even met in real life,Mentalcomposer
ldr is just not for you,Mentalcomposer
its perfectly ok for you to tell him you cannot continue this relationship,Mentalcomposer
wish him well and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
then b has to tell c that they have no interest and to stop asking a to set it up,Mentalcomposer
i feel like youre missing a fundamental basis of marriage which is trust you married this person so id like to think it was because you love and trust him,Mentalcomposer
apparently not because you really stretched his innocent question about tinder for his friend to thinking hes going to cheat,Mentalcomposer
seriously i cant even do the mental gymnastics it would take to get to that conclusion,Mentalcomposer
if he was going to cheat im positive he would not be asking you which dating app to use,Mentalcomposer
calm down crappy ridiculous arguments like the one you had will eventually be the death of your marriage if you continue these silly arguments,Mentalcomposer
you your husband and your marriage will be much happier if you just trust in the fact that you married each other in good faith with the idea that its forever,Mentalcomposer
stop looking for the end before its even had a chance to start,Mentalcomposer
yta,Mentalcomposer
in addition to being an absolute dirtbag and disgust me,Mentalcomposer
you obviously have no respect for your gf and only think of her in terms of what she can do for you,Mentalcomposer
i dont care how bad the construction industry is in your area you get another job any job you dont pimp out your gf,Mentalcomposer
i hope your friend tells and i hope she kicks you to the curb,Mentalcomposer
you dont deserve her,Mentalcomposer
keep that money,Mentalcomposer
it may seem trivial to you but when you were little i am sure you brought joy to that woman by just spending time with her and sharing your amusing stories,Mentalcomposer
and she showed you how much she appreciated your company by gifting you in her will,Mentalcomposer
you have to do what is best for you,Mentalcomposer
and this is not what you want anymore,Mentalcomposer
why would you  put what he wants above what you want,Mentalcomposer
first thing find a new job its ridiculous that your job is threatened just because you work for his relative,Mentalcomposer
get that straightened out first then work on an apt in the meantime save as much money as you can,Mentalcomposer
as far as being heartbroken will you really be  youre in an admittedly not healthy relationship its quite possible that you will feel relief as opposed to heartbreak,Mentalcomposer
will you miss him or will you miss the routine that you have been in  those are two very diff things,Mentalcomposer
ultimately you will be fine just the fact that you recognize that you two are not compatible is huge i would think most people would just keep going along to get along,Mentalcomposer
you know what you have to do just get it started life is too short to be stuck with someone just because,Mentalcomposer
nta for not wanting to change your schedule,Mentalcomposer
but you really should have pointed out that you were hired for 25 travel and as of now it has been 100 travel,Mentalcomposer
if i was you i would call into the person that hired me and find out what the deal is,Mentalcomposer
if they want you to permanently work in the far place which it seems they do then you have to decide if this is a job you want to keep,Mentalcomposer
nta for being livid about him quitting before having a new job but,Mentalcomposer
youre having another baby who is going to take care of this baby,Mentalcomposer
for the first one he did and you went to work maybe hes thinking it would be the same way but of course he should be working up until the baby is born to have a bit of a money cushion,Mentalcomposer
and have you thought about how youre going to handle 2 kids on your own  you will still have day care needs and someone to watch the other child before and after school and what do you do if you get deployed again  can you count on him to stay in your area after you send him packing or is he gonna run home and then youre literally in your own,Mentalcomposer
you guys need to talk about all of this your job his job your budget child care,Mentalcomposer
dont just go scorched earth until you have had this conversation,Mentalcomposer
oh gosh didnt even realize that,Mentalcomposer
caught ever other typo i think except for the one that made a funny difference,Mentalcomposer
im not sure if this is sarcastic or not,Mentalcomposer
and idk about magical rights but there are provisions for parents to give medical decision authorization to another person for either a limited time period or until the parent can be contacted,Mentalcomposer
if i take my childs friend with us on vacation their parents gives me the authorization to approve medical care if something were to happen to them while on vacation or until the parent can be contacted,Mentalcomposer
service members do the same thing if they are going to deployed or otherwise out of contact,Mentalcomposer
single people may do it if they have no family and are having a risky surgery better to designate someone who knows your wishes than leave it to an anonymous medical team,Mentalcomposer
i think he has shown you enough of what he is really like im not convinced his drinking was to numb the pain of hurting anyone that would mean he actually had any empathy which he seems to be lacking toward you,Mentalcomposer
he was the one who blew up his life and family  and i wonder why he did that since that was left out you just happened to be there so he wasnt alone,Mentalcomposer
anyone who would treat you bad while your father is right there helping you move out is absolutely not the person i would ever give another chance to,Mentalcomposer
hes obviously some years older than you let him go there are more stable less baggage guys closer to your age that you can build a solid life with why are you even trying with this one,Mentalcomposer
this is a def case of parents know best,Mentalcomposer
nta but your friend sure is,Mentalcomposer
she doesnt have to give you guardianship but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if when she cannot be contacted,Mentalcomposer
id probably get it notarized while im at it,Mentalcomposer
so theres that now as far as holding her hostage  oh no shes got that backwards,Mentalcomposer
lets look at this  her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant then they say yeah come back into the fold but without the baby,Mentalcomposer
so your friend is just having it all isnt she  she gets to dump  yes i say dump because thats exactly what shes doing the baby on you whenever she feels like going home,Mentalcomposer
and then when shes good and ready to come back she resumes care of her child,Mentalcomposer
you are a saint for agreeing to any of this,Mentalcomposer
she needs to decide is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react or is she going to pretend he doesnt exist to make her parents happy,Mentalcomposer
this baby isnt going to disappear you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents dont accept him now what makes you think that will ever change,Mentalcomposer
are you ok with that,Mentalcomposer
honestly you guys were young when you got together its possible this has just run its course,Mentalcomposer
he might realize he misses you or he might enjoy being free of commitment and enjoy being single for the first time in his adult life,Mentalcomposer
i suggest you also enjoy being single and free,Mentalcomposer
hang out with friends find ways to be ok with being single,Mentalcomposer
you shouldnt be of a mindset that this is the only guy for you most of us have felt that way but its rarely true,Mentalcomposer
spend less than you make cut out any expenses you dont absolutely need and invest the leftover,Mentalcomposer
put it in a mutual fund not individual stocks,Mentalcomposer
it may seem like such a small amount to invest but give it time once you start to see even a small increase in value it will spur you to keep at it,Mentalcomposer
once you are comfortable with the amount you can put away each month have that amount auto deposited each month from your paycheck and you wont even miss it,Mentalcomposer
it may be a slow journey but it will be worth it,Mentalcomposer
girl seriously you are a fool,Mentalcomposer
love is blind maybe but deaf dumb and stupid  no,Mentalcomposer
you moved to be with an absolute loser who cant support himself never mind helping to support a kid,Mentalcomposer
what is it about him that you cant see he is using you,Mentalcomposer
i give him credit for being there for the child if hes the only dad the child ever knew but at the same time hes not really is he,Mentalcomposer
youre the one supporting him and the child,Mentalcomposer
the exs finances have absolutely nothing to do with anything these two will figure out what they need to do about the child without any help from you stop being their atm and if they dont thats their problem,Mentalcomposer
have you ever figured out how much he is really contributing to the household you two share,Mentalcomposer
wake up and get out,Mentalcomposer
heres an article showing their mortgage payment,Mentalcomposer
according to this their mortgage is 95 million with a monthly payment of 40000,Mentalcomposer
youre still in school so there is nothing wrong with living home,Mentalcomposer
why cant she come over and hang out in your room or you can go to hers,Mentalcomposer
you can watch movies and cuddle,Mentalcomposer
no need to always be going out somewhere,Mentalcomposer
im sure she is well aware of why you live at home and why you dont have unlimited money and she still wants to hang out so dont stress so much,Mentalcomposer
could be 2 reasons,Mentalcomposer
someone on govt assistance might be easier to take advantage of since donors are paid,Mentalcomposer
or,Mentalcomposer
the payments to a donor may make them ineligible to continue on assistance,Mentalcomposer
its only been a few months and even though you talk a lot its hard to really get to know a person that way,Mentalcomposer
dont you feel that there are just some things that dont translate well over the phone  how does a person act in social settings how do they talk to their family friends and even their child are they messy or neat do they have any odd quirks that def would not mesh with your life,Mentalcomposer
and more importantly will they and their child or you and your child get along with both other people  its not enough that you like her kid so far but what if she resents moving and leaving everything she knows and comes to resent you or your son what if your son resents having strangers move in,Mentalcomposer
my advice keep doing what youre doing for a few more months then bring your son to meet them then talk to your son and have an honest conversation with him and she should have one with her kid how do they feel  if theyre ok so far have them come to you and have the same convo again,Mentalcomposer
im guessing both kids are relatively young so it is either going to be easier cause they arent as aware or harder cause to the kids you and her are their while world and they wont take well with sharing their parent,Mentalcomposer
just some things to think about but please please do not upheave either child unless everyone especially the kids are ok with it put your kids feelings before your own,Mentalcomposer
did you really not realize that marrying someone after 2 weeks wasnt going to work,Mentalcomposer
seriously if you dont mind answering,Mentalcomposer
id love to know what was going thru your head at the time as it seems a lot of military have these quick marriages,Mentalcomposer
did no one try to talk you out if it,Mentalcomposer
so its ok that your d is getting sloppy two hundred seconds because he can take care of her and give you grand babies you realize a 35 yo man who is still able to attract a 19 yo has been around the block more times than you could probably count,Mentalcomposer
but your oh so precious s is so special that he cant saddle himself with a woman who may have had previous lovers what if she can provvide for him  you do realize she can still have babies dont you,Mentalcomposer
hypocritical much,Mentalcomposer
i found this,Mentalcomposer
its a free text crisis service,Mentalcomposer
they are trained professionals,Mentalcomposer
maybe try them check them out,Mentalcomposer
go to someone at your school guidance counselor teacher there is usually someone in every school who is there for the students,Mentalcomposer
if that fails walk into a hospital and tell them you need to talk to a mental health worker,Mentalcomposer
best of luck to you,Mentalcomposer
i dont know about your scenario but if a parent was willing to do that why dont they just add your car onto their policy and you pay whatever the increase would be to your parents when the bill comes in it might be cheaper that way,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
but maybe she has some weird aversion to doing the dishes like everyone has their one household thing that they hate doing,Mentalcomposer
ask her then you can swap out a different chore that she can do instead of the dishes you do dishes and she does one that you currently do,Mentalcomposer
i do wonder tho why you even while working full time were doing all of the household chores while she was working part time,Mentalcomposer
have  you guys talked about the changes that were going to take place since youve been sick does she feel that since shes working full time she doesnt have to do anything else you know like you were doing for however long,Mentalcomposer
seems like this marriage has been unequal from the get go,Mentalcomposer
im sorry you got so sick i hope you get well enough to go back to your job it must feel awful especially being in the health fuel that the thing that was supposed to help protect you actually harmed you,Mentalcomposer
nta for trying,Mentalcomposer
your bro seems to resent your mom because of the divorce he needs to know if he doesnt already that it was your dad who forced the divorce your mom was not willing to just forgive and forget the affair so him being mad at mom is not sensible make sure there isnt more to it than that,Mentalcomposer
now if youre still gonna talk to mom you need to let her know that bro is not a baby and hes also not a very affectionate person its nothing personal to her its just the way he is  even if it is just toward her,Mentalcomposer
hes a teen boy the last thing he wants is to hug his mommy if she needs affection that badly she should find a boyfriend,Mentalcomposer
i do agree they both that they both need therapy,Mentalcomposer
what could employees of a sandwich shop possibly divulge  mayo or mustard,Mentalcomposer
i could see it not wanting to be known where they honeymooned but thats a 2 week nda at most,Mentalcomposer
these two are so over the top its absurd,Mentalcomposer
im not sure you were being selfish,Mentalcomposer
you thought of her and what she was feeling and what would be better for her instead of clinging to her because you need her as you go through a really serious time in your life,Mentalcomposer
are you sure you broke up with her because you want to be with someone who is all in for you  that would be selfish or did you do it because somewhere in your mind you know that its unfair to ask her to be your nurse maid support person and girlfriend yet again  that would be selfless,Mentalcomposer
it might seem like you made the decision for her but she probably would not have made this decision on her own how do you leave the person you love when they are literally fighting for their life the guilt would be astounding,Mentalcomposer
i wish you a full recovery and a wonderful life,Mentalcomposer
its not hate its disappointment in you and the friend,Mentalcomposer
you have been in a committed relationship for 2 years with a guy who obviously trusts you  and his friend and both of you broke that trust and for what a couple minutes of funtime,Mentalcomposer
whats best for your baby is that it is recognized by its real father so that it can grow up knowing where they came from whether that father wants to be a part of their life or not,Mentalcomposer
you cant decide paternity based on who is in a better position to raise the child or who you would rather be with,Mentalcomposer
there are multiple stories on reddit where kids found out who there real dad was later in life and their whole world was blown up do you think thats good for your child,Mentalcomposer
you know your bf best how do you think hes going to react when he finds out the whole story  maybe he wont care and will stay and raise the child with you maybe hell break up with you but either way he needs to know,Mentalcomposer
saying nothing is not the solution,Mentalcomposer
secrets will come out at some point,Mentalcomposer
there is no other advice to give you have to be an adult and fess up,Mentalcomposer
he should be able to decide if he wants to stay with a gf who cheated and also whether he wants to stay friends with the guy who would sleep with his gf,Mentalcomposer
and really his friend on a trip where the bf was there  how did that even happen where was bf when you were sleeping with his friend 3 times,Mentalcomposer
i hope its the friends baby and the bf breaks up with you and dumps his friend,Mentalcomposer
you and the friend deserve each other,Mentalcomposer
but how did she react when you pointed out you thought you werent doing gifts since she got you nothing,Mentalcomposer
its very telling if she expects you to be giving to her and she has no obligation to reciprocate,Mentalcomposer
if she is mad then thats her problem not yours shell get over it,Mentalcomposer
but have the holiday gift talk soon save yourself any future grief,Mentalcomposer
usually id say its pretty standard to get and give your so a bday gift,Mentalcomposer
but you two are young do you guys even have disposable income to be able to afford gifts,Mentalcomposer
being that your bday is before hers there should have been a simple conversation about gifts either a price limit or an agreement to not exchange at all,Mentalcomposer
heres a thought instead of gifts agree to do something for both of your bdays supper and a movie an experience you both want to do etc,Mentalcomposer
this way youre both spending the same amount of money and nobody can get their feelings hurt over something pretty trivial,Mentalcomposer
you best have this conversation before the holidays come around,Mentalcomposer
i am curious did you say to her that she didnt get you anything so you just assumed you werent exchanging gifts this year  what was her reply,Mentalcomposer
are you saying that you and your partner are still willing to hang out with them but you just want her inappropriate behavior acknowledged,Mentalcomposer
so does that mean the rest of the friend group is not willing as in does not want to hang out with them at all,Mentalcomposer
if this is the case then it is eric and amy that have lost all their friends not just you and partner,Mentalcomposer
if you watch tv while on the couch you could get up and move during every commercial walk in place walk around the house use empty gallon milk jugs refilled with water and use as barbells its not much but it makes me feel like im doing something,Mentalcomposer
you can also buy one of those foot pedal things to do while you sit there,Mentalcomposer
youd have to be watching regular tv tho so if not set a timer and do it every 10 minutes for a minute,Mentalcomposer
were there any people dancing,Mentalcomposer
did the b  g even dance to italian rap maybe they like it if they were club people maybe they wanted it that way,Mentalcomposer
i agree it does sound awful tho even if i was a club person id want to dance to something i know,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
mistakes happen but you still paid for something that you didnt get,Mentalcomposer
youre in the group chat so you should have just answered his message to everyone that you didnt realize that you didnt actually order but still paid thinking you did order and just wanted to figure out why there wasnt one for you,Mentalcomposer
and everyone didnt need to know anything about what happened why would they,Mentalcomposer
im sure you talk to some other team members and would have mentioned to them what happened you know like normal people do and the committee could care less about uniform ordering im sure,Mentalcomposer
thats why i said to explain what went on with your bro so that your parents dont have a negative idea about you which is ridiculous anyway they raised you they know who you are and what youre like why would they ignore what they see and know just because their other kid says so,Mentalcomposer
look you are probably still in school so while its great that you are interested in learning computer stuff it cannot be the only thing you do besides school explain to your parents that all learning and studying is just as unhealthy as all gaming you need balance,Mentalcomposer
just tell your parents what really happened what he said you said and explain it to them clear the air so they stop thinking of you as the problem child,Mentalcomposer
you get 50 every time you help him cant you buy your own graphics card,Mentalcomposer
your partner is not there to make you happy fulfill all your hopes and dreams and jump at your every whim,Mentalcomposer
stop sweating the small stuff work out the big things,Mentalcomposer
small  its ok if your so didnt vacuum on tuesday like they said they would itll get done at some point,Mentalcomposer
big stayed out all night and you had no idea where they were,Mentalcomposer
treat each other like you want to be treated in return its a partnership not a competition of who is the better person,Mentalcomposer
after what he said about the dishes i wouldnt wash another one ever again fuck him,Mentalcomposer
know your place you know your place and it isnt with this ah,Mentalcomposer
stop this behavior  oh yeah im stopping everything with you,Mentalcomposer
you have a job and an apt ready to go take the leap whats the absolute worst that could happen,Mentalcomposer
you need to change your mindset from scared to mad mad enough that you just say fuck it and fuck him call today and make sure you can get that apt then when he leaves for work tomorrow pack your stuff and leave,Mentalcomposer
you can leave a note but dont explain anything just say im not coming back and dont contact me then block him and get on with your life,Mentalcomposer
you can do this you did it before him and youll do it after him,Mentalcomposer
yes whatever this event is for its most likely nothing tw and her husband have done anything for  because,Mentalcomposer
they dont do anything,Mentalcomposer
so id ask what have you done for  insert event name,Mentalcomposer
and watch her try to word salad her way out of answering and then counter her answer and around and around we go until then just saying so basically you do nothing for anyone got it,Mentalcomposer
i agree its not any of the parents fault,Mentalcomposer
the kid is responsible for their actions and knows by this age right from wrong,Mentalcomposer
has the child acknowledged what they did wrong and what was the reasoning for it,Mentalcomposer
punishment should fit you took money so you earn it back to pay it back,Mentalcomposer
weekend chores around the house,Mentalcomposer
1200 is a lot of money what did they do with it,Mentalcomposer
lying is tough to punish because its more a trust issue  ie i cant trust what you say to be true idk what they lied about so these are example,Mentalcomposer
maybe once they are allowed back out with friends you make sure they can be tracked you confirm with other parents that who and where they are going is true,Mentalcomposer
if schoolwork is not being done then you arrange with the school to be informed of all assignments and you have them show you the work,Mentalcomposer
things of that nature until you can be relatively sure the lying has stopped or at least not for the big things cause the mundane stuff doesnt really matter in the scheme of things,Mentalcomposer
youve been advocating trying to help this child for a long time to no avail maybe now their parents will listen,Mentalcomposer
as the stepmom id be asking the kids dad what he was going to do about his wayward kid,Mentalcomposer
id also ask the dad to try and figure out why said child is doing these things you cant just blindly punish if you dont know whats going on with the kid,Mentalcomposer
oh and id also lock up anything of mine that has any value to it,Mentalcomposer
this,Mentalcomposer
i can sort if understand the idea that if harry comes she has to also as much as i think its ridiculous,Mentalcomposer
but lets look at them as a regular family there are some where ones spouse is not welcome to family things,Mentalcomposer
its no secret the rf has no good will left toward mm so while it may cause a bit of a stir that hed be going and not her shell be the one to save face and put out a statement saying she declined to go so at least one parent could spend archies bday with him or some other bull that makes her look not as left out,Mentalcomposer
ok thats odd then,Mentalcomposer
you need to ask him to explain what his aversion to meeting these people is,Mentalcomposer
how is he supposed to get to know them if he doesnt hang out with them,Mentalcomposer
his logic is flawed there must be another reason does he have any other friends except you  is he shy or have social anxiety  if this is the case maybe have him meet one person for a very short time and then another person until hes somewhat comfortable with hanging out with these people,Mentalcomposer
the problem i see you having is that this person it seems is withholding work related things from you because you dont agree with her opinion of mm,Mentalcomposer
if you outrank her then its time for a chat  she needs to know that regardless of her feelings about you based on your feelings of this topic the idea of withholding work related information is not acceptable and it needs to stop now,Mentalcomposer
you may want to wait to see if it happens again give her the benefit of the doubt but if it happens again then its time to take action,Mentalcomposer
it kind of sucks that shes giving you attitude and you might want to mention that too usually adults can be civil even if we disagree and this is such an insignificant thing for her to be so invested in,Mentalcomposer
but she really doesnt have to let him go does she,Mentalcomposer
he can just file and move out or share the house till its done,Mentalcomposer
its not like they both have to agree to a divorce,Mentalcomposer
now she may try to make his life a living hell try to smear him with whatever lies or truths she can get out there but after a while who is going to want to listen to her same old same old,Mentalcomposer
and maybe the rf will leak some of the more unsavory things they know about her to ruin her credibility even more,Mentalcomposer
yeah i wont read them in the hopes the dm will stop writing about these two,Mentalcomposer
i just come here to see whats new,Mentalcomposer
so thank you everyone,Mentalcomposer
it seems to me that he doesnt even have a communication style,Mentalcomposer
whats with the ignoring you nope you need to say out loud that you will not stand by and be ignored,Mentalcomposer
you ask for a hug and kiss and he just moves you aside with no explanation at all  were you offended by this did you voice that to him and he did what said nothing  and then continued to ignore you hours and days later,Mentalcomposer
why are you still there  he clearly doesnt have any problem not talking to you so give him no one to talk to,Mentalcomposer
theres a lot more going on than a diff of communication styles,Mentalcomposer
we are one of the few that actually watched and liked suits,Mentalcomposer
that said even as we watched her character was the one we always said we didnt like she added nothing to the story lines we watched for the scheming of the rest of the shows characters,Mentalcomposer
i think we should all print this article and mail it to harry,Mentalcomposer
you know in case he missed reading it,Mentalcomposer
those are really cute,Mentalcomposer
do i think its a big deal that he played longer than an hour no not really i am not a gamer at all but i can understand the idea that sometimes you cannot just put a time limit on gaming things happen in a game teams are set up and you cant just drop out etc,Mentalcomposer
and your post made it seem as if he has been prioritizing you over his gaming for the past few months which to you is great but it probably really bothered him but he was trying to keep the peace with you that is not sustainable for any relationship with any hobby or outside interest,Mentalcomposer
i think you are more upset that his hobby is gaming if his hobby was long distance cycling would you be as upset that he goes on hours long rides every day probably not because youd see that as a good hobby as opposed to gaming which i suspect you see as a bad or childish hobby but thats not for you to decide for someone else,Mentalcomposer
and sorry but your family was quite frankly absolutely in the wrong adults dont admonish other adults for their likes and dislikes we accept that people are individuals and will like what they like if i was him i wouldnt want to stay involved with you knowing how your family was so dismissive and rude,Mentalcomposer
let him be to find someone who doesnt mind his hobby or who will actively participate with him in it,Mentalcomposer
youre not the one for him,Mentalcomposer
i thought the same thing,Mentalcomposer
he wants to get you a ps5 so that he can also play on it,Mentalcomposer
id let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for your birthday,Mentalcomposer
you can buy the ps 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other,Mentalcomposer
as far as i can see your bf will do something nice for you but then needs you to do something nice for him like tit  for tat and you will do that just to make him happy yikes,Mentalcomposer
this guy wouldnt do all the dishes just his  in his mind half who does that in what world does this seem like a normal thing to do and to boot you were sick,Mentalcomposer
and then he proceeded to only do his half of the chores  uh uh no way is this ok,Mentalcomposer
seriously i dont care how long you are together he sounds like a nightmare to be with,Mentalcomposer
ill bet he never does anything for you just for the sake of doing something to make you happy but you do that for him,Mentalcomposer
this is a seriously unbalanced relationship and youre on the losing side  ask yourself why you want to be with this guy what is he adding to your life,Mentalcomposer
theres a carnival ship that leaves port canaveral on sept 21  2023 ending in barcelona on oct 4,Mentalcomposer
then on oct 28 theres a trans back from rome to tampa  nov 12,Mentalcomposer
so you can have 24 days to bop around europe and then sail back to the us,Mentalcomposer
all diff airports  and i have no idea where youre starting from but it might be something to look about,Mentalcomposer
i cant imagine she was fired because its not like she wrote the article in a vacuum,Mentalcomposer
someone higher up would have had to see the finished article and approve it for publication,Mentalcomposer
so if allyson gets put on unpaid leave the approvee would get worse,Mentalcomposer
anyone know if someone higher up at the cut is also gone,Mentalcomposer
do we think harry will even attempt to defend himself and expose what shes really like,Mentalcomposer
or is he gonna be just as spineless as he is now,Mentalcomposer
nta,Mentalcomposer
your bros relationship may not be an actual sugar baby one but are you afraid that maybe she likes him just a little bit more since he is comfortable,Mentalcomposer
im sure she likes him dont get me wrong but does she also have a career is she established in her own right,Mentalcomposer
maybe thats why youre bothered by the comments somewhere you feel shes not kidding,Mentalcomposer
i dont know if this is something you can come to as middle ground,Mentalcomposer
she has said what she needs is to be left alone to study you have to be able to do just that  leave her alone when she says she needs to study there is no middle ground there,Mentalcomposer
if your usual way of trying to be supportive is to constantly doing something for your partner then youre going to have to figure out how to not do something and reassure yourself that this is what she wants,Mentalcomposer
its going to be a long lot of years if you cant come to terms with this,Mentalcomposer
you might need to find something to do all the days shes busy youre a music major so do music  play learn a new instrument compose whatever it is that youre wanting to make as your career,Mentalcomposer
when you two are together just enjoy the time together whatever you do,Mentalcomposer
someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can know youre safe now,MLeek
id say that id have to,MLeek
it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way,MLeek
do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse,MLeek
if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner,MLeek
but to be entirely honest as a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex,MLeek
youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice,MLeek
consigned,MLeek
as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals,MLeek
a personal choice is fine and all  i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time  and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in,MLeek
no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this way with any reliability,MLeek
two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women,MLeek
young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours,MLeek
but human beings arent wolves either,MLeek
okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him,MLeek
tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect,MLeek
stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him so you choose that any sane person would,MLeek
dont tell him exactly how to fix it remind him youve given him plenty of suggestions and you now expect him to fix this problem not continue to make it yours,MLeek
if that direct talk about consequences and boundaries does not get get him moving on this within a few days start planning to be rid of him if the problem is him and hes choosing to keep those problems and make them yours too then you have to solve your real problem by getting rid of him,MLeek
hes told you he doesnt want help hes shown you his plan you can disagree but if he had a plan and hes working it you need to stop pressuring him to make a better one its his plan,MLeek
and he may be right about what the limits of the charitycouncil powers are and its not your business in the least if he doesnt want to ask his parents for help,MLeek
if hes paying his obligations to the shared home then you need to let him carry his personal burden the way he chooses too and speak for yourself speaking for yourself can look like i dont have the bandwidth the listen to these complaintsstress right now or even i find it hurtful you continue to complain at me but will not entertain any of the suggestions ive given you at all speak for your own feelings stop trying to fix the situation for him its his,MLeek
if hes not paying his agreed on share of your shared home then you need to consider that this isnt a safe person for you to live with because he expects you to carry his burdens without having to listen to you or consider your feelings or perspectives at all,MLeek
this it makes me so mad when kids are taught this was the highest of high art and was inaccessible or highbrow rj literally opens with a bunch of teenage buddies making a rape joke a rape pun but so many teachers just swan on past that,MLeek
i was confused at first too then i remembered women are always bad and always to blame,MLeek
youre probably incompatible this isnt what you want,MLeek
you can and should bring up the idea of separate bedrooms but its concerning that he doesnt seem to recognize that option,MLeek
dude the part that made this really bad sex was the part where you made it her job to take care of your feelings afterwards no hook up wants to be your therapist or your coach,MLeek
the fact you are continuing to think it would appreciate to try and demand more of her time and attention is unhinged,MLeek
go watch some educational videos on performing oral sex and with the next woman ask her what she likes and make sure she orgasms before your penis gets involved,MLeek
leave this woman alone as she has clearly told you too,MLeek
you are not owed any amount of chances she is owed the basic respect of you not contacting her anymore,MLeek
dont be a creepy demanding child if you showed up at my house in this situation id call the cops and let them explain to you that i will not be speaking with your further,MLeek
nothing but me man me use big tool go vroom,MLeek
statistically women are safer drivers by every metric on a average women are just as capable as men of spacial reasoning but they dont overrate their skills by as much take fewer risks and can more accurately assess the risks women ding cars and crack fenders men kill people,MLeek
from a pure probability pov if you want to live let a woman drive,MLeek
if you dont want to be in an open relationship its time to leave this one because that is the best case scenario the best case scenario is that he wants a transparent and ethical open relationship from there it only get worse,MLeek
dont get stressed out just admit you want monogamy just monogamy nothing else if he doesnt agree fully and directly in language you can rely on let it be over,MLeek
your bf just put you in the be my pretty lady not a human being box,MLeek
it would be slightly different if he had simply said hed prefer you not fart around him when it was avoidable  and because we are human he knows it is not perfectly avoidable  as just a personal preference the fact he connected it to being ladylike is gross and demeaning and very very stupid,MLeek
its funny they think rich men werent hoarding women before,MLeek
you know its just that less of you plebeians die young right most of you were not gonna be landed gentry you were not going to be assigned a buxom teenager you were not likely to be master or meritorious in 1020 or 1620 or 1820 either,MLeek
youre just angry you dont have a woman an assigned woman you can punch down at no matter how low you are,MLeek
i always wonder if they think small children in guatemala are just failing to manifest food and clean drinking water like if systemic issues dont exist then there are entire nations causing famine with all their negative self talk,MLeek
fit of rage is a phrase which should only ever be associated with an ex,MLeek
you dont have to be perfect to deserve not to be absurd that is a lie abusers love to tell to keep you trapped,MLeek
thank you for explaining why this might be a deterrent it seemed like a very easy hoop to jump through to me for someone with malicious intent who wanted to create a false sense of security,MLeek
i am opposed to engaging with people who exhibit a behaviour i have found to be directly connected with negatively resentment and even other controlling behaviours,MLeek
also i am woman who largely but not exclusively dates men,MLeek
in my experience men who start off with this demand quickly have other demands and accusations,MLeek
i have strategies to keep myself safe this is not one of them,MLeek
exactly the opposite i guess my strategy is too avoid men who exhibit a behaviour that doesnt make me feel safe and respected,MLeek
your husband turned you into his private porn star without telling you about it he felt entitled to doing so without your formal consent and is now demanding a formal request they be deleted,MLeek
i doubt your husband is a compete fucking moron he was aware or should have reasonably assumed that you believed the videos were deleted and that is what you wanted he should not have felt entitled to them in this way and trying to make you the bad guy who demands he give up something he never should have taken without explicit permission is revolting,MLeek
you are underreacting,MLeek
it feels like an invasion because it was,MLeek
tell him to delete them,MLeek
tell him he fucked up royally by behaving entitled to these videos without a transparent conversation at very least you should express deep disappointment with his judgment,MLeek
hes 32,MLeek
hes not confused about pets he doesnt need it explained to him this is who he wants to be the asshole who treats your dog poorly and enjoys its fear,MLeek
he sees you only as a servant to his future baby not as a person balancing her loves and needs,MLeek
and people who are jealous of pet are often jealous of babies as well,MLeek
dont keep such an open mind your brain falls right out this is exactly what it looks like,MLeek
if trust is broken dont date her,MLeek
testing her is just demeaning yourself in a shitty relationship that already isnt working,MLeek
you were manipulative you were toxic you decided to stay in a relationship you shouldnt have and used that as excuse to practice being a bad person,MLeek
i dont understand how this strategy is protecting someone from a trafficker the trafficker is usually real local people arent they it doesnt seem like it would have helped the victim in that article,MLeek
youre mistaking consequences for cant do it,MLeek
you absolutely can break a contract and if it was a legal one there might be consequences for doing so,MLeek
but scientology cannot enforce their a billionyear contract in court and you cannot use the law to force your partner back into the marital home or bed if they dont want to be there,MLeek
yeah im fine with that youd be unmatched not an issue for me what reason a person concocts at that point,MLeek
yeah ask for a facetime first and okay but ask me to buy todays newspaper or make some weird hand signs often within the first day of matching just gtfo,MLeek
i used to do it without fail these people were all bitter resentful and a bit controlling,MLeek
he knows how you feel he doesnt care he feels entitled to placing this pressure on you he thinks you should preform this way for him,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
and hes a bully,MLeek
dont stay with him,MLeek
but since youre going to anyways say this comments about my femininity skirts and makeup need to stop youve cross the line from expressing a preference to being really hurtful if you care about not hurting me you will stop if you care more about what i wear then how i feel we will break up maybe not tomorrow maybe not right away but itll happen if you dont stop hurting me,MLeek
this it has to be really extreme before i assume they were actively trying to be deceptive im bad at reading photos,MLeek
im far more annoyed by men who lie outrageously about their height ive happily dated men who are shorter than me and secure about it dont want to date a person who isnt comfortable in the height difference,MLeek
i dont know if youre joking but when someone does this to me i immediately unmatch my photos are current and authentic and i use to comply but i have never had a positive interaction when i did,MLeek
a person who comes at me from this kind of place of bitterness and control is not someone i will continue to speak with,MLeek
dating is risky and often disappointing but if all youre bringing into is distrust and anger i want none of it,MLeek
then be honest with your own needs and walk away,MLeek
i didnt mean to imply he needs to regret or feel ashamed only that people who have enjoyed casual sex in the past are still capable of choosing monogamy and being faithful in my experience they are often better at it because of the lack of fomo,MLeek
youre not compatible,MLeek
he could be just as capable of commitment and monogamy as any man who ever lived but it doesnt matter if you cannot believe that,MLeek
if youve lost trust this is over,MLeek
you should date the person in front of you not their every past choice or the person youd hope they could become you need to be able to believe what they say about their current choices and values if you cannot be happy with that person today be honest and bow out,MLeek
because freedom,MLeek
the republicans are right and royally fucked,MLeek
they have cultivated a delusional base that is not capable of selecting a candidate who can win a general,MLeek
running to trumps right is the smart way to get the nom and then to in loose the popular vote again and probably the election,MLeek
you just know this man watches nothing but hard core anal porn and pimple popping videos and is in deep denial about his desire to be pegged,MLeek
because its not about attraction,MLeek
like rape the power is the point the violation is what they want,MLeek
they are just exerting power in a public place all public spaces belong to men in this persons mind women just walk through them women in mens spaces get what they deserve,MLeek
ive a had few men try to genuinely compliment me you can tell the difference and no its not that they are chads they have said shit like cool hat awesome vibe or wish i was going to whatever party youre headed too,MLeek
its really not that hard to compliment a stranger stand still do not move into their space compliment a choice not a innate thing about their body allow the interaction to end right then easy,MLeek
i disagree with your premise,MLeek
the divorce rate doesnt speak to people who want to end it over the smallest thing most people i know who divorced worked damn hard sincerely to avoid it the people i know whove been married 10 years went through periods where they had to do that work too,MLeek
assuming every divorce is a personal failure is a lingering stigma not a reality,MLeek
and how can we say the divorce rate is high when were comparing it to a time when it was practically financially and often legally impossible to divorce not to mention the stigma do we really think marriages were twice as healthy and happy in 1950 as they were in 1990 or that they were 3x more blissful that people were really freely consenting to stay married more often even if your own family history was happy enough most of us can ask our grandmothers about the women she knew and be quickly disabused of that notion,MLeek
and why in earth do you think people who dont want to marry not marrying is a problem,MLeek
of course he did,MLeek
my ex and his family were appalled that months after he dumped me with a bit of bonus cruelty i did not come to care for him during his unexpected surgery as i had during the first eight of them you see he had thought he was healthy now so he no longer needed me he had blamed me for stalling his life but once he was in need again i was a monster for not actually putting my life on pause again to care for him,MLeek
the mind boggles,MLeek
in other words people who are less likely to want commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives are less likely to work towards commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives,MLeek
and im disagreeing it seems very obvious to me that is not many people that is a minority the majority are inclined to stay longer than they really should and keep working,MLeek
more importantly its the right outcome thats the would i want to live in if someone has one foot out the door give em a shove problem solved,MLeek
hah id say they dont actually understand consent,MLeek
they just glom on to buzzwords to try and make their positions sound modern and palatable its like when they talk about the loneliness epidemic and mens mental health stigma and youre nodding along because yes real issues but then you realize they are actually suggesting the government gift these men sex slaves to solve  the problem,MLeek
i agree the only reasons i can see to get married today is if you believe its a religious sacrament terrifying to me but ok or if being married provides better protection for the children and their rights where you live otherwise dont get it very expensive party and pointless peice of paper for me,MLeek
i cannot comprehend this attitude towards people its so objectively and observably false,MLeek
most people the vast majority keep working at preserving a relationship for months or years after it becomes objectively clear it should probably end and both parties would be happier and healthier we all know these people we have mostly been these people,MLeek
i looked back in my life and know where i should have had a zero tolerance policy lying about money throwing things in anger being mean to waiters,MLeek
healthier conflict resolution skills often contribute to relationships coming to an end because healthy approaches to adversity and conflict include fundamentally changing the terms of the relationship agreement or even ending it,MLeek
i work very hard to look like im ignoring everyone who is hollering for my attention in public i always listen very closely for a few seconds before deciding if im going to engage and usually i will not if youre asking for directions or warning about construction sure if its unclear in those few seconds what youre up too i assume its no good and keep walking,MLeek
thats nice,MLeek
legally speaking if there is going to be marriage there must be divorce without any outside authority judging whether or not the reasons are good enough anything else in unjust to everyone,MLeek
no fault is a term of art for the kind of separation youre talking about  where no one but one or both of the two people in the marriage gets to decide its over the term exists because there was a and time and place recently and currently where they wasis not the case it doesnt mean everyone is a blameless little angel,MLeek
hes certainly expressed the willingness to blame the woman when he rapes her if he sees the opportunity,MLeek
this seems to be connected to new movement in the manosphere against no fault divorce she consented to be mine and she is not entitled to withdraw that consent for any reason which means its not actually consent at all so the law is wrong when it gives her the ability to leave the marriage,MLeek
the problem with the divorce rate in their minds is the same problem as the false accusation rape hysteria they dont want women to be able to withdraw anything they interpreted as consent to their supremacy they want to trap one and not have to worry again about being worthy or of a partnership,MLeek
this guy knows with 100 certainty that no woman has ever enjoyed herself with him and never will,MLeek
motherhood is the best thing when it serves them personally or their political goals,MLeek
the like motherhood as an ideal not as an occupation that might not directly benefit them,MLeek
the fact that an actual person they have to interact with may be doing the work of being a parent while female is inherently distasteful,MLeek
i think it should be a goal daily on a personal level  ignore them live your life,MLeek
but beyond the personal sphere we cannot afford to ignore them not only do the extreme members try to kill us with guns and with legislation but the shepherds are leading more and more young men to the slaughter on a societal and political level they cannot be ignored they want women subjugated and their strategy relies are making more and more men desperate entitled ill or angry enough to support that cause  on the false promise that access to an unhappy subjugated women will make them happy and that they will all of course be found deserving and meritorious by the new patriarchy,MLeek
its a bad habit and she needs to stop,MLeek
could it mean shes not over him sure but a bit more likely is that shes picking at the scab rerunning conversations in her head and basically letting this wound fester,MLeek
she cant build a new healthy relationship unless she recognizes this behaviour is selfdestructive just cause lots of people do it especially just every once in a while and not weekly doesnt mean it okay,MLeek
in the end id be more concerned that its been two years and they havent formalized the divorce,MLeek
you need to go see what you can swing with work,MLeek
look that kind of response is unkind its not crazy for your partner to ask you to commit to spending some vacation time with them or to ask you to confirm those plans in june for july you may not mean to be jerking her around or telling her shes not a priority or embarrassing her in front of her friends but the result of that kind of response can rationally be all those things,MLeek
if you cannot take vacation then figure out when you can and calendarize it now,MLeek
youre working too much regardless of what else is going on here in this relationship your work life balance sounds like complete shit right now and a reasonable partner will become frustrated by that,MLeek
ask him what his plan is for his agreed on portion of the bills are if he is out of working for a month or 3 months or more,MLeek
thats the question you need to ask him and make it clear you have not agreed to covering all the finances for an indeterminate length of time he needs a plan to meet his obligations he needs to communicate that plan to you,MLeek
stop trying to fix the job search issue for him start expecting him to address your very reasonable fears and boundaries like a reasonable person,MLeek
its not your job to find him a job,MLeek
its his his to explain to you how he is going to meet his responsibilities once this contract ends its not totally crazy to be looking forward to job searching after his contact ends but if that is his plan he needs to tell you he has enough cushion to make it happen you are not his safety net you just moved in together that is not a kind or reasonable expectation of you,MLeek
i didnt want a better life for the women,MLeek
just tell him the truth its not working for you,MLeek
this daily texting is awkward and confusing you dont want to continue it you cant build a serious connection like this its hard to even build a friendship tell him you want to stop wish him well,MLeek
block him when he doesnt reply with grace,MLeek
its not fair,MLeek
its obviously abusive behaviour,MLeek
youre not in an ethically nonmonogamous relationships youre in an emotionally abusive one,MLeek
i honestly dont know how women have sex with men in some states these days at all i love sex but it seems unnecessarily risky,MLeek
but at least now you know he wasnt getting better he just has a little while where he had fewer reasons to be utter shit now he has a new  reason to be a selfish abusive peace of shit and hes going all in on it,MLeek
you dont need a perfect excuse but his transparent attempts to bully manipulate and shame you into silencing your own feelings and needs are pretty damn perfect as valid reasons to dump a person goes,MLeek
hes gonna call you selfish and stubborn if you were paying his rent and donating a kidney he just wants to get his way it has nothing to do with reality,MLeek
one of my few boundaries in my open relationship is that neither of us sleep with who is not prochoice even though protection is always used as well,MLeek
i may stay in the relationship with someone else being pregnant but i wouldnt try to force a polycule or triad because she got pregnant the two of them may have a relationship as coparents and that would remain separate from my relationship as partner or friend with either of them,MLeek
but you really shouldnt stay in this relationship,MLeek
he is manipulative and emotionally abusive and if he actually uttered the words small inconvenience to refer to his own child i might take a baseball bat to his bits before i go,MLeek
there is nothing here but to live and learn,MLeek
people are more than just toys or experiences they are people first and foremost dont think because youre less experience its okay to treat someone who isnt openly transparently consenting like a toy or a fun ride its still really important to talk about what you want dont make assumptions about what they want or feel,MLeek
even if you had watched the movie he may still have ended up connecting with and choosing someone else so dont follow that road in your head to silly places,MLeek
its totally normal and healthy to have fantasies but stop fixating on this guy,MLeek
just keep dating,MLeek
use your experience to inform your future choices,MLeek
this is just not a person to engage with the rest is unknowable you can know you were right to get away from her,MLeek
there is nothing to learn here except that you were right eventually good for you,MLeek
but the term youre looking for is serial monogamist or even cowardly little shit sociopath is a stretch based on what youve given here and monkey brancher is from incelpua land with their notoriously terrible understanding of evolutionary psychology if you dont want to be associated with misogyny dont use their buzzwords you can be plenty angry with one shitty person who happens to be a woman without buying into the resentful bullshit that will damage your relationships with all women,MLeek
file this under shitty person is shitty and move on closure happens when you stop caring why shitty is shitty and just be glad to be staying away from it,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
also pair bonding is just a profound misunderstanding misogynists have about birds that they have used as an excuse to shame women if anything human beings can actually get better at forming intimate relationships with more healthy practice at it,MLeek
but that doesnt matter here youre not compatible with her and thats okay you dont trust her dont date someone you dont trust also dont be a controlling twat but that is a seperate issue it just has nothing to do with her cognitive or neurochemical ability to create and maintain partnerships in her own life,MLeek
a yellow flag but not a red one,MLeek
at three months you should be a little bit skeptical of anyones report of their crazyabuse ex,MLeek
but reactive abuse is a very real thing the key word is react people are not at thier best when facing frequent abuse they snap they lash out they do crazy toxic things in reaction to being abused,MLeek
mutual abuse is rare,MLeek
reactive abuse is common and lots of abusers try to push their victims to react so they can blameshift and gaslight the victim into thinking its their fault,MLeek
keep your eyes and ears open but no not an immediate red flag,MLeek
improve first then communicate to him the exact steps you are taking,MLeek
telling him before youve even started the work will feel like youre making an excuse like youre asking him to tolerate it or worse solve it for you and even worse still that might actually be on some level what youre trying to do  get his acceptance and validation make excuses not changes,MLeek
so change first do the soul searching pick some strategies identify a few small steps you need to take and maybe one or two big ones maybe book a session or two with a counsellor then share with him what you are doing to solve your problem,MLeek
no,MLeek
the two things arent related in that way,MLeek
the national pp federation is restructuring to support statelevel decision making better and to developing more telehealth the former ceo was there for 12 years new one has been in place for about 3 i dont think anyone who understands ngo life cycle would find this all that shocking sad for the individuals involved absolutely also totally sane leadership,MLeek
wont lie to you that was all pretty damn bad,MLeek
the point now is to get your head on straight so you dont make similar mistakes when youre hurting or in pain in the future thats the best way to make amends and to rebuild your trust in yourself,MLeek
get back to the hustle and get your financial independence back,MLeek
and dont be so hard on yourself,MLeek
you entered into an arrangement with someone you knew was paying you for sex like a lot of young people you came to realize just what that all meant it would have been rational to assume she was paying others as well looking back you can probably identify some places where you should have said no thank you or suggested she work with another trainer but she was probably far more skilled at pushing past boundaries than you were at expressing them,MLeek
get yourself out safely and rebuild and maybe an sti check crash on a friends couch for a bit if you need too there is nothing wrong with you its a learning experience about setting boundaries listening to your own instincts and avoiding manipulators its one a frightening number of women of all races go through and youll make it through it too,MLeek
i keep on validating disapointment and saddness,MLeek
you keep saying you get it but then immediately insisting on more angry assumptions and accusations of wrongdoing against her so you dont seem to be getting the discretion,MLeek
good luck,MLeek
youre becoming absurd in an attempt to hold on to your anger with her and find wrongdoing,MLeek
you met her in midmarch its now almost the end of may thats a very normal range of time for people to connect sincerely but for ones to realize its not going to work out,MLeek
yes that was unkind but shes entitled to her belief and if she doesnt believe he can handle it then shes right to end it regardless of what he thinks of his own capacity i do not trust youre capable of meeting my needs,MLeek
would be more accurate but its the same thing and valid its suboptimal phrasing but she appears to have owned her choices no problem,MLeek
but seriously his behaviour here is reminding me why 29 is my absolute floor im inclined to agree with her assessment,MLeek
most people experience validation from relationships of all kinds,MLeek
youre looking for a reason to make her the bad guy because she disappointed you but you dont have a good one she just disappointed you because she didnt want what you wanted,MLeek
the assumption she didnt tell you just about as soon as she figured it out herself is the bitter and entitled bullshit i mean those are the kinds of negative thoughts you need to stop indulging in,MLeek
while i think its inappropriate he didnt tell you if he never replied its not that weird that he kept it to himself,MLeek
a lot of people especially men do not like to admit they are being harassed and it is harassment it may be lowkey but it is that,MLeek
i dont block the man who sends me these sorts of texts because a i worry if he realizes hes blocked he may escalate and b i want to have a record of the behaviour in case he ever does escalate its not a comfortable thing to tell a new partner about but i always do,MLeek
yeah but youre letting these thoughts fester we all have passing thoughts after a break up that are are negative and irrational you have to let them go not ponder them further,MLeek
they wont support you being happy or kind in the future so drop that bullshit,MLeek
be disappointed not irrationally bitter and entitled,MLeek
you werent lied too,MLeek
you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you,MLeek
the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women,MLeek
this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm,MLeek
so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly,MLeek
and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying,MLeek
she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal,MLeek
that was successful communication you had a good time for a while you had some basic compatibility but once she knew it wasnt for her she told you,MLeek
maybe the problem isnt your income or the age range maybe the problem is you need to learn to handle rejection most connections with anyone of any age are gonna just not quite work out,MLeek
just stop texting him entirely,MLeek
you rejected him when you rejected his intensity and talk about future wifey that was rejecting him you didnt want what he wanted and thats okay it was the right thing to do,MLeek
let it be a rejection and let it be over,MLeek
then your marriage is over,MLeek
youve decided it,MLeek
youre just trying to bully her into being the one who says it out loud it may take years but eventually she will and youll tell yourself your hands are clean but they are not,MLeek
what you are doing is cowardly and manipulative at least as shitty as anything youve accused her of here,MLeek
if you actually want to be married stop this bullshit and go talk to a counsellor together,MLeek
youre the one who described actively threatening the relationship,MLeek
whats worse you dont even mean it you dont want to divorce right so youre just being manipulative and hurtful when you speak that way to her at least shes being honest with you about her unhappiness,MLeek
so why dont you shit or get off the pot stop making it all her job to leave your ass,MLeek
the rank hypocrisy is shocking you sound like a teenager not a 35yearold,MLeek
either get a marriage counsellor involved to help you both do better you yes you really need to do a lot better than this or stop being such a little shit and hire a lawyer yourself,MLeek
just let him avoid you its fine for him to avoid you,MLeek
this is resolved just fine,MLeek
stop trying to pursue the fwbcasual fling with him he is not equippedinterested in that dont get bent outta shape that a 22yearold cant explain his boundaries and emotional needs clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him,MLeek
the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself,MLeek
then you earned every downvote,MLeek
everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct,MLeek
edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic,MLeek
that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you,MLeek
if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas,MLeek
dont just vaguely demand someone else spell it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless,MLeek
that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this,MLeek
if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this,MLeek
does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural,MLeek
if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure,MLeek
i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay,MLeek
if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly,MLeek
no this is a terrible idea,MLeek
shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship,MLeek
tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning,MLeek
i didnt say there werent many good things,MLeek
but look at what this bad thing is cause its a fricking huge one,MLeek
1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns,MLeek
2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening,MLeek
3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life,MLeek
its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase,MLeek
you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you,MLeek
its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place,MLeek
the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping,MLeek
its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue,MLeek
the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30,MLeek
its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers,MLeek
in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that,MLeek
but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt,MLeek
dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing,MLeek
are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself,MLeek
you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your bpd,MLeek
no,MLeek
id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing,MLeek
but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right,MLeek
you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her,MLeek
nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it,MLeek
the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life,MLeek
youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming,MLeek
right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time,MLeek
once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or so of moving cut him loose,MLeek
you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved,MLeek
absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still,MLeek
however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are,MLeek
but if you look at all the posts  not just the juicy ones  most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool,MLeek
this is totally old school analogue behaviour  the whisper network  in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women,MLeek
a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser,MLeek
you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s,MLeek
we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another,MLeek
this man isnt going to save you,MLeek
he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner,MLeek
on top of all of that you dont trust him he lies,MLeek
this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself,MLeek
ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end,MLeek
it happened last summer in ohio,MLeek
her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law,MLeek
women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants,MLeek
i love these she dumped me for no reason stories,MLeek
one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like,MLeek
he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home,MLeek
but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested,MLeek
i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up,MLeek
i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments,MLeek
i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times,MLeek
even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it,MLeek
oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety  totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development,MLeek
notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men,MLeek
its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy,MLeek
the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him,MLeek
that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much,MLeek
i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better  but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her,MLeek
exactly this,MLeek
he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him,MLeek
op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him,MLeek
ops response was imperfect  shes a great target for his style of bullshit  but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her,MLeek
he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her,MLeek
and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her into silence,MLeek
classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man,MLeek
only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op,MLeek
fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes,MLeek
but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles,MLeek
when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats,MLeek
maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out,MLeek
major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag,MLeek
he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel,MLeek
hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life,MLeek
its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that,MLeek
some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal,MLeek
this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons,MLeek
thats worse all of that is worse,MLeek
he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose,MLeek
it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you,MLeek
this is so much worse,MLeek
her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice,MLeek
him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void,MLeek
hes not confused,MLeek
hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone,MLeek
hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say,MLeek
and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped,MLeek
id walk,MLeek
this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont,MLeek
but im his age,MLeek
and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era,MLeek
a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either,MLeek
4 year olds when they are called kiddo,MLeek
24 year olds when they are called kiddo,MLeek
me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis,MLeek
me when my catty sil does,MLeek
its almost like context and intent matter in human communication,MLeek
this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you,MLeek
i would consider the friendship done,MLeek
his behaviour was horrible and your response was not productive but it doesnt really matter,MLeek
generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle,MLeek
it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant,MLeek
there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is,MLeek
let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic,MLeek
best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging this performance,MLeek
its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood,MLeek
theres no going back there is not much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama,MLeek
allow it to end grieve it out and move on,MLeek
your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you,MLeek
your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her,MLeek
just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement,MLeek
speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory,MLeek
document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself,MLeek
youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years,MLeek
you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence,MLeek
you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries,MLeek
you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative,MLeek
youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys,MLeek
expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them,MLeek
leave him blocked youve communicated clearly,MLeek
you can divorce someone for any reason youd like,MLeek
but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not,MLeek
but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall,MLeek
it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good,MLeek
most of us loved this before it was branded psl,MLeek
in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette,MLeek
your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure,MLeek
you need to work on your insecurities in therapy,MLeek
what he said was careless not an insult he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard,MLeek
and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy,MLeek
you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating,MLeek
shitty things be shitty,MLeek
sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part,MLeek
first ask her what support she wantsneeds,MLeek
second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true  the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time,MLeek
some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it,MLeek
do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel  she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out,MLeek
keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support,MLeek
dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind,MLeek
to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju,MLeek
also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters,MLeek
from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second,MLeek
oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth,MLeek
i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like,MLeek
you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office  especially if she intends to get personal tax benefits or write offs for it  then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying,MLeek
and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself,MLeek
i wouldnt want to be married to either of you,MLeek
yelling is unacceptable to me,MLeek
however so are constant accusations especially public drunken ones,MLeek
what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband,MLeek
most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours,MLeek
stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him,MLeek
if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket,MLeek
youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget before you agreed to go,MLeek
if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend,MLeek
i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him,MLeek
even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her,MLeek
so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments,MLeek
youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up,MLeek
youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too,MLeek
hes doing exactly what he wants,MLeek
if he wanted to be at those appointments he would be,MLeek
if he wanted to be dating you he would be,MLeek
he doesnt,MLeek
and he probably never will,MLeek
stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent,MLeek
agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner,MLeek
same answer hes not your partner,MLeek
its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this,MLeek
the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being,MLeek
im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be,MLeek
i just dont want to break up with him,MLeek
its a situationship by definition you are not together,MLeek
we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter,MLeek
great you need to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another,MLeek
i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre,MLeek
you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that,MLeek
dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps,MLeek
you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable,MLeek
it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it,MLeek
got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i even got around to it,MLeek
you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience,MLeek
i think you feel like a single mom because you are one,MLeek
stop the situationship just be coparents,MLeek
hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one,MLeek
the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being,MLeek
let it go and focus on being coparents,MLeek
she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest,MLeek
go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex,MLeek
you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices,MLeek
you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children,MLeek
if it doesnt matter where you live then you live near were your children are right now that is the default,MLeek
i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions,MLeek
but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer,MLeek
he definitely wants to fix it,MLeek
if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll continue to tolerate it,MLeek
youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother,MLeek
he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you,MLeek
he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner,MLeek
you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you,MLeek
this was my ex too,MLeek
i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head,MLeek
he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand,MLeek
i wouldnt i would text him after i post it,MLeek
conversation can evolve from there or not,MLeek
make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest,MLeek
id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn,MLeek
the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack,MLeek
you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt,MLeek
try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you,MLeek
if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal,MLeek
go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact,MLeek
its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage,MLeek
tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live,MLeek
a few times ive given advice like thats not something you can reasonably expect from a matchhook up youre looking for a very specific service and you should be hiring someone and tipping well and completely been oblivious to the fact i was suggesting a crime,MLeek
you cannot control how he feels,MLeek
you can tell him youre concerned thats fair but dont get into specifics,MLeek
youre concerned hes stressed out and overworked youre concerned he wont accept advice or listen to doctors on the best way to manage his pain or his diet,MLeek
dont assume you have the answers dont be your mothers little helper speak for yourself and admit youre worried you want better for him than he seems to be choosing for himself and as someone who loves him that makes you sad,MLeek
youre a piggy bank for a man who hid his child from you for four months,MLeek
the fact hes an unreliable dad isnt something you can fix for him,MLeek
being a reliable parent means showing up he cannot do that without the financial support of the new gf he lied to,MLeek
you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life,MLeek
but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister,MLeek
that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this,MLeek
your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids,MLeek
you cannot fix crazy,MLeek
your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy,MLeek
and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really,MLeek
your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks such irrational and hateful things about you from your life,MLeek
you need to stop seek therapy,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else,MLeek
it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here,MLeek
he connected more with someone else,MLeek
its just a rejection its a normal part of dating,MLeek
the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist,MLeek
stop supporting and start laying down some expectations,MLeek
if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind,MLeek
that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling,MLeek
you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings,MLeek
stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs in order to perform and set goals yuck,MLeek
but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children,MLeek
shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery,MLeek
also shes way too old to be this much of a brat,MLeek
dont do this,MLeek
use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface,MLeek
whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way,MLeek
if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all,MLeek
hes not a faithful man he never has been,MLeek
can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you,MLeek
you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it,MLeek
youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this one,MLeek
nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated,MLeek
yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense,MLeek
it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways  with legitimate anger or clear boundaries  that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us,MLeek
this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser,MLeek
it doesnt get better for op until op gets out,MLeek
youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer,MLeek
this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner,MLeek
at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same,MLeek
hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice,MLeek
just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama,MLeek
so all these people like each other more than they like you,MLeek
which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in,MLeek
its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them,MLeek
the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead,MLeek
if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit,MLeek
id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things,MLeek
hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue,MLeek
you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be dealbreakers,MLeek
emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements,MLeek
yeah i dont get it,MLeek
my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable,MLeek
yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves,MLeek
that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully,MLeek
and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know,MLeek
i dont think youre being the critical thinker you imagine you are,MLeek
but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out,MLeek
your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did,MLeek
all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes,MLeek
you really should consider why your story  the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her  is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap,MLeek
the devil has plenty of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner,MLeek
why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him,MLeek
and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere,MLeek
its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable,MLeek
no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive,MLeek
op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap,MLeek
it does to me,MLeek
but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals,MLeek
unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes,MLeek
id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up,MLeek
not because your feelings are irrational but because grief  especially grief and processing after long term abuse  are super fucking complicated,MLeek
you can ask her to do this work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people,MLeek
shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life,MLeek
you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in,MLeek
your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations,MLeek
becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is,MLeek
becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute,MLeek
laugh,MLeek
and then hopefully wake up from the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog,MLeek
we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard,MLeek
look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit,MLeek
ive happily agreed they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why,MLeek
friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves,MLeek
they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake,MLeek
while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes,MLeek
does it matter,MLeek
most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time,MLeek
and,MLeek
i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me,MLeek
this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material,MLeek
unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off,MLeek
dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too  and then put this one back on the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy,MLeek
i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together,MLeek
basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo,MLeek
no you probably shouldnt,MLeek
you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life,MLeek
you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you,MLeek
youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform,MLeek
youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt have to agree she doesnt agree,MLeek
these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has,MLeek
take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife,MLeek
your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass,MLeek
dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal,MLeek
tell your mother kindly but firmly that your invites do not include him unless you explicitly include him you need to avoid these misunderstandings in the future by being clear if he is coming or not,MLeek
even if he isnt cheating on you this isnt okay,MLeek
if hes not cheating on you then hes trying to punish you for forgetting to pay your bill during your time of crisis and grief,MLeek
you dont need proof hes cheating to get the fuck rid of him over this,MLeek
a person who tells you they are sooooooo nice and sooooooo loyal and no one else will treat you as well as they will is a completely trash person,MLeek
do not make peace with this,MLeek
do not marry this man,MLeek
this is a major warning sign,MLeek
he will abuse you,MLeek
then he will tell you its your own fault while declaring all other men are worse abusers than he is which is a lie he tells so he gets what he wants he wants to abuse you,MLeek
why not just block him thats perfectly acceptable and very clear response,MLeek
and if not that then you tell him to stop,MLeek
dude that sounds flirty i dont like it cut it out,MLeek
if he denies it or pretends its not or its no big deal dont argue with him just say good im glad thats not what you meant cut it out anyways i dont like it thanks,MLeek
its a bad idea to date someone in their 20s,MLeek
the age gap should bother you more than it bothers her and it should motivate you to make a responsible respectful choice based on your life experience,MLeek
to answer your questions generally i think dealbreakers prior the first date should be short and sweet and cover the really big things guns religion sex before marriage and abortion vegan diets if that is a big one for you those sorts of biggies the conversation about what could a relationship look like how much time will we spend together and where how do you see a relationship with your children developing is a conversation you have after 23 pleasant dates and you both agree you want to continue to see one another,MLeek
i mean it sounds like the guy is a sexist asshat you should reduce your time with,MLeek
its okay to decide not to invest in friendships with people if you dont like how they treat you or others,MLeek
stop being a bystander its gross if youre not going to call him out at least step away from him,MLeek
youre not,MLeek
you are not 5yearolds call dibs on the best ball as the bell rings,MLeek
you treated her like a human being,MLeek
hes treating you like a competitor in a sport where she is the favourite big red ball and he cant figure out how to dibs her,MLeek
keep her friendship reconsider his,MLeek
she wasnt that into you,MLeek
you were into her and kept hopingimagining she felt the same,MLeek
maybe she kinda liked you at some point but then she didnt,MLeek
there is no problem here just a normal disappointment,MLeek
the only thing youre doing wrong is refusing to accept this as a totally normal bit of normal human disappointment most of the people you like arent gonna like you back,MLeek
youre both being absurd and kinda gross,MLeek
this woman has told you shes not available for new connections at the moment,MLeek
he doesnt give a fuck he thinks this is a game to be won not a bunch of human people with feelings and free choices and youre acting like he bought her by driving you around and being your friend that is also pretty gross,MLeek
opt out of this bullshit when he makes passiveaggressive comments tell him hes being kinda unfriendly over this shit and to cut it out be a bro not a whiny brat you value his friendship but if hes gonna act like a 5th grader who called dibs on a girl who told him she isnt single anyways its gonna damage respect between you two as adult human beings,MLeek
if you dont want to keep speaking her then dont but this isnt about who falls in love more this is about not surrounding yourself with men who treat women as trophies and you as the competition its toxic af its not friendly,MLeek
when i see no drama my brain immediately translates it to i am the drama i bring the only permissible drama,MLeek
no drama is the poor cousin of all my exes are crazy i wouldnt say is guarantees gaslighting  that term is getting super inflated but it does mean they seek out and create toxic dynamics and at very best lack selfawareness,MLeek
yeah,MLeek
and you wont die cause you cant afford insulin or chemo or got in a car crash and your family wont loose the house andor all their savings trying to keep you alive,MLeek
everyone on the planet who gets this deal would fucking go to war against the us if they tried to export your the idea of a tiny bit less taxes but everything else is way fucking worse and only the millionaires benefit,MLeek
i literally do not know how so many americans wake up each day knowing they are one er visit away from total financial ruin,MLeek
tell me youre an adult man who wants a mommy without te nm fuck it,MLeek
you are loved and awesome,MLeek
he was telling a story telling a lie because his ego couldnt accept the rejection he couldnt handle the consequences for his bad behaviour he needed to tell a story where you unworthy of him so he didnt have ti address the fact he was clearly objectively unworthy of you,MLeek
its been years since i broke up with my ex and some of his nasty stories about me still slip into my life telling me im unworthy or im greedy or im dumb im shocked how many years later im fighting his narratives even though they were lies then and they are definitely lies now,MLeek
your brain it trying to make sense of someone you cared for and were vulnerable with telling you such terrible lies,MLeek
you end all contact you keep reminding yourself these were selfserving lies that had everything to do with his weakness and hatefulness and nothing to do with you as a person,MLeek
honestly the best thing to do is leave these conversations i tell them to google motivated reasoning and then go touch grass,MLeek
its not a data argument to begin with no data scientist would take these with anything short of a 10lb bag of street salt thats not even what average means this was a dataasmarketing for paid dating apps a decade ago apps that are selling a product to predominately straight men by convincing them they require a paid advantage,MLeek
marketing departments make graphs all the time that i roll my eyes at and say well that is technically not a lie thats all that is happening here,MLeek
are we talking oh that 18 year old has great emotional regulation expresses boundaries clearly while also being empathetic to those around her,MLeek
or do we mean shes a free baby sitter and chauffeur for younger siblings and isnt thats a great perk for her parents,MLeek
there are definitely ways to praise young women for being mature or wise that reflect their individual strengths and not their usefulnesssubmission to others,MLeek
irrelevant,MLeek
this would be a bit funny from a 21 one year old but its embarrassingly stupid from a man his age who wants to be a parent,MLeek
if ubi does happen ha and ai takes over significant parts of our world school will change a lot but children will still need to be educated in order to be people we want to share the world with and maybe even live fulfilling lives,MLeek
its pretty obvious this man just wanted you to shame her into handing the child over to you and then you would be responsible for the care of him and the child,MLeek
glad you escaped id suggest you be very very skeptical of anything he ever told you about her whatever her struggles are now clearly when they were together she had two babies to take care of and one of them was a resentful and manipulative shit of a 450months old,MLeek
i would not date a man who thought it was my job to sort out his parenting and custody issues with his ex thats insane,MLeek
he was being a shitty parent and trying to coerce you into doing the job for him this terrible attitude towards responsibility and work likely his assumptions about womens work was going to continue,MLeek
if he had won custody youd have basically been single parenting that infant can all but promise it breaking up over his lack of responsibility and blameshifting was completely wise and not at all petty,MLeek
then start with your obygn or a standard therapist and ask for a referral,MLeek
if youre serious about these concerns address them seriously addressing them seriously is not going to happen on reddit,MLeek
33 isnt an older father those studies usually begin at 35 to 40,MLeek
you should be talking to a doctor not google not reddit and not a sociopath,MLeek
i think trying to round your hall pass up into polyamoury before speaking to your wife is toxic as fuck swinging is completely and utterly different from poly most swingers will be the very first to tell you that  and makes me perfectly comfortable expecting better from this man hes not a novice he should have the basics down so trying to build a new relationship outside of the marriage for weeks without speaking to his wife thats taking it past poor communication about boundaries into a realm id consider manipulative and coercive,MLeek
i say this as a practicing enm person who has seen a lot of wellintentioned people mess it up this is not a mess up i could assume was wellintentioned experience has taught me that people who really want to take good care of all their partners and relationships arent this stupid this mess up would mean both of these people are outta my life forever they are not safe or reliable,MLeek
im not a fan of keeping such an open mind that ones brain falls right out the best ill give this man he was very conveniently confused and when someones confusion is that convenient to them and what they want for themselves trust is severely damaged,MLeek
if i heard hall pass id assume it was a onetime hook up thing so yeah hit it and quit it and i probably wouldnt want to participate in that sounds dicey and not what id want in an enm encounter,MLeek
but i really dont know what a hall pass was in this marriage and neither does op and apparently neither did these two thats kind of the whole problem and its not ops problem,MLeek
so this chad was a sorta awkward and totally ageappropriate teenage boyfriend right,MLeek
no one dates someone 20 years younger then them by accident or because they are looking for a relationship with and equal rooted in mutual respect,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
you dont seem to be open to advice,MLeek
its reasonable for your gf to not want to marry you and live with your mom its reasonable for her not to want to marry someone who is planning on financially supporting his mother for the rest of her life,MLeek
it is strange that you find this surprising and its only coming up now,MLeek
this isnt insecure  a bit sexist maybe but not insecure this is a reasonable boundary you should halt all plans and probably break up if you plan on financially supporting or living with your mother for the rest of her life,MLeek
outside of very conservative upbringings very few women are going to sign up to marry you under those terms,MLeek
no absolutely not you are not required to make yourself of service to this messy toxic man or his wife you are completely correct this is not yours to fix why are you still in contact with either of them there is nothing for you to gain from that,MLeek
this is not your circus not your monkeys if he violated their relationship agreement that is the two of them to sort out it has nothing to do with you,MLeek
if you feel like you want to do her this huge emotional service and massive favour invite her to contact you via email with her questions and you stick to factual responses ie not about what you felt but about timelines and what information you received when,MLeek
but even that i would not do if these two are at war with one another there is no good outcome for you if you go wandering out in the middle of the battlefield id advise you to end contact entirely with both of them,MLeek
i mean this with respect and compassion but you need to go touch grass,MLeek
youre giving over way too much of yourself to this and twisting this into stories just to get down on yourself stop trying to place those highschool pickme dramas into this thats not whats going on here,MLeek
your hurt feelings over this make sense for a few minutes but this is all a bit much dont wallow dont fixate she wasnt into you she probably wasnt into you for something causal either let it go,MLeek
a woman who plans to have somewhere to be after the date doesnt plan to have sex with you be sure this all adds up to not that into you,MLeek
honestly women in their 40s are well aware of that stigma and they will tell you if they are into something casual with you if she did not odd are very good she was not,MLeek
you need to relax and let them know which dishes you need to access and that you are not able to reach x y and z in the position they were moved too ask they be moved back or that you take a look together,MLeek
youll be fine its fine to ask for things you use frequently to be stored at a height you can access safely,MLeek
you can feel how you feel but she didnt do anything wrong,MLeek
you know this is about your insecurities and instead of taking it so personally you should be taking this as clarity she was correct you were not compatible as dating partners you were not looking for the same thing,MLeek
if you really want to be her friend then you can mention to her that he considers himself redpilled and suggest she google what that means before she wastes too much energy,MLeek
but you also dont have to be friends if youre not happy being her friend which may involve being aware or even seeing her connect with someone else,MLeek
you dont trust him dont fuck someone you dont trust,MLeek
its not complicated youre not as compatible as you had previously thought you were just end it,MLeek
two hours on the phone is a long time for adults with full lives,MLeek
if youre doing that several times a week im not surprised shes not on the whole time and that its not that satisfying,MLeek
ldrs are tough but you need to focus on the kinds of connection and length that fuels that relationship not the kind that just checks the box of we talked today,MLeek
you mean your exboyfriend right,MLeek
this is not rocky this is risky,MLeek
this is not just disrespectful behaviour its dangerous,MLeek
this is not about him getting off even this is about him taking sexual pleasure in deceit and violation of you and of other women,MLeek
this isnt about you or your body this is about the fact he likes lying and ripping women down generally this is what he does this is who he is that is what you can put your trust in you can trust 100 that this guy likes to shame insult and lie so he will do that,MLeek
the quicker you get away from him the quicker you can start to heal,MLeek
this is sexual assault hes dangerous,MLeek
he is going to lose control again because he feels entitled to use your body this way without your consent take your bags leave never come back,MLeek
unless you want to end up having a baby with your rapist because staying in this relationship will almost certainly lead you to being bound to him forever by the baby you have after he rapes you,MLeek
no dude quit it take that venting to the therapist your ex was an abusive monster no one is debating that or ignoring the impact it had on you and your family but that actually isnt the issue today,MLeek
the issue today is your current partner isnt behaving up to snuff in a home with your children fulltime and isnt prepared to do any of the work to improve the situation and your brillant plan appears to be treating her like a convenient income for the next four years or so and then see how you two feel about each other,MLeek
shell probably hate you by then if someone treated you like nothing but a financial crutch tell me you wouldnt,MLeek
get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship im not saying you have to leave but you and your partner both need to realize that is reality and a possibility that is the only way to untrap yourselves it to be willing to seriously contemplate life apart  and then either choose to do the work to stay together or not,MLeek
dude just no,MLeek
this isnt ethicalnonmonogamy or openness this is just drama and you didnt even want opennesses to begin with,MLeek
at best shes confused and not emotionally available for a serious relationship at worst she lacks selfawareness and basic consideration to the point that makes her manipulative or even malicious,MLeek
just no,MLeek
your amazing partner didnt want you to fulltime parent your own kids and now you cant leave a relationship youre all miserable in because you feel perhaps correctly that you cannot afford to,MLeek
pretty obvious why no one feels secure or particuarly loved in this situation,MLeek
get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship,MLeek
part of fully acknowledging that what you did was wrong is accepting the consequences,MLeek
the consequences are that you are not welcome you dont always get another chance it doesnt matter if the other person is shitty or if you think you deserve it it doesnt always happen and frankly do you really want it too these people are insane and the brought out the worst possible behaviour in you a sane person would stay the fuck away from them and not try to seek their approval,MLeek
your bf needs to figure out how he balances his time it feels complicated but its actually not any more practically complicated than that accept have some grace ask for the time you need and respect that he still values some time with these friends,MLeek
hopefully he can recognize that the toxicity at this point is coming from only onedirection  not you who has apologized and will now accept the situation with grace  but his socalled friends who are apparently totally cool with assault and insults and regularly drink to excess this all rather gross for a bunch of 30yearolds,MLeek
any woman who doesnt chase you after shes slept with you is a woman who belongs to the streets,MLeek
tell me youre a shitty lay without telling me youre a shitty lay,MLeek
i agree there isnt we dont know,MLeek
and i wouldnt risk it not this one not if my instincts were what ops appears to be,MLeek
you really seem genuinely confused by this but,MLeek
its okay to demand more from a partner than just them not being abusive,MLeek
you dont have to stay with someone just because they dont hit you or call you names,MLeek
he doesnt seem violent himself,MLeek
the bar is beneath the damn floor,MLeek
someones not treating you right if you are concerned they empathize more with the consequences your abuser faced then the experience of being abused thats not just ignorance and it wouldnt be okay even if it was,MLeek
i would simply walk,MLeek
i would trust my instincts if i suspected my new partner felt more for the man who was inconvenienced by the legal ramifications of his abusive actions then he does for his gf the person he actually knows and supposedly cares for who was abused that is a dealbreaker i wouldnt confront i wouldnt explain i would just say no thank you and walk,MLeek
the first joke was careless and could be overlooked as a oneoff poor judgment call but the concern that he thinks believes your abuser was hard done by or just caught a case should not be overlooked i wouldnt confront or even delve into that id just trust my gut and escape that,MLeek
its one thing to not know what to say or make a dumb joke its another entirely to express more empathy for the person who hurt you facing consequences for that behavior than for you having to live with the ramifications of the abuse,MLeek
you shouldnt stay in a relationship where that doubt and fear has even entered your head i wouldnt he might not mean anything by it but i wouldnt roll those dice on someone id only been dating for a few weeks or months,MLeek
edit dumb typo gut not guy,MLeek
its not on her if you cannot treat her with respect,MLeek
youre not actually taking full ownership of the issue here youre not asking for sensitivity youre asking for submission to your bad behaviours and for her to manage your feelings for you youre asking her either meaningful change or hide how she interacts with her classmates because you cannot handle yourself,MLeek
you need to seriously consider if you are capable of being a partner to anyone at the moment  without being emotionally abusive or controlling towards them because by your own description youre crossing that line,MLeek
yeah that typo doesnt help any but it seems like most people got it all the same,MLeek
approach this from a shared goals point of view,MLeek
you both have a shared goal of living together there is a proposal where you could do that more quickly if he was willing to provide you with a better interest rate than the irs and cc companies would,MLeek
show him your plan for repaying them and how youve worked that plan over the last few months then show him how much quicker it would go if you were repaying him at a less aggressive interest rate,MLeek
from there id suggest you hit pause let him go away and think about it dont get too into the weeds right about how much interest youd pay him or about trading rent for repayments instead just give him the information about how quickly youd be out of debt and roughly how much more quickly you could live together,MLeek
tell him you know its a bit strange and you dont want to pressure him into something hes not comfortable with you want to build your life with him regardless so if hes not comfortable with this youll just keep on working the current plan youve shown him on the current timeline,MLeek
stop going back to this well its run dry,MLeek
you were rarely if ever friends,MLeek
you can know this because the friendship faltered or fell apart when either of you were in established relationships or actively dating others you were almost always the pseudopartner the whatif in the other persons life you were oneanothers fantasy but never oneanothers reality those are the hardest things to let go of the things that never really existed except as a hope the honeymoon stage never ends if it never even begins,MLeek
its time to let that hope die be grateful for the good feels find them in a healthy way with someone else,MLeek
most people in their 30s arent dating partners 10 years younger than them cause they want relationships based on mutual respect and clear boundaries,MLeek
personally i think this is a silly and immature way for an adult man to engage with social media but not a betrayal however that really doesnt matter,MLeek
what matters is whether or not this is a dealbreaker for you hes been clear hes going to continue you are entitled to your feelings but your feelings dont make the rules he gets to agree or disagree and he disagrees you have to decide if that is the kind of relationship you want to stay in or not,MLeek
okay  first off you havent won squat yet,MLeek
some couples try to maintain perfect financial equity but at some point that system tends to break down a real lifetime of teamwork is rarely going to break down 5050 on all fronts,MLeek
if you have a shared goal of homeownership and that could be accelerated or improved by using part of your winnings its a bit silly imo not to be open to other ways to protect your equity besides a perfect 5050 split of the downpayment its not that it would be unfair to her in any way just that it would be kind of silly and bizarre not to factor this change in your financial reality into a holistic plan for your lives together  especially if kids are in the cards,MLeek
buying a home or getting married involves some level of financial risk to both parties you can manage that risk but you cannot erase it not if you want a partnership,MLeek
if either of you wins or inherits a large sum of money it makes sense that the shared plan and goals be reevaluated and that plan should include some protection for individual assets i dont think either of you is showing much sense or nuance on this at all,MLeek
break up with her and give her a deadline for leaving your home a week or two at most,MLeek
you could look for legal advice to support you in this but frankly she is undocumented you could hand her some contact numbers for charitiesngo in your area that supports people in her position but shes unlikely to try to push for tenants rights or 90 days notice,MLeek
dont talk about the things tell her plainly the relationship is over it doesnt matter what she does now doesnt matter if she gets a job tomorrow the relationship is still over,MLeek
if you can offer her cash towards a plane ticket but dont give her anything until she takes her things and leaves and never give her anything more than what you agreed too at that moment then change the locks pay if necessary to have them changed its worth it,MLeek
in the meantime depending on how concerned you are with her behavior between the time you tell her to leave and the day she actually does ask friends if you can store anything of value money or sentimental with them and make sure to keep your technology money any passwords out of her reach,MLeek
the issue is youre feeling a lack of intimacy in your relationship currently,MLeek
the issue is not that she had a past enjoyable sexual experience with someone else,MLeek
you probably have things to talk about it this isnt it,MLeek
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them,MLeek
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,MLeek
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so,MLeek
this was known bullshit in 1796 and its bullshit now its an excuse men use to justify themselves in preying on women they are assuming are either stupid manipulative or weakwilled there nothing about it that is a good idea sane men shouldnt want partners who test them that way to begin with and there is nearly no evidence of women engaging in that behavior  just a lot of rejected men saying they must this theory is just straight misogyny because rejection sucks and lots of men will do anything to negate it,MLeek
you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with for any reason,MLeek
and yes tolerance for casual racism is a rather good reason,MLeek
most people when they find themselves in a crowd of people yelling slurs or say wearing swastikas or hanging nooses at very least leave mike didnt even want to distance himself from eric mike doesnt think the problem is with eric,MLeek
please stop asking reddit you might be finding more validation by creating these variations in the story but the end result is the same,MLeek
break up with her if you do not want to be with her,MLeek
or or seek therapy to manage your emotions in more rational ways,MLeek
her behaviour basically makes sense to me she avoided a past hookup in public who from your previous versions was unkind to her and talked shit about her with his friends and she gave you details about the encounter with him when you kept on probing for more information because you didnt accept her initial brief explanation in your earlier versions you were not the least bit concerned about her safety or only suspicious about the details so now you have more details and you dont like them either,MLeek
your choices and behaviours here make so little sense that i sincerely hope this is fiction,MLeek
id be okay with a return date of 34 months perhaps but 612 months with me using all my vacation to fly to them nah i couldnt sustain a healthy relationship on those terms certainly not one that was only 8 months old,MLeek
i dont think you need to be really clingy to not be okay with this,MLeek
im fiercely independent and have gone a month or two without seeing my partner when worktravel have required it but would i commit to 612 months of an ldr with only maybe a few visits with a man id been dating of ra less than year probably not thats a bad use of my time and energy for a situation that doesnt suit me nothing needy or clingy about that,MLeek
just ignore it but keep your eyes open for ways to move out of his department,MLeek
this man tried to use his position to coerce you into an affair and now hes trying to create plausible deniability,MLeek
continue to document everything,MLeek
he wasnt your friend and you cannot become his,MLeek
he only saw you as a potential affair partner,MLeek
he acted out and retaliated against you when you didnt play along with his fantasy,MLeek
hr may not want to admit what happened but everyone with two brain cells to rub together understands what happened,MLeek
the only thing more you can do to minimize the harm this man can do to you is look for a positive move out of his department before he manufactors a negative one,MLeek
im sensing there might be some downsides to spending a few millennia telling men that god made females for them,MLeek
yeah this is the bullshit that works in the movie dont do that,MLeek
you should bring your own timeline to the meeting though and let her know that you two do choose to reconcile you would plan on purposing in x to x number of months months not years,MLeek
ultimatums get shit on because they dont feel very good to receive but when they are honest they are important she was 100 honest about what she needed in this relationship and she walked when you couldnt meet that that wasnt controlling that is clear honest communication,MLeek
she cannot put a timeline on your healing but she is 100 entitled to place a timeline on her own needs in order for the relationship to move forward,MLeek
just be transparent about what changed your mind dont actually make it all about how wonderful she is focus on what you have recognized about yourself and need to change to in order to build the life you want with her be clear that while you want her the person youre changing for is you because that how change lasts,MLeek
you may not be able to eat your cake and have it too,MLeek
all you can do is be just as transparent and clear as you are here and then youll likely need to step back and give her some time to process this information her initial reaction is likely to be anxious and angry and to feel abandoned youre going to have to let her move through those feelings and figure out what she needs to express to you because those feelings are gonna be valid,MLeek
youre only eight months in and youre suggesting going into and ldr basically for at least that long again its a huge ask of a young relationship,MLeek
most people would break up it would be totally reasonable for her to decide not to remain in a committed relationship with someone making the choice you want to make it may just not work for her,MLeek
your gf doesnt believe her friend will cheat she cares for her friend and the friend is wasted you may be right but youre probably not going to convince your gf to think badly of someone she clearly cares for,MLeek
and youre really having the wrong fight here,MLeek
instead of getting worked up about a bunch of women trying to keep their dumbass drunk friend safe just tell your gf plainly that you wouldnt find her friends behaviour acceptable in your own relationship you wouldnt do it and youd like your gf not to do that either thats the agreement you actually need between the two of you about the boundaries when dancingout at the club,MLeek
in your shoes id be far more concerned about your gfs comfort around drinking to excess and her willingness to take on caretaking roles for her friends in dangerous moments having a frank conversation about what i find acceptable is an easy problem to address trying to talk to your gf about the fact her friend has a substance andor impulse control issue is way harder if one of my friends behaved this way more than once i would decline to go out with her until she got her shit together not because of the risk of cheating but because its not any fun to cockblocking for a drunken moron on the regular,MLeek
i would be more inclined to agree if i thought for a second he was actually concerned with the cost of and access to healthy food and not with just punishing those he deems unworthy,MLeek
this would seem to me to point to large issues in how you deal with finances,MLeek
some couples can nickelanddime like this but personally i think its toxic and counterproductive once you live together,MLeek
if the book is important to you then it doesnt matter what he thinks get the book then end contact if you want to end contact his ego is not relevant to this at all you cannot control what he thinks or feels so why waste any of your time on it,MLeek
but shit if you take your book collections that seriously have a loaner copy i never loan out my copy of my favourite book i have a second copy for the purpose of loaning out its dorian gray you could have grabbed a copy for him for less than 5 dont give people the copies you are attached too in the future,MLeek
is this some sort of first edition a rare find of a book with a dedication inside from your dead relatives or something,MLeek
cause unless this book is irreplaceable youre the one playing games,MLeek
dont pretend to be friends just dont be friends if you think hes keeping you around for a ego trip,MLeek
you drew a boundary about a kind of joking you didnt find funny and didnt feel was healthy for either of you thats not throwing the past in her face thats asking her to not to continue to make jokes that you do not enjoy,MLeek
its reasonable to acknowledge her feelings  she was hurt by your comments and thats not insane to feel hurt  but the message wasnt and shouldnt be intended as an attack its just not funny for you you want to move past it not joke about it,MLeek
all of this i feel for the guy shit as he may be that would be an awful experience and im glad he made it home safely,MLeek
however if any woman had stopped to help a nakedass man in the woods and been attacked  or worse  by said men all the same people bemoaning this guys plight would be blaming her for not using her common sense to avoid the obvious danger of the crazy naked man,MLeek
men know other men are dangerous they act on that knowledge ever fucking day they just dont like it when that reality is reflected in womans choices in ways that inconvenience them personally,MLeek
do you that think men and queer folks up and down the binary dont ghost,MLeek
then dont be friends with her,MLeek
mutations are normal variations within a species individuals dont really undergo speciation groups do its a longterm process not a mutation in a single individual,MLeek
you are free to call yourself a nonhuman and free to not choose to be friends with people who do not honour that thats all ya got,MLeek
no the only problem isnt her communication and the other problems might not be worth solving better to call it off entirely,MLeek
but op can and still get past this bullshit i cant actually say what i want he should just know when i say i feel in a good relationship that will often happen but even if the best relationships actual conversations about actual disagreements are required at times,MLeek
and in a really shit relationship doing so will help you waste less time,MLeek
hey im all for op breaking up with him,MLeek
but if youre not able to express what you would like your partner to do and have a conversation about that then youre setting yourself up to be immature and gameplaying and disappointed thats childrens games adults express reasonable boundaries and expectations and walk away if they are not met being willing to walk away when someone isnt going to offer the kind of relationship you want to be in is the opposite of controlling what is controlling is not telling them and trying to manipulate them into giving you what you want getting more and more worked up angry and resentful when they do the thing you dont dare to actually ask them to do,MLeek
someone can give a fuck about your feelings and still disagree and make a choice for themselves it happens constantly if you cannot manage disagreement as a couple with clear communication then you shouldnt be a couple,MLeek
you have to be able to actually tell your partner what kind of relationship you want to be in and are willing to be in with them,MLeek
thats not controlling thats having needs wishes and boundaries like a full human being who knows themselves well enough and is mature enough to express what she wants and needs,MLeek
what youre doing instead right now ends up being gameplaying and manipulative you get into bullshit arguments about my feelings are valid which of course they are but thats beside the point here and not the problem what you really need to discuss is okay you and i disagree about what is appropriate here with this new female friend lets talk about boundaries we can both live with and help me feel secure and respected in this relationship,MLeek
if you think hes shady dont date him,MLeek
but either way learn to speak up for yourself its not controlling to tell your partner what you want in a relationship and to try to find an agreement with them that suits both of your needs that is literally what healthy conflict resolution looks like,MLeek
he disagrees,MLeek
he understands that you are uncomfortable he disagrees that he needs to do anything differently because youre having that feeling and you dont seem to have actually asked him to do anything differently,MLeek
being understood is not the same as getting what you want,MLeek
expressing your feelings is not the same as actually asking for someone to change their choice or do something differently next time,MLeek
to communicate in healthy respectful ways you have to actually have to ask for what you wantneed not just repeat your feelings at people,MLeek
if you need a boundary you have to ask for it clearly and he might disagree then you have to actually talk about it explicitly and try find an agreement,MLeek
if you didnt ask for a clear boundary then it wasnt totally insane for him to think that you were just expressing your feelings about the situation and that he did not need to change his actions he disagrees that his actions were a problem and you didnt ask him to change them so he didnt,MLeek
you two have to come to an agreement agreements are what change behaviors not just telling him your feelings and hoping hell figure out what you want and do that instead,MLeek
he made a new friend i can understand why that concerned you a little bit but do you really want to be in a relationship where you see every single new femalehuman in his life as a potential threat i prefer a relationship where i trust my partner to make new friends and observe good boundaries with them,MLeek
there is nothing you can do to control another person you have to be kind and clear and trust that your professor is reasonable,MLeek
thank them for their offer acknowledge youve accepted another and express regret at not working on their team at this time do it asap the quicker you tell them the kinder it is to them,MLeek
if she burns the bridge nothing you can do about that youll have done your best,MLeek
again like i said that is possible but if that is the case then good bullet dodged you dont want to be picked by someone who is using that as their picking criteria if that was how he made his decision then you two were not compatible,MLeek
however more likely he is just telling you hes entering or moving towards an exclusive relationship with someone else so he is ending contact with you and no longer available to date casually,MLeek
sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else,MLeek
you really need to accept that its the truth the rest of this is your internal bullshit and baggage and you need to get a grip on this,MLeek
i said about sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else you just would have been hurting more when he did,MLeek
i also dont sleep with people on the first date as a matter of principle i want to take the time to reflect on my experience with them and think about the vibe check before i climb into bed if someone rejects me for this reason that is fine because im confident with my choice nevertheless,MLeek
why are you fixating on sex this was not about sex thats your anxiety and insecurities but it has little to do with this you had one good date that fizzled out thats all thats very very normal,MLeek
seriously this isnt a healthy perspective on dating at all go talk to a therapist and work on owning your own power to choose people and express your interest stop talking to your mother if her advice is straight out of 1940,MLeek
you did nothing wrong he was actively he met someone else he may have liked you very much he liked someone else more,MLeek
sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation only make it hurt more,MLeek
its also possible he felt he was purchasing sex with his dinner in which case you dodged a bullet,MLeek
either way this was a nice date and appropraite ending to a connection you didnt have sex you didnt want to have nothing is wrong here thems the breaks,MLeek
this relationship is over,MLeek
the quicker you get yourself the support you need and get an enforceable legal agreement in place the better off your kids will be,MLeek
all the studies suggest that separation when your children are under 4 is way less damaging than doing it later get this work done now use couples counselling to negotiate the end speak to a lawyer get an individual therapist involved for yourself and the support you need,MLeek
apparently there is no other way for women to support one another and build a vibrant community and family except to surrender to this mans and his gods version of servitude to men,MLeek
what this really tells you sadly is this man has no idea how to maintain healthy relationships or lead a fulfilling life as part of a community except to coerce a woman into doing that work for him,MLeek
make a pillow wall or get a bigger bed,MLeek
but also he has to wake you up,MLeek
he just has to nothing else is going to work except to make you uncomfortable whining about you being not nice while youre unconscious is not an excuse you can and should make some suggestions to address this but he has also gotta be willing to advocate for his own sleep if he stopped moving pushed back or woke you up when you disturbed him your habits while unconscious would be far more likely to adjust if he always accommodates these behaviours while youre asleep youll keep doing them while youre asleep because the asleep version of you doesnt have a problem he has to give the sleeping version some consequences for bad behaviour,MLeek
end all contact with her and get therapy immediately,MLeek
youre hitting yourself that is either a serious mental illness or an attempt to manipulate her,MLeek
this isnt about all women this is about you your inability to make healthy choices for yourself right now  including the choice to stop dating her so stop dating her and please get help for the selfharming behaviours they are not her fault they are something you need to address for yourself,MLeek
there is nothing to do except say to your gf i think hes flirting with you do you think hes flirting with you youre entitled to share your opinion and to listen respectfully to hers that is the end of your power,MLeek
and then let her deal with it trust her judgement or dont date her its her classmate they are her boundaries to enforce when she deems it necessary and in the way she feels is appropriate and right for her,MLeek
dont expect your young gf to go around put other men on blast just because youre having a bad feels get a grip manage your own shit and expect your gf to do what she deems necessary and appropriate,MLeek
do you think youre friends if so id recommend you stop considering this a job and instead call it a favour or hobby for which you might be compensated,MLeek
decide in your own head how much youre willing to do without being paid be at peace with that and then once you hit that either say no or ask for payment,MLeek
either that or tell him youre not available for this work any longer as you need to focus on other lines of income but value his friendship its totally fine to turn down work because the terms just dont feel right to you,MLeek
yeah she knows and if she stopped when she was caught then youve called out the behaviour as much as productively possible,MLeek
dont get hung up on battles you cannot win if youre gonna stay in this relationship save your strength the fights that matter if she stopped this one is as resolved as its every going to be,MLeek
exactly an apology in this case is just a pointless attempt at a power play an apology that everyone involves knows is a lie changes nothing its just score keeping if op is gonna stay in this relationship shes gonna need to learn to pick her battles asap,MLeek
what is the line you think can be drawn here,MLeek
you have to force your mother to pretend to apologize for harassing me or you have to be willing to end all contact and probably your childrens contact with your mother if she wont apologize to me,MLeek
the first one is pointless theatre and the second one is a pretty excessive demand for bf and his children to go no contact with his mother even though bf has never actually chosen to introduce op to his mother  if that is what op really needs  for this woman to not be in her life at all  she is probably headed for a breakup because while that is a totally valid need its not likely to be one her partner is going to immediately agree to this toxic unhinged woman is present in his life and hes can demand she treat op with respect when he includes op but he cannot perfectly control his mother if shes inclined to this degree of nonsense,MLeek
absolutely do not reach out to her yourself ever this is not your battle to fight this is 100 between him and his mother,MLeek
however he doesnt control her he can create boundaries he can say if you dont apologize i wont talk to you anymore but frankly that is a waste of a boundary the boundary hes actually going to need is if you cannot be respectful of my new gf when i am ready to introduce you to her then you will see less of me and of the grandchildren until youre willing to behave with respect towards important people in our lives,MLeek
of course she should apologize but shes not gonna and she wouldnt mean it anyways you cant fix other people you dont get to communicate through idiocy and insanity there is nothing to be worked through here youre not gonna move past this this doesnt get resolved with an apology youre gonna live with a toxic and sorta crazy person in your life unless he chooses to cut all contact with her,MLeek
hes fundamentally correct he cannot and should not be having this fight until he needs to have this fight you either need to trust him to step up when it becomes necessary or you need to leave this relationship,MLeek
you know this is a you problem and that you need to work on it if you want happy and healthy relationships in your life with her or anyone,MLeek
if that isnt enough for you how can anything we say fix this,MLeek
speak to a therapist if youre unable to address these feelings and intrusive thoughts yourself,MLeek
go low contact,MLeek
there is nothing to gain from these relationships you only show up for them out of obligation learn to manage those feelings of duty in healthier ways,MLeek
dont fight who they are just minimize the damage they are able to do to you as an adult,MLeek
nah you were right to cut him off,MLeek
he was either inconsiderate or not that into you or both invest your time elsewhere,MLeek
the issue is you dont like her boundaries you keep pushing against them which is why she is further clarifying what behaviour she is willing to accept from you at this time either you do x or im walking away is a boundary a firm one what you are saying here is that she really should walk away from you which means you are also just as responsible for walking away from her at this point,MLeek
stop having a conversation this doesnt require a compromise your accusations are totally out of whack with reality she doesnt have a problem you do if you think shes doing these nasty things to you then there is truly nothing else to talk about you solve your problem by ending the connection that doesnt suit your needs,MLeek
that doesnt seem fair im not selling an ebook or a program or any crypto at all,MLeek
while she might not be perfect youre being really really immature and resentful about this you need to end this its not on her you have to end it because you are not okay with it,MLeek
it makes perfect sense that she may be looking forward to meeting you and possibly seeing if there is something there in a few months when youre in the uk but unwilling to commit to you at this point,MLeek
at this point she is offering you friendship it is valid if she decides that friendship doesnt include details about her dating life some friendships dont she has told you that you are not exclusive and that she is single which is what she needs to be clear about if she not telling you about other dates she may be on that is because she has judged probably correctly that you are overinvested in this connection and will not handle that information well,MLeek
this is all on you man you dont have to like her choices but her choices sound reasonable and yours dont youre judging her extremely harshly for not being willing to commit to an ldr with a person shes never met for many months thats not hostagetaking or manipulative thats sanity you havent been friendzoned you have been person i met online only and will not meet in person for many months zoned because that is what you are right now she sounds pretty clear about what she is offering you right now which is not exclusivity because of course she isnt you live an ocean away and have for months and will for several months more,MLeek
you majorly overinvested in an ldr and youre blaming her for not taking responsibility for your feelings and making it her job to end this connection to protect you from your own poor choices,MLeek
thats not fair its your job to end this if it doesnt work for you,MLeek
her boundaries with you right now make a lot sense  you are not committed to one another youve never even met in person compatibility is still a big question mark no matter how much you enjoy speaking to one another she knows youre overinvesting so shes keeping you on an information diet about her personal life she is telling you to either get a grip and respect her boundaries or opt out,MLeek
your expectations for a level of commitment from a woman you havent even met are extremely unrealistic if this connection is unhealthy for you or making you unhappy you need to leave it its not all her fault that you wont do the right thing for you,MLeek
it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself,MLeek
it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself  living environment to another slightly less toxic and unsafe living environment but youre still not where you need to be,MLeek
your reaction to this was pretty intense for someone who says shes okay with porn and understands this isnt cheating,MLeek
the obvious problem here is that either he lied or he is so unaware of his own actions and motivations that he couldnt provide an answer for why he screenshots these,MLeek
i have no issues with porn but i find it immature and boundarybusting when people repurpose social media images as if they are porn those women arent producing those images for that reason or consenting plenty of women out there are there is no reason for it unless you enjoy the violation of women who are not consenting to be porn starts plus its just childish in my opinion,MLeek
what he did was probably within normal but lots of normal things are shitty and id be concerned by his lack of honesty andor selfawareness about this habit,MLeek
dude you came for advice youve been given it,MLeek
im not getting into what is the correct amount to charge them because you have completely missed the window to discuss payment you claim to full accept that fact but youre still trying to wiggle outta it the fact that february was within the initial agreement is why that was the appropriate window,MLeek
were not brokers for room rentals in your area were talking about the relationship you can ask for whatever amount you feel youre entitled to but youre likely to damage the relationship thats the advice its not about the dollar value you want to assign,MLeek
still gonna go with no but also who the fuck cares if it does seriously how is this beneficial to you to give your mental energy too youve already done the only thing you can do short of ending the friendship entirely learn to let go,MLeek
finding the baby voice unpleasant is a totally different opinion to express than asking her to silence or stop her affectionate text messages,MLeek
one is about style the other is about substance,MLeek
by all means give her notes on the style honestly the baby voice thing has just never been cute for me ive always found it a bit offputting but i wouldnt suggest you in the early days tell her that she should hold back on expressing her desire to be with you you dont seem to be describing bombarding here youre describing one text where she tells you she cares for you and misses you,MLeek
are you really that special that much a unique niche of an employment path really,MLeek
because i have a super niche path and career and i can still think of three people a few years younger than me who have made very very similar steps it never occurred to me to consider they were copying me we have similar goals and skill sets they are my professional colleagues not my mimics,MLeek
you are already doing the only thing you can do if this annoys you keeping the information you give him to a minimum besides that id advise you to get over yourself there is nothing to deal with except to decide if youre willing to put a positive word in when asked or not,MLeek
youre going to damage this relationship if you try to ask for payment for a gift youve already given to someone you say you basically consider a family member,MLeek
its as simple as that there is no magical way to demand payment now that wouldnt be hurtful they probably would accommodate you but it probably would damage the relationship because you handled the communication so poorly,MLeek
the time to revisit the could chuck us some money conversation from a place of respect was like february you missed your window by a mile,MLeek
i offered to pay for storage unit but the argument was why buy stuff if youre just going to store it but i like having rare sets to rebuild on occasion,MLeek
right so this is a thing to revisit as you take a deeper dive in your shared financial life,MLeek
but while doing so you need to recognize that while collecting or hoarding may serve a positive emotional need for you it may just as legitimately cause anxiety and distress in her to see more things piling up those are very real feelings you both have to be willing to acknowledge and address,MLeek
stop seeing this as a money problem and start seeing this as a feelings problem,MLeek
your gf doesnt feel secure with your shared saving plansgoals,MLeek
that is a problem worthy of addressing her feelings and opinions on that are fundamentally valid and worthy of your attention and time if you want to marry her you either need to increase those goalsplans or by help her gain more understanding of them so she can feel confident in the shared choices there are some financial advisors who specialize in helping couples have these conversations and building the emotional aspects of financial literacy,MLeek
the money isnt the core problem here the problem is that the money brings forward very different feelings in you both in order to build a life where she feels secure and you feel trusted and happy you need to come together to acknowledge and manage those feelings,MLeek
secondly and i could be wrong here but perhaps recognize that both of your nerdy hobbies dont just take up money they take up space collecting isnt just about money its about space and lifestyle she may genuinely dislike these hobbies but you still need to be reasonable enough to realize that a lego collection impacts her in ways sports tickets do not my ex was always on me about how i didnt respect his miniatures but i had no problem with him being nerdy and liking minis what i didnt like was the fact that he hoarded so many nerdy objects that my home was frequently uncomfortable and uninviting and he never parted with any of them accumulation without consideration was the issue not the money,MLeek
i dont care much for any of the people involved here and there is a lot of blame to go around but they were all responding to understandable stupid harmful pressures,MLeek
it does hit hard against that dichotomy want a happy life long marriage pick the adult woman you respect as an equal who really understands your goals and your values,MLeek
who is keeping the list,MLeek
today we are,MLeek
battery half of,MLeek
water,MLeek
the plot of the lion king or maybe just the villain arch the minions its a bit unclear,MLeek
please reread my post i suggest several avenues to bring these issues forward,MLeek
your bad feels are not the biggest issue here that the university can help you address  the issue here is he is not doing his job and he is not being respectful when he communicates with or about students,MLeek
you need to frame your issues in a way that makes it easier for the school to understand and address,MLeek
i would jus speak to your student ombudsperson directly to get clarity on what is expected of this helper and what your actual obligations to him are,MLeek
in the meantime block this mans number,MLeek
fundamentally there could be reasonable causes for an adult instructor to call an adult student in university the boundaries arent the same as they are in high school however without further instructions i think youre well within your own rights to withdraw consent from this particular person reaching out to your personal cell phone,MLeek
edit the fact you met with him for an extended period and none of your classes got book ie the outcome of the meeting wasnt achieved is actually probably your stronger objective complaint against him remember youre not just a student deserving of respect youre also a customer and this guy is giving you shitty service start with your ombudsperson or get advice from your student union even your program director is a another possible avenue but id get my ducks in a row before speaking with then,MLeek
i totally believed this happened you can pop cyst like this during sex or riding a bike or getting outta bed too fast but it was not for the reasons he thinks,MLeek
it is so fucking rare for husbands to show up at all when their wife is in hospital that any one who does a smidge more than drop off clean undies a magazine is treated like a god damn prince some nurses are as guilty of this shit as anyone,MLeek
so it wasnt about your dick ya dumbass you were getting wildly praised and rewarded for the baseline of care that woman are expected to provide without comment or complaint,MLeek
and if you can at all help if do not be sold off into a politically advantageous marriage while still a teenager to a man a decade older who is definitely not over his ex,MLeek
if these mens version of  a traditional woman requires that woman be in poverty and disempowered socially maybe there is something exploitative about wanting that kind of tradition,MLeek
how can you make it a nonissue that your husband is spiteful and doesnt listen to you or have any respect for your anxiety about money,MLeek
you cant not alone you feel rejected because you are being rejected and ignored not just misunderstood,MLeek
communication takes two people you cannot fix it entirely on your own the question you need to ask yourself right now is if you have a partner or not in solving this problem,MLeek
thats because shes bitter and hit the wall so they dont have to listen to her anymore s,MLeek
their system is flawless anyone who disagrees with them is always oldfatugly anyways,MLeek
dont try to jump the queue to become girlfriend by being friend with benefit that almost never works and it shouldnt you cannot be next in line for a relationship with someone,MLeek
if he wanted to date you he would he doesnt,MLeek
what youre considering would be harmful for you you dont want to be his fwb so dont agree to it only pretending to be an fwb while trying to wiggle your way into something more is dishonest and unkind either say no or admit to him what you really want,MLeek
youre arguing that you see the exact same percentage of women imagining the man in the service role is seriously flirting with them sure we cannot read minds we can read context like the context of someone being paid to be a pleasant sales associate or server,MLeek
because i spend a lot of time with women and while i have definitely heard a sales guy or bartender referred to as sucha flirt not a single woman i have met was confused about his role as a service provider,MLeek
there are plenty of errors that are just human but this one when it comes to flirting vs service is just not a 5050 cognitive error,MLeek
he told me that even watching porn when you have a boyfriend should be considered cheating so naturally i would assume that the same should apply to him,MLeek
if none of the other reasons cut it for you this one obviously should he shamed you and verbally abused you for far far less than he deliberately did behind your back and then he lied about it in the lamest possible way he thinks youre a moron,MLeek
whether or not you or i or he thinks this is cheating doesnt even matter it doesnt have to be cheating to be totally unacceptable dont get pulled into that argument with anyone this is all a very dangerous double standard from a man who is giving every signal he is willing to abuse you,MLeek
you dont owe him a conversation this isnt a debate this is him getting dumped for being dishonest and a dangerous partner keep yourself safe end it quickly and cleanly get rid of this man,MLeek
you are not completely innocent here because you violated the agreement when ella said she had caught feelings your responsibility was to say i understand but since that has happened i am no longer comfortable continuing with the sexual relationship,MLeek
youre not a monster but dont get attached is a hope its an intention its not a thing that can be promised it is not a boundary the boundary is if one of us catches feels we stop fucking,MLeek
so you had the exact same responsibility as ella had to end it when that happened  i would actually say you had the greater responsibility at that point since she had just told you that her motivations and judgements were clouded by her emotions and her attachment to you continuing to have sex with her at that point was selfish and naive your actions were not reflecting the agreement you said you wanted when you continued to meet up and have sex with ella after that conversation,MLeek
youre not a villain but you did fuck it up you had a clear line with ella at which all sexual connection should have ended and you both blew right past that line maybe not everything ella thinks of you now is reasonable but it was not kind you should have done better,MLeek
you need to just walk away,MLeek
he may be a lovely partner in some ways but he is absolutely not capable of offering you a relationship you should feel at all secure in and hes been dishonest from the beginning trying to manipulate you into accepting something he knew was a rather lousy offer,MLeek
this isnt a situation where everything is great except this this is him this is a guy who dove into dating while still fullon living with his ex gave totally false timelines introduced his kids way too early and has not been prioritizing his separation or creating a healthy home life for his kids,MLeek
this may be a good guy making shit choices but more likely its a rather shitty guy making rather shitty choices,MLeek
breaks are bullshit they are slowmotion breakups that just prolong the drama its time to be broken up tell him hes welcome to call you if he gets his act together and starts to actually live separately from his ex and has the time to date and be a coparent but dont hold your breath far more likely hell move on to another young thing he can manipulate into accepting this shitty situation for a few months,MLeek
its a neutral term  if you value your friends as friends what was their argument for misogyny that men didnt actually want her friendship so calling them that was offensive or a mislabel,MLeek
i think there can be a lot toxicity in fwbs situations because people forget to be friendly and end up viewing the other more like an amateur sex worker instead of buddy you share a fun activity with or they define down what would be objectively called casually dating into a fwbs situation but in my experience those issues are also pretty gender neutral men and woman both those mistakes,MLeek
hed never be so beta as to allow something like over a decade of data and welldocumented trends to penetrate his skull not when he saw with his own two eyes how the paid server smiled demurely at him not merely performing  her job in the expected style but clearly begging for the leadership and protection of a man,MLeek
there are cultural norms there are affects,MLeek
there is no more truth in his racist delusions about what those norms actually represent in individual human relationships then there is truth is his understanding of human biology,MLeek
ironically he did figure out anal tho,MLeek
and with a healthy dose of idiots not being able to tell the difference between customer service and women being super into them,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
this guy is telling you stories stories about how he think its permissible to treat others believe him,MLeek
he will turn around one of these days and declare you are just like all the others  and he will decide probably without telling you that he can treat you like the others then he will tell you youre not entitled to be hurt or angry with him because he warned you,MLeek
lots of people score a bit higher in sociopathic tendencies and recognize that means they need to work a little bit harder to empathize or to keep the ego in check people who struggle with this are pretty safe they compensate and focus on what healthy relationships really take people who say well this is just how i am and now you know fair warning are not,MLeek
you dont compromise,MLeek
you trust him so trust him to select his own friends and not hook up with strangers,MLeek
if you think he can be persuaded to cheat then you dont trust him and shouldnt date him  hes a 20 year old adult not an 8 eight year old on the playground being bullied into eating dirt or some shit if he doesnt want to cheat he wont,MLeek
emasculated is one of those toxic traps where the more you help him the more blame youll catch,MLeek
continue to be realistic most entry level jobs are easier to get when youre physically present there is little reason for someone to want to employ an 18 year old who cant start tomorrow thats usually the appeal of teenage employees,MLeek
besides that just listen agree that it does suck and it is disappointing  because it is that what it is not is a reflection on him as a man reminder him this has nothing to do with his gender  and even less to do with yours hes a person not a potential provider,MLeek
she didnt want to talk to a group of people who had said nasty things about her,MLeek
this is not rocket science youre being a weirdo who is making it all about sex when its about not talking to mean people who have insulted or shamed you previously if she has an ex who is a basically decent person or perfectly reasonable to not be nervous about him but to be nervous and want to avoid a group of bullies,MLeek
what went down with her made sense your reaction was intense and really strange you need to figure out what was going on inside your own head that led to this her explanations for what went on in her head pass the sniff test just fine,MLeek
its honestly terrifying where americans even ones who might consider themselves democrats think the centre is,MLeek
i remember back in the day trying to explain to a few american friends that obamas policies were not left of centre in any other established democracy very centrist even sometimes right of centre which was a large part of his global popularity,MLeek
but the far right nutters just saw a black man lost their shit completely and now here we all are,MLeek
shes not your problem its not her job to fix the issues in your relationship shes not your ally and youre not trying to help her out youre desperately trying to manipulate her into helping you out because you and your bf cannot find an agreement that works,MLeek
your problem is that you are choosing to stay in a relationship with someone you believe is cheating on you,MLeek
stop pretending to be worried about her wellbeing get a damn clue and realize youre the poor girl involved in this situation who isnt behaving in healthy ways or with any selfrespect,MLeek
if you cannot resolved this by speaking with him then it cannot be resolved,MLeek
stick to the no,MLeek
this was a rather transparent move on her part to force a meet with the children to justify her curiosity about you,MLeek
you and your bf have not decided to make a relationship with the children part of this relationship yet continue to not include the children in your plans when you do decide you are both ready for that step then you and she may need to meet briefly while custody is exchanged that is sufficient she gets to shake your hand not break bread with you,MLeek
whats best for the children is you declining as much as possible to play her game or become more a character in her little drama,MLeek
hes 22 he is not a boy he doesnt need to be handled hes not a toddler going through a phase where he find poop hilarious,MLeek
it is completely realistic to expect a 22 year old to be honest about their own interest in and opinions on porn use while in a relationship and to keep a promise if they make it,MLeek
men are people not dumb animals who cannot help themselves,MLeek
he doesnt agree with you about porn he never has he thinks its acceptable in a relationship,MLeek
if you want a relationship with someone who doesnt watch porn you need to date someone else,MLeek
if you want to stay with him youre going to have to find a way to deal with this as a legitimate and transparent disagreement instead of a hard boundary,MLeek
this man is too old to not understand that not everyone has a close or meaningful relationships with their parents and adult siblings,MLeek
and five months is quick for this kind of pressure and judgment,MLeek
what is weird is that he is not making the effort to listen to you and i understand who is actually important in your life,MLeek
as sad as it is if she needs to break up over this youd be wise to just accept that and wish her well,MLeek
she withheld information that was clearly relevant to her about her virginity and sexual experience for five years,MLeek
youre not the asshole she needs do the work herself to move past this if she is not willing or able to do that then you need to have the strength to face the end,MLeek
i wouldnt date this man,MLeek
hes telling stories about money mean untrue stories about you because of his choices about his money,MLeek
its one thing to be bad at budgeting but telling mean stories that its someone elses fault that youre spending what youre spending is a serious character flaw and one that will likely impact other areas of his life too itll be your fault he doesnt have enough free time your fault hes gaining weight your fault the house is cluttered with things your fault the grocery bill is too high,MLeek
be very very wary of signing up for a lifetime with someone who externalizes blame like this his gfwife will always be the most conveniently located external person to take the blame for his actions,MLeek
romantic intimacy not requiring a big budget is not your real core problem here,MLeek
this is shady and i wouldnt like it,MLeek
but his answer is plausible and im not surprised he tried to manage you this way,MLeek
this whole exchange was deeply immature on both sides,MLeek
talk to her as everyone is saying try some more actually relaxing games,MLeek
lots of gamers  men and women  think the golden rules change when they are gaming and that angry outbursts and namecalling are part of the culture you need to be able to say clearly that its not i love to game but ive had to have a few tough conversations with friends that if being able to yell or call people nasty names or throw things in anger is an important part of thier gaming experience  then they dont to game with me,MLeek
im an adult who likes to game if you are a gamer because you want to behave like a toddler sometimes please play with the other oversized toddlers,MLeek
it sounds like he feels he has done nothing wrong and broken no agreements with you,MLeek
he deleted the texts for six months,MLeek
he knew damn well he was violating the spirit of his exclusive relationship agreement with op even if he tries to claim he wasnt technically doing anything wrong trust doesnt work on technicalities trust was broken here,MLeek
why do you need to be the bigger person,MLeek
youre not holding on to the past youre addressing an ongoing issue with his choices,MLeek
he continues to bask in the attention of this woman who behaved inappropriately for months and who he only stopped enjoying the attention from when he got caught he knew he violating boundaries with these conversations  you know he knew because he was deleting the messages and telling her they were a problem but not telling her to stop it,MLeek
if a person who has a long history of ignoring my boundaries and flirting with me in direct disrespect of the relationship they know damn well im in climbs onto the treadmill beside mine i wrap up my workout and leave that person is not my friend,MLeek
it is reasonable to assume from this conversation hes at least quite aware of it and has seen some,MLeek
what you need to ask is if he engages with it regularly and thinks its acceptable porn consumption because you dont think its acceptable and you dont want to date someone who ever engages with it,MLeek
good luck with it  and with the therapy,MLeek
i think your boundaries are the right ones but your fears are a bit extreme and they are making this harder for your to deal with than it needs to be youre getting overworked and spun out and drawn to extreme cases you need to reign that in and realize your boundaries are important and valid even if watching this porn doesnt necessarily mean your bf is ever going to even look at an actual human child in that way once in his life its still not okay you dont have to be okay with it,MLeek
if you watch porn that features childrens bodies  even if they are illustrated  i cannot date you i feel too strongly that that is completely wrong to do i expect you to answer honestly is this porn you engage with and think is acceptable,MLeek
first you get into therapy you work on better managing your anxiety the odds of there being immediate risk or danger to anyone on this topic are rather low,MLeek
ethics in porn creation and consumption is important to me as well i would also draw the line with my partners if they were engaging with illustrated porn of prepubescent bodies its not acceptable to me even as fantasy even as an illustration to contextualize a childs body as a sexual object its a hard red line for me i wont date that person,MLeek
but like your cnc kink i would not assume that porn consumption meant pedophilic criminal behaviour was terribly likely just that i dont want to date someone who doesnt hold themselves to a higher standard when it comes to consuming pornography and framing their own sexual identity through what they consume,MLeek
youre going to need to revisit this conversation with him but i think you need some tactics to deal with anxiety before youre going to make it a productive one,MLeek
if hes testing you hes validationseeking and validation seeking is knowing how to communicate to get what you want its just a toxic way to go about it,MLeek
in the end you have to decide what you want in a relationship but if i was feeling i was having arguments multiple times a week after only two months i wouldnt be keen to continue either you need to be able to reframe these conversations and bring the temperature down or youre in for a hell of a lot of needless drama in my opinion,MLeek
if hes seeking attention and validation by picking petty fights with you thats pretty much the worst possible dynamic for someone who has a history of feeling smothered in relationships even if the other fights get resolved easily enough that would be a real concern to me i dont keep people around who use negative behaviours to try to get my attention,MLeek
if youre now in ldr after the move i absolutely wouldnt hold out much hope for it getting better,MLeek
this is two months this is you both on your best behaviour its not great,MLeek
i often joke that no one who lives in toronto drives in toronto we drive only to get out of toronto,MLeek
i owed a car for years and walked 45 mins to work on most days could i have driven it to it 10 mins on most days absolutely would it have been worth it absolutely not,MLeek
hah it really isnt but i do think were under a lot more construction downtown than ottawa is thats a lot of the dust in the downtown i have that experience every time i visit new york and the new yorkers are all like how do you like the big city and i think i know for a fact you can keep cities olders and wetter than this one cleaner than this one but its great,MLeek
youre unlikely to acquire the gf object to service your emotional needs like its a rare drop or legendary weapon or a partyplanner or a substitute mommy,MLeek
the older you get the more women are going to be turned off by this attitude towards them likewise your inability to form friendships with women you dont find sexually appealing always a bit of concern it means you are not able to value a woman as a person unless there is a chance they will be servicing your gf object requirements,MLeek
youve had a relatively normal amount of dating experience for an 18 year old thats not the problem the attitude is,MLeek
you need to fill your life better with or without a gf this dissatisfaction and any childhood drama is your job to address not the gf objects job build a life another person would actually want to share and be interested in and build relationships that arent based solely on getting your needs met but on equal exchange and mutual enjoyment,MLeek
play stupid games win stupid prizes,MLeek
some things are only fun as fantasies its okay to learn that,MLeek
also stop thinking about these potential thirds as if they arent real people with their own agency just because shes in an open relationship doesnt mean she had wanted to fuck the two of you,MLeek
keep the conversation shelved full stop it doesnt need to be more complicated than that just because someone seems convenient doesnt mean you should fuck them,MLeek
you put your foot down,MLeek
and if youre ready for a divorce go ahead with that and get a lawyer involved,MLeek
this is now crossed the line from him feeling whatever hes feeling to him acting in a way that is emotionally abusive,MLeek
the constant accusations of cheating without him willing to do anything to address his negative thoughts or behaviours or bad feelings is unacceptable it is abuse he needs to take some damn responsibility for himself and stop adding this issue entirely to your workload youre already doing plenty if he actually wants his feelings and concerns addressed he has to be part of the work to resolve this and not the abuser,MLeek
you cannot prove a negative you are know youre not cheating you know you dont the time in the day to cheat you cannot fix this for him you can recommend couples counselling but go in very cautiously because there is a real risk here that he wants to abuse you  that that is the point and not the accidental outcome here,MLeek
dont consent to cameras or to the invasion of your privacy until hes 100 committed to doing the work to get past his own bullshit if you do he will very very likely use this access to escalate his abuse not resolve it you seriously need to be considering your safety first and his feelings second,MLeek
the sad reality is very few 40 years old are choosing partners in their early 20s because they want an emotionally healthy relationship built on mutual respect possible but not likely,MLeek
and the stereotype is also sadly true he probably knows you dont have 10 mins in the day to cheat the most likely thing here is that he is projecting and is either cheating himself or wishing he was,MLeek
most relationships dont last forever,MLeek
but you dont stand a chance of noticing a good relationship when youve got one if you dont change these bad habits,MLeek
take a deep breath and see this for what it is this relationship isnt perfect this relationship might not last however if you want to give it the best shot to last or even to end on good terms you need to change your habits and find ways to manage your anxiety that should be the bulk of the work youre doing to maintain this,MLeek
thats nice,MLeek
hes naive dont take on his education,MLeek
consider this a learning experience you need to laugh at what you cannot and should not do anything about youre taking this too onto yourself,MLeek
sure,MLeek
but cities that dont prioritize walkability bike lanes and green spaces dont see those same benefits and then there is the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from dense urban living which increases the risk of stroke heart disease lung cancer and asthma,MLeek
there is a lot of evidence that living in cities  especially welldesigned and governed ones  is a net win for individual human health but there is no reason to pretend there we are not making some trades offs and that really we need to make larger changes so people are able to be healthier regardless of the community they are living in,MLeek
you absolutely can tell her i wouldnt id go and enjoy her company  consider it a gift youre giving her  and id tell her later in a few days that im played out on tea and want to make a different tradition offer one or two other suggestions for a new event or activity you can do together on special days,MLeek
its not untrue its just framing the message in the least hurtful way sending her scrambling the day before is not terribly kind,MLeek
this is the answer dense urban environments dont have many health benefits but this is the one they do generally less time spent commuting and commuteserrands where walking is economical,MLeek
toronto is also exceptionally diverse  even in comparison to other major cities on the planet  so youre looking at a totally cornucopia of different eating habits and cultures around food,MLeek
if you drove out north to the small towns in ontario youd see a difference although broadly speaking canadians are slightly less obese than american counterparts probably a lot of reasons some just around portions sure but also i expect that better access to preventive medical care means we may get the heads up earlier if were at risk,MLeek
that doesnt change your responsbilty to this relationship,MLeek
your responsibility is to end it,MLeek
its not reasonable or kind to sit back and say well he hasnt left me yet so its his own damn fault hes still dating an addict its not all his fault you fully share the blame when you allow a relationship to continue where you know for a fact you are not offering them what they say they need,MLeek
youve already made it clear youre not going to accept this ultimatum,MLeek
which means you must end the relationship nothing else is acceptable,MLeek
yes the relationship should end if you dont want to abandon your lifestyle of using,MLeek
its really not any more complicated than that youre not dedicated to your sobriety he wants a sober partner its time for one of you to end this,MLeek
its not all on him its your job too dont encourage him to leave walk away because you are not offering him what he has told you he needs this is on you stop trying to make it all his job to leave you he should but youre just as responsible for the end as he is,MLeek
extremely skewed this is a relationship your wife has formed its not a mechanic for humans,MLeek
im concerned you continue to gloss over the fact you are eavesdropping that needs to stop completely and forever the only information you are privy to about her therapy is the information she shares with you,MLeek
youre missing mine,MLeek
there is no situation in which is acceptable for you to sit and listen to your wifes therapy like this without both her permission and the therapists,MLeek
you describing hearing way to much and forming far too deep an opinion for it to be accidental and even if you insist this was accident you dont appear to realize it cannot happen again,MLeek
we dont know the therapist sucks right now neither do you we do know you are not holding yourself to an appropriate standard when it comes to your wifes privacy because you have told us you are not,MLeek
this is staggeringly inappropriate and disrespectful why do think this is an okay way for you to behave do you sit beside her at every dental cleaning to hear what the dentist says read all of her emails examine her shit before shes allowed to flush,MLeek
you need to quit this,MLeek
you do not know what is going on with your wife but i dont know what is going on with you but you have some of your own shit to figure out here this is not cool,MLeek
hit the breaks hard and put these assumptions aside,MLeek
and absolutely stop eavesdropping leave the house if you cant help but overhear shit that shouldnt even need to be said,MLeek
you dont know what goes on in that room your envisioning is counterproductive and unhelpful,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely the therapist drastically changed their approach unless your wife askedindicated they do so,MLeek
what is far far more likely is your wife changed what she is listening to and how she is engaging with the therapy,MLeek
instead ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques focus on how that approach was initially helpful to her in the early stages her time was not a waste you saw the things of value she was getting out of it previously,MLeek
finally recognize that a therapist saying yes that is difficult and yes that does suck is perfectly valid and helpful and that your wife was entitled to change how she engaged with therapy,MLeek
you cannot manage your way out of every stressor and difficulty in life sometimes shit just sucks for a while dont assume your wife needs to be further fixed or just has to do better that sounds to me like a bit of toxicity positivity sneaking in what she might actually need from you as well at the moment is just the validation that yes this is hard hard things are hard sometimes there isnt much better to be had or to be done and we just live through the hard bits,MLeek
just decline the future plans if you want to continue to rebuild a relationship with olivia invite her to oneonone things and not double dates,MLeek
i wouldnt inform her unless she asked,MLeek
this is what a responsible civil defence looks like when the accused is definitely guilty of way way worse than the issue at hand,MLeek
they just need the court to put a  on this one so they can go home without admitting to something thatll get him more than a fine,MLeek
yeah dont do it,MLeek
just tell her youre really happy for her but you have confirmed to attend an engagement party now and arent able to make it at that time,MLeek
try to book another time to see her in the near future  maybe make some nice oneonone time planned with her during your mothers day trip,MLeek
you can also tell her that while she may be ready to forgive her bf youre fed up with him treating your sister like dirt and will be minimizing the time you spend near him,MLeek
this is manipulation while it is true that anyone can and should leave a marriage that isnt working when someone is constantly holding a gun to the head of the relationship threatening to shoot if they dont get everything they want then youre not in a partnership anymore youre in a hostage situation,MLeek
dont tolerate the word divorce being thrown around lightly if he says he wants a divorce tell him he is welcome to one  if he wants out you want him to get out  but he is not welcome to constantly threaten you with one just to get his way,MLeek
tell him it doesnt matter if its love or lust its unwelcome,MLeek
this is boundarybusting unwelcome behavior if he wants to respect your marriage and respect you as an individual then you expect him to respect you right now when you ask him to quit this permanently,MLeek
if he doesnt immediately correct himself or if he begs or bargains or tries to say youve just misunderstood then he values his idea being in love but not lust with you over his actual friendship with the human being you actually are in which case get rid of him,MLeek
own your own shit,MLeek
i would appreciate it if youd get a checkup i dont want to keep talking about the maybes i care about you and it would make me feel more secure to know,MLeek
he may still say no but at least youll have been honest about what you are actually feeling and not beating around the bush trying to make him feel the same way you do,MLeek
yeah no,MLeek
im sticking with my reasonable assumption that he is making the purchase and they are paying him back the comment above refers to them still needing to pay him back even if they couldnt go because they are not refundable,MLeek
hes the one with the membership so hes making the purchase to get a better rate hes tasked with buying the tickets they are paying him back for their share,MLeek
this op would be very very clear if he was the one paying for all three of them each time hes not gonna let that be unclear if he was gifting his buddies to a trip to the movies once a month,MLeek
probably and if it was him going about his previous plans is the best way to deny her the control and not let this tactic work,MLeek
i mean i wouldnt want to date someone i suspected of that but short of breaking up that is his only option its not like he can force her to go to work,MLeek
it may be petty to force a verbal agreement i actually like usqitten suggestion here way more than mine do that,MLeek
listen to upurveyorofsocks this is not how socks are to be purveyed,MLeek
i dont want to turn this in to a family vacation to serve my own needs,MLeek
okay but consider how that conversation was from her perspective that is exactly what it seemed you were trying to achieve even though some of the boys werent free anyways that would be a very reasonable pov for her to have here she planned x trip with her and one son and friends and you tried to turn it into y whole family trip you said y was important and how you wanted to spend the money then you didnt answer but im assuming here you did nothing else about actually making y happen but remain quietly upset and asked no further questions about her plans for x,MLeek
look shes not here to give advice too id be telling her to validate your feelings and recognize the important of shared meaningful activities but youre the one here and youre fighting the wrong battle and not working for or planning or advocating for the family vacation you told her you valued,MLeek
take it to the counsellor if you need help getting back on track,MLeek
he should be ashamed for leaving cum socks shoved in the couch cushions,MLeek
if he is feeling shame he is responding like a rational person to be caught out being an inconsiderate slob dont let him pretend hes so stupid that he didnt know this wasnt respectful behaviour in shared spaces,MLeek
you already apologized for making jokes and making light of the situation you can repeat that if youd like however his behaviour does need to change you being insensitive doesnt mean he gets to shove x many more socks into the couch you both know that,MLeek
youve got other issues in your relationship that got pulled into this fight acknowledge that say it out loud you know youre both frustrated about other things as well when it comes to sex but for this very specific subject youd like him to agree there will be no more cum socks shoved in the couch cushions,MLeek
and what did she say about the idea of also planning a family vacation with you and the rest of the kids have you taken any steps yourself or put any of your energy into this or suggested any possible future plans on this,MLeek
if you want to plan something as a couple or a family vacation then you should do that and advocate for that with her but you can value that and your time together as a family without going on the attack with other plans she might also value especially if cost isnt a key issue here,MLeek
trying to turn something which someone else invited her and one son on into a family vacation to serve your emotional needs when some of the other kids arent even free to go anyways was not a great move your feelings are valid but that doesnt mean every single way you may handle them is particularly wise,MLeek
i think you reacted from a really emotional place understandable but not entirely fair and her response was predictable if she had wanted you to come she had the opportunity to frame it that way she wanted it to be okay that youre not included,MLeek
you need to back this way up valuing having a family vacation is just dandy only deciding you value that because you felt left out in this case and dont like this plan is hurtful,MLeek
hes a mooch,MLeek
38yearold men arent this stupid unless its a useful tactic,MLeek
invite him to prioritize himself fully you look for someone who treats you like a partner not a nicer place to crash for free than mommies,MLeek
no kiddo it isnt gay people are plenty capable of being sexist racsit andor homophobic assholes and while no one can stop you people are gonna call you an asshole thats the consequence of being an asshole,MLeek
on the amazingly slim chance youre not just a troll its good your friend knew you well enough not to bother having this pointless argument with your selfabsord ass,MLeek
this might point to a more basic inability to communicate like ive said its not work you can do alone its a job you have to be a fully committed part of but if she cannot do her part as well it doesnt resolve and then youre just both get stuck in a place where youre just not compatible,MLeek
good luck with it,MLeek
right the joke is that you think other gay men lack selfrespect and that they choices they make for themselves are rude selfabsorbed and just stereotypes,MLeek
and you think that is totally funny and not at all judgemental or homophobic,MLeek
like we cannot stop you from thinking that but its boneheaded and wrong and if i hung out with you id be saying yuck that that pile of bullshit,MLeek
so whats the joke exactly,MLeek
is the joke that other gay men are too feminine to hang with the boys that they are too flirty too sexually aggressive too woke too annoying,MLeek
what makes the other gay men one of the bad ones and you not one of those,MLeek
cause i think when you try to explain that you might realize when its not really all that funny id never describe myself as one of the good bisexuals because most bisexuals are fantastic and assholes can be assholes because they are assholes not because they are bi,MLeek
does he where,MLeek
theyre nonrefundable paul and mike said they wouldnt mind paying their share anyway but i bet they wouldnt like it if it actually happened,MLeek
the anyways in there certainly implies they regularly pay him back for the tickets he books for the group,MLeek
youre in the wrong for believing this person is a good partner for you,MLeek
even if he started out with this kind of pigheadedness its been a year and a half and hes developed zero respect or appreciation for what you study and do thats an even bigger issue in my opinion than the compatibility one,MLeek
that doesnt really address more than a few words of what i actually said,MLeek
there were emotions at play here that you steamrolled over and left your gf feeling less connected and valued,MLeek
you dont need to buy her takeaway to be nice but sheesh could you really not figure out how to be any nicer than this,MLeek
you both kinda suck today,MLeek
she should have respected the first no but you sound like youre nickelanddiming her when she feels unwell and im not surprised she felt hurt by that likewise im not sure why she wouldnt have offered to order for you both,MLeek
you do need to be open to joining your partner in small things that bring that joy sometimes maybe this wasnt the time but there do need to be times or even the most budgetconscious of partners may end up feeling pushed away and unloved,MLeek
im not going to pretend i respond as well as i should to criticism but i would rather be told whats up rather than be blissfully ignorant of her pain i dont try to make it so she cant tell me things and i dont understand why she feels that way,MLeek
you see the contradiction there right you know you could do better but dont want to understand why she might feel like you should do better,MLeek
im not trying to call you a monster i think this is an important lesson about dealing with conflict with someone you love,MLeek
the change is you have to be actively trying to make it easier for her to come to you with negative messages you both need that from each other and that is hard work for you both it seems to be a trust that is missing here you cannot fix this alone  shell have to put the work in too  but you absolutely can ruin it on your own and you can damage that trust super quick with just a few careless words or assumptions,MLeek
i think the important thing to recognize is when said things were going well she was probably not actually lying she was telling you the best truth she had available to her at the moment or she might have been rounding it up and focusing on the emotional connection and intimacy instead of her orgasm those arent malicious lies those are choices she was making to try and emphazies the important elements that were totally present for her and not to focus too much on the ones that werent,MLeek
most people dont try to lie to the ones they care about most people tell the truth they have at the moment they have it and on reflection realize there are also other important truths they need to express,MLeek
your first step may be as simple as saying i realize my responses might not be making you feel safe to bring these things to me and that isnt what i want for us im going to work on that because i really need you to come to me with these things,MLeek
you take a huge step back and instead of calling her a liar and blaming her for all the totally valid reasons she was ashamed or afraid of speaking up earlier you make a safe space and show you are someone she can talk to by saying ok im listening now in order for this to work you have to be able to trust me even if im not into something we can talk about it,MLeek
i understand youre hurting but so is she and she probably has been for a while,MLeek
youre not going to make this better by centring your bruised ego and accusing her of malice when she was genuinely trying to do the right thing by protecting that ego and placing your sexual pleasure above her own,MLeek
she made a mistake an understandable human mistake,MLeek
the two of you are now fighting a lifetime of sexual shame and conditioning and possibly even ignorance youre not going to win that fight with more shame and blame and accusations all that response tells her is that she was right that should have kept on protecting your ego or youll get mad with her you gotta be the bigger person here or nothing good happens,MLeek
equally valuable yes,MLeek
equally accessible not always,MLeek
recognize that some of your wifes hobby also checks required labour boxes like some basic home maintenance and child enrichment activities so while your desired activity is checking only one box relaxationrecharge she is multitasking its not unusual for some productive hobbies to get a larger share of time just because they achieve other goals simultaneously ie someone who loves to cook or bake might spend more time at the activity but there was still a baseline of time required to that activity to begin with,MLeek
other hobbies can be prohibitively expensive or require getting a group together for extended periods and for that reason get far fewer hours really dedicated to them,MLeek
equally valuable and worthy of respect is not necessarily the same getting equal hours in the week dedicated to them,MLeek
if you need more downtime ask for it clearly and carve it out but i think tying to fight for if you spend x hours in your garden then i get x hours to veg out is really missing the point entirely and setting up a false comparison where you are going to come out looking petty and foolish even if you are expressing totally valid need for more relaxing time that need should be respected equally but it doesnt necessarily mean the same number of hours should be booked off,MLeek
it sounds like a core incompataiblity,MLeek
if by recent you mean a few weeks then perhaps allow a bit more time for her to sit with the idea and consider it,MLeek
but if by recent you mean a few months of dating then shes not responding from a place of surprise or having never considered this at all shes just telling you straight up she values being closer to her family and youre not compatible,MLeek
you need to date closer to home people with established lives are unlikely to move just for a relationship for most people there need to be other motivators as well bringing them to your area to make this successful,MLeek
youre telling these guys they arent worth a 20 nonrefundable risk once per month,MLeek
they are gonna find that hurtful and your refusal to commit earlier for better seats as disrespectful and thats valid they are your plan b youre making that totally clear,MLeek
maintaining healthy relationships involves some cost and some compromise if youre not willing to eat this cost or manage this compromise then youre probably gonna damage these friendships and you might not maintain this connection its not complicated its something you have to decide and you have to address,MLeek
there is no magic spell that makes them 100 okay with what you want what you want is hurtful and not respectful of what they value if you cannot find a compromise or accept a risk then you need to optout and join in a separate seatorder once youre ready to buy thats the nonasshole approach,MLeek
dude suggest someone else manage the purchase if your priorities and planning dont fit with the groups preferences and needs,MLeek
be gracious be a grownup its not disrespectful to have your own system it is disrespectful not to be open to change when they say its not working for them address the feelings and the issue in the obvious way youre not the right one of the three of you to be buying the tickets maybe someone else should do it,MLeek
the judgment youre heaping on them for just being different people with different preferences and priorities than you is just really petty and meanspirited,MLeek
the point of the thing is to not be an asshole with people in your life you want to keep in your life,MLeek
you are treating them like plan b and thats fine but stop getting your knickers in a knot because they have the audacity to know that youre treating them like plan b,MLeek
hand over the responsibility of booking the tickets and maybe the transfer of the account itself if youre a real mensch to someone else and accept that if you get a better offer some friday and cancel on them you might be the one out the cost of your movie ticket if you hold steady on this youre torching your friendship and disrespecting something they really value over the possible cost of a few movie tickets a year on your end,MLeek
i mean i think its a bit embarrassing when 40yearolds use ig as a public record of their spank bank to be perfectly honest,MLeek
but the insecurities issues are your own speak to your therapist about those,MLeek
if youre not going to request different boundaries on socials from your partner which you could certainly do and they could say yes or no then dont go looking for things you know will only make you unhappy exercise some selfcontrol and keep working with your therapist,MLeek
you dont want to spend time with her this week you didnt plan to you dont want to it doesnt just seem that way it is that way and that needs to be okay,MLeek
stop accusing her of malice if on some level she did do this to get more time together then simply make that plan fail spend your time as you planned too take a walk or a ride on your own meet up with a friend encourage and agree with her that she needs to manage her mental health the way she thinks is best  and largely leave her to it  just because youre not at work doesnt mean you are available as a caregiver at all times,MLeek
youre being immature and petty the only difference between these situations is your ego was the one bruised this time and your motivated reasoning to define it as somehow a bigger betrayal but your choices were innocent its total bullshit and you ought to know it,MLeek
if you want to be with her actually with her stop being a chicken shit and do the work stop stringing her along stop allowing yourself to be strung along either be together now both of you stop pressuring others in any way or dont,MLeek
no one else can tell you what choice to make or promise you itll work out but the obvious glaring problem here is that you two keep stalling out on the road to a relationship shit or get off the pot,MLeek
you are 19 it might suck but you need to do better than this even if you were paying her rent youd still owe another human being in the house youre staying in a bit better than what youve expressed here,MLeek
boundaries are good assumptions shes trying to control or manipulate you  without any evidence  are harmful to everyone involved including yourself,MLeek
frankly your mom comes across here as even more toxic than the new gf,MLeek
i understand being uncomfortable and having boundaries but you also need to realize that you have the power to decide not to feel guilty or obligated you have the ability to accept a gift like a young adult and acknowledge when nothing but basic friendliness is expected in return,MLeek
in the future if you feel this strongly about rent you need to make the agreement about rent before you arrive once youre there if she says youre a guest and you dont need to pay there isnt much you can about it maybe buy the three of you takeout once a week as a way to acknowledge and thank them,MLeek
until and unless this woman actually does try to hold her gifts against you find a damn bit of chill that doesnt mean accepting everything she offers but it does mean acting like an adult house guest and not an angry adolescent who isnt getting their way,MLeek
no store should be telling a total stranger about another customers purchases or habits but sending them photos and asking them to ban her is just silly you may embarass her out of it but did you really think a bookstore is gonna refuse her money,MLeek
this woman might be annoying and you should keep doing the dishes and keep your eyes open for other ways to contribute to the household but you also need to take it down like 9 notches and stop assuming malice just because your mom has her knickers in a bunch,MLeek
this makes me wonder if your bf believes that all familial relationships are basically womans work and that you should just be making this perfect for him without him needing to do anything at all,MLeek
my ex and his family was like this just a few months into dating they found it appalling that i picked up a mothers day card for my own mom but didnt get one for his mom who i had met once basically they were fine with him forgetting birthdays and events when he was single  just a man cant be helped  but as soon as he had a gf they all assumed it was the gfs job to keep track of these things,MLeek
youre not at all crazy i dont know what the red flags were but assuming you were not telling nasty lies about him then you made a very normal human mistake and most healthy people understand that ventinganxiety in a new relationship isnt the same as the relationship being all bad or toxic your family has given every sign of understanding that,MLeek
so for him now the simple answer is yes,MLeek
yes i am holding you accountable for your current choices to reject my familys invitations and opportunities to build a relationship with them yup i am putting the responsibility for your current choices the ones you are making today on you,MLeek
hes entitled to his feelings it may be awkward or uncomfortable at times but fundamentally what this guy is telling you is that youre not worth it your family and your family events arent worth him putting in the work or really any work to move this situation forward,MLeek
at this point you have to acknowledge he may not want this fixed not really he may just enjoy his blanket excuse to opt out of any adult responsibilities towards your family and nothing short of treating him like king charles will be considered acceptably friendly to meet his standards,MLeek
your bf is being extremely weird and i suspect he doesnt want this fixed on some level hes enjoying lording it over you,MLeek
its not all normal to expect your adults gfs family to text you or call you to chat,MLeek
he is invited that is how your family is welcoming and its appropriate hes invited and hes refusing to go because its not good enough that is childish to say the least,MLeek
youve done what you need to do it,MLeek
your family is inviting him in,MLeek
it is his responsibility to show up and be himself a nice version of himself,MLeek
that is literally all he has to do and hes refusing to do it,MLeek
you made a mistake years ago but everyone involved besides him is being reasonable about it and ready and willing to move past it with just a tiny bit of effort required,MLeek
its becoming another and very real red flag that he is not willing to show up for you and do his part,MLeek
there is no shame in being a bit thirsty but save yourself some drama and dont be shocked when a 20something hookup behaves like a 20something hookup,MLeek
one of the benefits of being in your 30s is supposed to be not getting so hung up on this bullshit anymore if you want to sleep with him tell him so and invite him over ya want to date him tell him so and suggest a date not half as complicated as youre making it,MLeek
eh your mother doesnt have high standards shes bigoted and biased and stigmatizes mental illness and divorce who says broken family is 2023 a family changes often for the better after a separation of unhappy adults,MLeek
id much rather date an adult who sought treatment for mental health issues and is now stable than an adult who never admitted they needed help it can cause issues but most of those issues arise from the refusal to seek treatment and acknowledge the problem if he took the right steps and is stable now i wouldnt be concerned,MLeek
thank your mother for her concern then follow your own judgment,MLeek
you need to walk away,MLeek
either she is too immature and unstable to offer you a healthy relationship or she is actually abusive and using these threats as a tactic to get the behaviour she wants out of you to keep you insecure and chasing her approval,MLeek
frankly it sounds like its the latter she is doing this just to maintain control and keep you too scarred to ever ask for or expect better for yourself,MLeek
but either way its not a relationship you should stay in,MLeek
two things you need to accept,MLeek
1 this isnt the life you want hes not offering you what you need and you do need a partner who isnt an active addict,MLeek
2 you dont know hed be a good partner otherwise thats a fantasy and a hope not a knowable thing,MLeek
youre gambling with your life and its a bet that might not pay out even if he does get sober which he is not doing,MLeek
not your circus not your monkeys,MLeek
you said your piece and im sure you meant well  at first,MLeek
now its time to stop badgering these adults with your opinions and judgments they are doing just fine you need to handle yourself,MLeek
three months in and hes dismissive and unable to handle conflict,MLeek
this wasnt just about your issues this is about his issues he may not have consciously weaponized your vulnerability but he used it to avoid addressing his own shit or his own inadequacies,MLeek
dont overthink it it was three months a perfectly normal amount of time to really like someone but realize they arent offering what you need in a partner,MLeek
each couple gets to decide,MLeek
but practically speaking if you are legally married then your money is combined in many ways  even if you have no insight into it,MLeek
asking for some exact  of change on one day seems entirely beside the point and not really all the helpful information unless hes selling today at some sort of major profit its not really information that means much,MLeek
however asking for enough transparency and knowledge so you could take care of both peoples financials if they were in a coma for six months thats my rule of thumb i have never combined finances but we have shared retirement goals we update one another on at least one a year and we make sure the other person knows enough about our accountsinsurancedebtetc to that if one of us was in a coma for six months what needs to get taken care of would get taken care of,MLeek
the fact youre feeling insecure and uncertain about your future is a problem that needs to be addressed,MLeek
if you dont want to date someone whose ex is also a close childhood friend stop dating that person,MLeek
youre giving this guy way too much power hes not an evil mindcontrol wizard if his existence was an issue in the past it was an issue for one or both of you he didnt make the relationship spoiled you two didnt maintain it,MLeek
youve told her  with your actions  that you cannot be trusted to respond reasonably to her friendship with this person not even in a group setting so now she hides that friendship and her choices because she doesnt enjoy how you treat her when you are met with that reality shes not unhappy with her boundaries shes unhappy with your behaviour,MLeek
if you need her to observe different boundaries you can ask for them clearly trying to shame her into doing what you want by saying shes not respecting herself is gross if that is what you think of her dont date her,MLeek
people who pressure you are asshats,MLeek
i didnt drink from 19 to about 26 having fun with people who are drinking is definitely a skill and a practice i never felt like i was missing out on being wild because it was actually the loss of control i didnt enjoy but i definitely felt less interesting or plain its hard to remember that they are the ones being irrationally confident  youre fine,MLeek
to hide among the drinkers id ask for a coke is a short glass and people assumed my drink was a rum and coke its a pricy way to fake it but in groups where i didnt feel like explaining myself it works,MLeek
people who arent asshats arent really thinking about you at all,MLeek
yes it was terrible that partners urgent care and months in hospital costs us less than 2k outta pocket and we are  both now back at work as a productive and healthy members of the community instead of me being broke or even homeless and him being dead,MLeek
also hate my basic physical autonomy as a person who may experience an unwanted pregnancy some day,MLeek
some will and hell be peddling male supplements and prepper supplies to make ends met like alex jones if his do not compete allows it,MLeek
tucker was bad habit tv most people will replace the habit they will get their hit but they arent necessarily loyal to tucker theyll be asking their friends where they get theirs now that the guy with good stuff is doing 2 years in federal same as any addict,MLeek
it really just sounds like hes listing the ways a lot of men loss a lot of money,MLeek
the amount the guys i know lost on crypto put my scented candle collection to shame theyd have been better off scrolling instagram,MLeek
this is rude and inconsiderate behaviour of those around you,MLeek
given your age there is a risk someone will say something nasty to you and nastier to her for letting you,MLeek
i would suggest you keep sexual touching private you know this touching is sexual thats why youre enjoying it so keep it private,MLeek
i honestly dont understand,MLeek
no one involved here seems to think anything happened except that she invited an old friend and a friend of a friend to a different public gathering of many friends,MLeek
all that i can see here that might have happened is your dude friend wanted to stir up some misery and drama in your life and found a super lame and weak excuse to do so which shamed you into a breakup,MLeek
after two years i wouldnt assume my gf wanted to fuck someone else just because she invited him to an afterparty its weird you seemed to however if that is what you thought then its best to be broken up,MLeek
being upset isnt getting you anywhere you need to start to be very clear about when you will be prioritizing your own family  even without him  and when you would like him to put his phone down and be present with you,MLeek
youve allowed a dynamic to form in this relationship that you are not happy with you need to tell him plainly its not okay and its going to be renegotiated you will be spending your time a bit differently and he will be expected to be respectful of that,MLeek
dating is really hard work its worse than finding a job it sucks,MLeek
but you did have really good dates that is what happened and its what should happen if youre mature and selfaware you should have mostly good dates but good isnt good enough to build a lifetime of romance and compatibility on and that is okay most good dates after two or three of them are gonna result in one of you saying eh youre good people but youre not my person,MLeek
if youre having largely good dates thats perfect thats really great thats what you want if you were mostly having totally shitty and disappointing dates then youd need to seriously reevalute your choices,MLeek
all you need to do here is realize its work its hard work it is often disappointing work it takes a shit ton of time outta your day if you are really burnt out on the work take a pause for a few months and then come back to it resilience is the name of the game for you resilience and remembering that good doesnt have to be good enough not for them and not for you,MLeek
ill take you one further employees and clients do this schoolchildren do this human beings do this its a normal part of human relationships forming sex and love isnt the only place were looking for compatibility and understanding of boundariesterms the engagement,MLeek
i have never shited tested on purpose but ive had two guys accuse me of it and they were both totally own goals,MLeek
one i asked plainly about his views on abortion mine were right up front in my profile and i dont date men who disagree with me on this subject and he refused to answer because it was a shittest so i unmatched and moved on,MLeek
then i had another guy accuse me of shittesting once because he suggested a restaurant where i had previously had an allergic reaction so i suggested another nearby and very similar where i could eat more comfortably,MLeek
he absolutely went off on me about shittesting him and gameplaying if it hadnt been so spooked by it itd have been really funny my only intention was to have a pleasant meal i could enjoy,MLeek
both cases they created shittests out of normal direct human communication by failing so utterly,MLeek
then im with udfahnz,MLeek
i dont know why youre trying to force this after three months,MLeek
youre calling her controlling demanding and unkind and thinking she cantwont change these patterns if your assumptions are unfair  you shouldnt date her anymore anyways if your beliefs are bang on  you definitely shouldnt date her anymore,MLeek
youve had fun for three months but that was casual intellectual fun i wonder if you are a bit more attracted to the idea of the clever concert pianist then the actual woman who is there the life you actually want to live daytoday does not sound like its going to be with her,MLeek
edit it always depends on the dog and the situational trigger but definitely make sure you encourage other adults who visit your home to help you by immediately becoming unfun if the dog jumps on them any big reaction positive or negative reinforce the behaviour if the dog is smart enough to know the behaviour is undesirable you start rewarding them for better choices ie a greeting that takes place on all fours or a good back up or off if youre really struggling get a pro involved,MLeek
first things first the dog shouldnt be jumping on anyone that actually is a training situation where perfection is the fair expectation its up there with no biting one dog lover to another you need to step up your game the expectation of not being jumping is not excessively demanding or controlling  especially not if you two want to be parents with this dog in the household  and is one you should be working seriously to meet by the time the dog is a year old very very few of my dogs were still jumping with any frequency by 1 year old,MLeek
the second thing is you dont actually sound as independent and confident as you think you are,MLeek
you sound like youre taking good advicefeedbackexpectations when she gives that but call it demanding when you dont like it instead of saying youre a smart woman but no thats ones not for me thanks,MLeek
the fact the dog kept her up is a problem a problem that should be solved by a simple im sorry the dog kept you up i understand that was really unpleasant for you itll happen sometimes but we do need to minimize it next time please wake me up so i can handle the situation and we can all get back to sleep,MLeek
i think you need to step back and realize your girlfriends directness and transparency can be a good thing when you meet it with equal transparency confidence selfknowledge and directness,MLeek
maybe she is a deeply toxic and unkind person trying to change you maybe shes abusive i really cannot tell what i can see here is that you take what is useful to you and get quietly pissed with her for what you dont like and try to force yourself to accept it you also need to learn to take the good with the bad and stand up for yourself clearly when you disagree with her that is when you will know if shes just a forceful person with decent conflict resolution skills or an abusive bully,MLeek
at 3 months you probably also want to have some of the tougher conversations about what life together would look like you want a dog for the rest of your life they are a member of the family as much as a child be clear that that dog wont be rehome for any reason except extremely and immediate safety situations ie the dog starts mauling people youre 39 you should also think of some of the other dealbreakers its time to discuss plainly like plans and values around money or homeownership or faith and family,MLeek
you can mute the chat or leave it and tell them why,MLeek
its just not a positive and healthy space for you right now it may be what they need but its exactly what you need to take some space from they arent doing anything terribly wrong you just need to stand up and leave the frontrow seat of a show youre not enjoying,MLeek
ask them to reach out to you via other channels when they want to get together and thank them for their support and understanding,MLeek
you need to be willing to take care of yourself no one else is gonna read your mind and do it for you,MLeek
i agree we dont need their language or framing,MLeek
we have a lot of healthier genderneutral words this phase of a human relationship where boundaries are tested and we figure out another out storming doubt stage hide and seek stage the power struggle the honeymoon hangover,MLeek
and men do it plenty im dealing with a new hire who cannot string 10 words together with shittesting his coworkers or managers either were going to move through this phrase or were gonna dissolve the relationship this isnt evil women this is a normal social strategy you can observe in a kindergarten classroom,MLeek
the way the puaincel defines shit testing is inherently malicious and immature and only assigned to women but in reality its a normal part of human relationships forming even in the workplace and its can be benign or even helpful,MLeek
hes abusive,MLeek
when someone says you make me be cruel there is no grey zone that is the battle cry of the unrepentant abuser,MLeek
he feels entitled to call you nasty names if he uses the threat of breaking up each time hes not getting his way that is also a common abuse tactic this will not get better and might get worse,MLeek
you explained fine he choose to doubledown on accusing you these kinds of misunderstandings are frequent in relationships its a red flag when a man of 30 cannot handle them without making absolute absurd accusations,MLeek
tell him that is not fair or true if he cannot accept misunderstandings with a bit of grace and respect you shouldnt be wasting your time with him,MLeek
either he is terribly immature or this is a tactic hes using to keep you proving yourself and feeling insecure in the relationship either way you should expect better,MLeek
your bf knows how he treats other women at parties he assumes all men do the same,MLeek
this isnt just the controlling hypocrisy of it its also him telling on himself he knows how he behaves is wrong but feels entitled to it,MLeek
dont dare someone who feels entitled to behave badly,MLeek
you cant fix a person with poly it requires even more open discussion about boundaries and comfort not less someone who busts boundaries and neglects their partners feelings and doesnt communicate openly in a monogamous relationship isnt gonna suddenly start doing those things right in a poly on,MLeek
i think you need to have a serious think about what youre trying to fix in this relationship,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
let it go,MLeek
you didnt go any further than they did,MLeek
tell your husband that being a bit embarrassed or uncomfortable is totally understandable  just like you were  but if you can have a laugh about it surely he can as well,MLeek
if hed like to discuss how you can both observe different boundaries about privacy and sex in the future thats great have that conversation about what is off limits,MLeek
youre not concerned that your bf tried to negotiate a polyeqsue situation with another woman staying in your home without talking to you first because thats a bad start,MLeek
there are reddits specifically for polyamory and nonmonogamy and you might get more advice there but i have had openenm relationships most of my life and frankly the way your bf behaved with you and with a vulnerable woman staying in your home does not sound the least bit ethical i wouldnt offer a person anything if they tried to create a threesome or more  without talking to me their partner first,MLeek
it sounds like youre trying to manage a man who you know will cheat on you thats never a good place to come at this from,MLeek
its a fairly common fantasy that fuels a huge percentage of the science fiction and fantasy stories we have,MLeek
can you explain a bit more about what makes you uncomfortable about these conversations does she want to do harm to certain kinds of people does she not listen to feedback or is pushy with her friends about her imagined authority,MLeek
if she is basically expressing impossible wishes for the world to be kinder or safer for other people  and doesnt see that happening  i think shes probably just at an immature stage of a social justice conscience and i really wouldnt worry about it,MLeek
certainly have a back up plan in place,MLeek
this man is controlling and abusive he may also have a very genuine sensitivity but the way hes addressing it is not acceptable,MLeek
i would suggest you tell the wife you will no longer be cooking its not comfortable or reasonable for you to feel like youre taking a risk each time you feed the children its cannot be your responsibility if this is the behaviour that is going on in the home,MLeek
i wouldnt be willing to stay till september but if you do definitely have a back of plan of a quick safe place to stay this is a pretty toxic situation and you want to be able to leave quickly if needed you should not feel secure here,MLeek
yeah thats how most bigotry works,MLeek
basically good people need to be on guard and thoughtful or they end up reflecting and acting on it,MLeek
intent is nice buts its not everything and its doesnt cure anything kindness is work not a hope not a feeling not an intent a thing you have to actually do,MLeek
so you have no advice you have a shallow pedantic platitude that is vague shaming and silencing of totally legitimate boundaries and criticisms  for the others sincerely trying to help,MLeek
the sister did her parents decided her cooking wasnt up to par,MLeek
perfectly reasonable that she stopped trying to contribute in that way if that is the feedback she got,MLeek
if he lost 11 lbs in a month he probably needs to speak to a doctor that is what you should be on him about immediately,MLeek
no one is refusing to feed him,MLeek
hes refusing to eat,MLeek
hes hypercritical of both your mother and your sister and he wont eat there is food he has a car arguably knows where stores are he appears to be competent and can solve problems in his life he has chosen not too,MLeek
you cannot fix this but try to find a doctor wholl give him a talking too and to build that relationship incase there is something else going on here medically or cognitively tell your father hes an adult and is capable of keeping himself basically healthy it is disappointing that he is blaming others for his behaviour and you are concerned for his health if he doesnt change his actions,MLeek
no hes almost certainly not,MLeek
he is almost certainly toying with you because you havent told him youre not a plaything but a colleague the same as any of the men,MLeek
take a huge step back from him avoid hun like the plague when booze is involved this is not your friend hes using his wife to get a green card hes using you to feel good at work,MLeek
this is not safe emotional investment or a wise move for your career youre becoming a subject of office gossip huge huge step back from this personal connection,MLeek
its not a positive conversation he treated op in a way that is unacceptable  the only reason its a conversation is because it is out of character,MLeek
if you have advice offer it but i dont believe in holding peoples hands when are being cruel i start with i think this is cruel and i need you to stop it from there we can move forward,MLeek
i mean there is almost certainly some misogyny going on here he tried to demand she make herself ugly so she wouldnt rebound too fast thats not happening in a vacuum and suggests hes got a few concerning ideas about women and men going on here,MLeek
but yes if something isnt a pattern better to start with a firm this is not okay we can talk about what youre going through and what you are feeling but you need to know i am not going to accept being treated this way,MLeek
is dropping by his desk for an actual chat a possibility,MLeek
personally i really dont think its that rude to ignore a nonwork related chat for that long im an avid user of slack but my expectations for responses are entirely different if im asking a work question or if im asking how their cat is doing,MLeek
but you are right it is a struggle to make connections without some text chatting perhaps it would help to give yourself an assignment and carve out a few minutes in your day to catch up with text messages you may never enjoy it but if you treat it as a necessary task that needs to be performed in order to maintain social connections you can probably do it fine,MLeek
meeting people to date is really more like a shitty part time job than a fun hobby i dont think there is anything wrong with admitting that and just doing the work to get you where you want to be,MLeek
i am shocked that suggesting you should trust your wife she speaks was so upsetting to you,MLeek
its strange that youre arguing for nuance and the need for thoughtful consideration of communication while not be able to exercise much of either but its clear that youve been triggered too severely for me to be helpful good luck,MLeek
as is your right with advice,MLeek
but you asked and she confirmed she was serious you still dont want too risk it with your career,MLeek
youre right youre not being a rational actor youre trying to leverage your assumptions about her mental state and emotions  assumptions that are the exact opposite of what she clearly said  in order to justify the choice you want to make its a reasoning flaw,MLeek
all im advising you to do is make the choice without the part where you treat her like shes the irrational and untrustworthy one you dont need to make assumptions about her feelings to be honest with her about yours,MLeek
by all means marry her but dont try to read her mind to get the outcome you want be transparent with your mind there is nothing childish about that,MLeek
dont marry someone you dont take seriously when they express their needs,MLeek
say no if the choice is no  is the risk is too much and you need to stick to the plan say so  but own that choice for yourself and stop trying to justify it by demeaning and condescending to her and telling yourself its okay to not believe her when she speaks that will come back to bite you,MLeek
thats a lot of words to say that you have a type,MLeek
you probably should be way more concerned that youre repeating toxic patterns in your own relationships then you should be that people of a similar age in an similar area connected with another as friends,MLeek
open with that then this is extremely out of character and im not cool with how we left it im deeply concerned youd behave this way and im looking for a reasonable explanation for the totally unkind and unreasonable way youre treating me right now,MLeek
the only thing they can do is try to tell the gf which puts them back in the line of fire for their abuser,MLeek
she doesnt have the information she needs in order to protect anyone here except herself,MLeek
so no i dont agree that is likely to achieve anything or that op has a responsibility to set herself on fire over things she cannot prove or protect anyone else from,MLeek
he probably is im sorry but youre right,MLeek
unless thats a crime where you live then there is nothing you can do about it even if it is one there is probably still nothing you can do if hes just showing then to friends and not posting them publicly,MLeek
thats a reality youre going to have to live with it shouldnt be i wish i could stop it for you but i cant the safest thing for you is have absolutely zero contact of any kind with him or anyone close to him,MLeek
tell him this doesnt wait until you maybe get more serious he has an intelligent highenergy breed he needs to be taking proper care of right now and proper care includes training,MLeek
if he doesnt take it seriously now he never really will maybe hell let it be your job and hell resist you every step of the way,MLeek
in your position id be brutally clear i cannot respect people who do not train their young dogs to be safe around people and dogs the fact hes decided to just not bother right now is a real mark against his character,MLeek
there is no crime to report,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely bringing your concerns to his new gf will do anything besides trigger harassment,MLeek
there is nothing productive you can do sometimes bad things are just bad and there is nothing to do about it,MLeek
you need to block both of them everywhere you cannot punish him or save her,MLeek
that is a bizarrely shallow and controlling sentiment hes expressing he wants you to make yourself in his mind unappealing to other men out of respect yuck does he also expect you to be wear a black veil for a year and then purples and greys for at least six more months after that,MLeek
my bf and i were joking about death recently and he told me to use some of his life insurance to buy a really good vibrator if i didnt feel like playing cougar right away,MLeek
i would suggest you not try to make this right he issued an amazingly petty shittest tell him it was both bizarre and unkind for him to try to dictate how you might theoretically grieve like he doesnt trust you to be actually devastated by his death he needs to imagine youll also need to make yourself again he imagines ugly to ensure you dont immediately start dating again that insane,MLeek
break up with him and end all contact,MLeek
he cheated because he wanted to cheat nothing you ever did made him do it you didnt cast a spell hes a person who can choose not to be shit he choose to cheat and hes telling you hes gonna do it again,MLeek
this will all make a lot more sense when you stop talking to this manipulative piece of shit person,MLeek
i think its silly not to accept what is basically market rate from your gf,MLeek
if you stick to your plan and shes truly not comfortable with it then shell simply end up paying more elsewhere anyways,MLeek
you might also consider connecting with any schoolscolleges in the area and trying to find a short term lodger 36 months i did this a little while to supplement my income but so as not to commit to anyone long term where i live they also pay a bit more and if there is a serious problem you can let their school know,MLeek
its just compatibility,MLeek
telling the truth did exactly what it is supposed too,MLeek
it was better to find out now than later that you were youre going to be incompatible with lots of people for one reason or another if you were incompatible in this way its absurdly unlikely that you were magically perfect for another in all others these things tend to spill over,MLeek
ah thank you you too,MLeek
although in all honesty mine is so far behind me now i really dont look back at it with anything a sense of humour and gratitude that i stayed basically safe part of current awesomeness,MLeek
my little brother made the mistake of pulling this women wouldnt fight in ww3 bullshit on us last week,MLeek
he has type 2 diabetes asthma and is nearsighted he will have a desk job every single one of his sisters is way way more likely to see combat than he is,MLeek
i dont know who the imagine that housework is being done for like just for ourselves would be grand but not economically viable the exact opposite happened last time industry ramped up the women went to work,MLeek
im sorry you went through this it does suck but it really wasnt about you it was all about him being able to keep the mask up until anything was expected of him besides easy words,MLeek
am i right to assume his divorce was really resent and hes still very bitter and inexperienced at living alone cause women his own age probably wouldnt touch him with a ten foot pole if he was acting this way they would definitely bail the moment he accused them of being emotionally abusive  like his ex now you know as well what to listen for take the lesson but dont take it personally its not about you its about him still performing his old toxic patterns  hes not trying to avoid them in you he was trying to enforce them on you,MLeek
can see why this man is a divorcee who picked an ldr with a woman a decade younger than him,MLeek
dont take it too personally be proud of yourself for confronting him on his shitty inconsiderate behaviour that took some stones its not a cultural thing it a selfish person thing tell him its over and then block him dont bother trying to explain anymore im sure his exwife told him over and over again until she lost her voice,MLeek
no shaming of sex workers or sustained celebrators intended,MLeek
i remember my hook up years when my standards were rock bottom and i was chasing self worth through dating and casual sex,MLeek
and 3 new men a week who could string a sentence together and brush their damn their teeth while also working 50 hours and being an adult impossible absolutely not happening not one week ever not if i spent every waking moment swiping and chatting,MLeek
i know a few sex workers and i dont think even their average week includes three new clients,MLeek
our bodies dont exist except as products on a shelf,MLeek
thats gross i really hope that is an esl issue because this is not a respectful way for him to speaking about these women and it sounds like both have some difficulties with respecting the women in this sport,MLeek
if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him,MLeek
we cannot read his mind any better than you can if that is what you think of him and his temper act accordingly,MLeek
no you cannot find out you have trust and respect or not,MLeek
if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him,MLeek
because that appears to be what you are saying and you must see that is an insane thing to think about a person and then stay with them,MLeek
except you dont not when you assume hes letting them win or they are fundamentally of less value to him as a competitors than a man would be respect isnt a claim its a practice,MLeek
do you want to be an athlete and wrestle with men,MLeek
if not then yes that is a possible hypocrisy but its also picking a fight about something you dont even want for yourself anyways,MLeek
you need to get a grip if you trust him trust him when he tells you what is normal in the sport he practices,MLeek
you are misunderstanding a culture which should be rooted mutual respect and sportsmanship  and often is you are underestimating how much skills can matter and you are severely underestimating these pro woman no one is letting them win,MLeek
women participate in the sport with men and his explanation is plausible with nothing else to go on these women deserve your respect as athletes,MLeek
the issue here is not the sport,MLeek
if you otherwise trust him and your conflict resolution remains healthy and productive i would advise you to let go of this entirely,MLeek
love it,MLeek
even if we assumed every single woman on of was an active creator of sexual content and was an american woman between 18 and 35 ya still get 19 of roughly the 55 million american woman between 18 and 35 with an of account,MLeek
and they arent all american or all selling sex and only an even smaller minority are active so even with the most generous take on this its less than 2 roughly the same percentage of women who leave their christmastree up till february,MLeek
strange way to tell us that the algorithm knows youre not interested in content from women unless they have an of,MLeek
all in all youre dating a person who doesnt have much bandwidth or skills to deal with a normal disappointments and daily struggles in his own life  and judges and mischaracterizes your struggles because of his own limits and lack of awareness he may not be consciously projecting but it doesnt really matter end result is the same even if hes not malicious about it he has been consistent about telling you what support he can offer and consistent in his refusal to seek treatment,MLeek
hes not being consistently kind youre not compatible,MLeek
as a 25 year old who has embraced treatment and learned the skills she needs to find success in her own terms you probably actually have less in common when him than you do many neurotypicals,MLeek
you apologize,MLeek
you acknowledge youre both angry and that being angry with him for not waking you wasnt entirely fair,MLeek
you admit that while its not his job you probably should be asking him for the favour of the occasional wake up  because you have a medical condition you cannot perfectly control thats not making it his job that is asking for his support with something that isnt his job,MLeek
and you probably have to do some listening to some frustration and unhappiness he has as well hes probably pissed too and hes got about the same rights to it as you do,MLeek
and then you probably talk to your doctor about some sleep aids if youve already done everything you can on your own to manage your sleep hygiene,MLeek
yeah youre the asshole here,MLeek
if he had agreed that on this one day he would wake you by x time so you two could stick to your shared plans then youre be justified in being angry with him for not doing so,MLeek
but thats not what happened what actually happened in the vague plans kept on shifting and he didnt really know what was to do when you fell back asleep he likely felt rationally that he was gonna piss you off regardless of what he did he didnt have information to act on feelings are not instructions or directions to be woken or left to sleep,MLeek
right now youre pissed with him for not doing something he didnt agree to do which you didnt ask him to do and both agree he fundamentally shouldnt be expected to do,MLeek
being disappointed in the situation is totally fair being angry with him was not youre both frustrated with something medical right now that neither of you can perfectly solve,MLeek
you need to ask for what you need clearly i would suggest in the short term being clear with him that if youre sleeping through commitments with him you would appreciate him waking you up so you can keep those plans,MLeek
he cannot be your human alarm clock everyday but he can and should be able to come and get ya when you two have agreement,MLeek
thats not totally fair,MLeek
men also use it against men when its convenient to them to argue that all men are biologically programmed to be unfaithful or sexually violent,MLeek
the loss part of this is what is wildest,MLeek
any halfway sane woman hearing that would be calling a lawyer and opening accounts without his name on them people loose their jobs all the time someone who raided the family saving account to immediately pay off their employer is not just getting laid off,MLeek
this guy seems to thinks loving him means turning off your rational brain and walking joyfully in to the jail cell beside him,MLeek
i have this theory that women arent bullying one another enough anymore to create enough insecure women willing to date me so i have to get way better at lying to women to work around the amount of mutual respect they have for one another and now expect from men i tell extravagant lies like i respect you and acknowledge your value as a person instead of ugly truths like you actually have no value as a human being if i dont find you personally fuckable and available,MLeek
i fucked up at my job so badly i was fired and i was financially liable and paid it from our savings cause ya know were married its probably not just mine but no lets not discuss it further and im gonna just chill at home for the next two weeks while you panic and  hah not psych lol you should have seen your face wait why are your bags packed,MLeek
without knowing what the thing is its impossible to form much of an opinion on the risk to the relationship and if your anxiety is something you simply need to manage yourself,MLeek
your boyfriend is nearly 30 doesnt have his life together in the least has a history of cheating and instability in general and is 100 going to sleep with this woman after moving in with her,MLeek
get yourself sorted find an affordable for place for yourself and a job if youre going to school you might find they have resources to help you find a room or a job that fits with your schedule most schools want you to keep paying tuition so they may have some advice for you definitely call them and try to find someone to speak to before you move back to a parent who isnt supportive,MLeek
when youre 29 youre gonna look back at this guy at his choices and his emotional manipulation and your mind is going to boggle,MLeek
keep on loving him if you want but dont be an idiot keep your financial and home life completely separate he cant be trusted partner when it comes to money or a place to live,MLeek
dude you got rejected by someone you chatted with for a few days whose intentions were right there in her profile,MLeek
this isnt a pattern this is not a friendzoning and you are far too old to use that word,MLeek
this is a person who was always offering you friendship and you were disappointed by that,MLeek
given your feelings you should probably decline her offer of friendship,MLeek
you cannot fix this for her she needs to acknowledge it is unhealthy and do better for her own sake as well as the relationships,MLeek
and that is really unlikely to happen,MLeek
youre being played,MLeek
hes in debt deep which means you are too you need to stop the bleeding,MLeek
you flirted with an ex you did cheat anyone sane would consider that a violation of the relationship agreement,MLeek
stop being a dipshit admit what you did recognize that getting dumped for it is perfectly fair reasonable,MLeek
its strange that you wouldnt begin with husband i want to work towards a mortgage and to do that i need to have a better idea of our financial position  and that includes the business lets book some time to sit down and go over the financial situation together with the accountant,MLeek
the fact hes being vague is what needs to change deal with that reality dont tip toe around it and work behind his back thats isnt going to fix the problems here the finances are only half the equation,MLeek
youre in an abusive relationship,MLeek
hes escalating because your dependency is escalating he doesnt have to work so hard to mask his behaviours any more now that he has you trapped,MLeek
this will continue to escalate if you relocate hes not looking for a way out hes just stockpiling ammunition for the exactly the sort of combative and abusive relationship he wants to have with you,MLeek
deleting the texts was dishonest when you have an open phone policy thats a mistake she could have reasonably understood hed want to know she was in contact with this person and she choose to hide it she violated the spirit of the agreement even if not the the letter,MLeek
its not great what she did  if she was here id be telling her not to date someone she needs to manage like that  but his reactions is the real red flag here,MLeek
she doesnt have to be perfect for his reactions to be deeply concerning,MLeek
i actually agree with this 100 that is what everyone should want and need,MLeek
but you seem to refuse to realize how your behaviour is not communicating that or making much space for that,MLeek
your behaviour  if its anything like its been in this thread  is communicating that you need to be managed and pacified because you cannot control yourself very well,MLeek
we read what you wrote man were listening and discovering your girlfriend was right to be concerned you wouldnt respond reasonably to messages you dont like,MLeek
the only smart thing you did throughout this was take a huge step back when you realize you werent behaving yourself and you needed to go cool down i suggest you do that again because this isnt a problem with explaining to your girlfriend why youre mad that makes perfect sense we all understand why youre mad the place the miscommunication is happening here is your refusal to recognize that she made a reasonable choice to withhold information that you apparently cannot handle what she did was wrong but her judgement was correct about your ability to take the information in calmly it was the wrong choice but it was a totally logical one and you are refusing to acknowledge that which will stall transparent communication in the future,MLeek
the problem does not appear to be her understanding what she did wrong the problem is you realizing that she was totally rational to be fearful of having this conversation with you and you reassuring her and showing her that you can accept upsetting information without acting like an enraged toddler,MLeek
if you cant turn to her and say i understand why you made this mistake and i can promise you that while i may be mad at times in the future i will behave rationally and in a way that will not make you feel unsafe if you need to share information with me that i dont like as long as you can promise me to not repeat this mistake and lie to me to keep me from being angry,MLeek
edit again that is if you believe her if you believe her about what the texts were then also believe her when she said she assumed youd be mad  extremely and irrationally so if you need her to end contact with this person ask for that if you dont believe her break up,MLeek
yeah cannot imagine why a 20 year old might be fearful of giving him a message he dislikes s,MLeek
can you really not see that you are coming across here as totally unhinged and irrationally angry i wouldnt want to talk to you face to face when youre bringing this energy no one would,MLeek
if you suspect cheating break up if you dont grow up,MLeek
this makes perfect sense to anyone who isnt used to using their anger as a tactic to control others get a grip stop throwing a temper tantrum at randos online you asked for advice and the obvious advice is  even when youre right and shes wrong you cannot bring this kind of rage at her and expect transparent communication in the future thats not how people work,MLeek
i dont even know you and based on your words  here id be worried enough by your lack of empathy nd emotional regulation to not want too,MLeek
while she made a mistake i can see why she doesnt trust you to behave reasonably with this information,MLeek
youll never know what really happened here,MLeek
but if you believe her that it was nothing then you need to work on being someone its safe to communicate with as well she was wrong to do what she did but it was a tactic to manage your anger and anxiety for you and this experience will have only confirmed for her that you couldnt be trusted not to explode at her had she told you first,MLeek
while nothing you do will stop someone who really wants to lie to you or manipulate you remember that most of the time you have some ability to teach people how to treat you be careful about teaching her that you are irrationally angry and have to protected from bad news at all costs,MLeek
they grew up together the sister and the h were likely in the same grade sister saw him as a brother figure it wasnt unreasonable for her to assume her little sister saw in the same way she was just incorrect,MLeek
it wasnt ops problem before and its also not now,MLeek
op said there is no pattern of malicious behaviour from her sister there is just a perspective and it was good that op got a moment to address it,MLeek
not everything one person doesnt like or agree with is some sort of monstrous violation,MLeek
just let it go,MLeek
its her opinion its not an insane one she asked you answered,MLeek
shes not being cruel to either of you there isnt really a problem here it can be okay for someone to love you both and have those sorts of questions,MLeek
your plan requires a relationship being a housewife generally requires a breadwinning partner,MLeek
there isnt a problem here unless your family is not respectful of your relationship and how you and your partner choose to organize your lives,MLeek
youre 25 if you have a goal for your own life work towards it you dont need your parents to cosign on it or pat you on the head itd be nice but you need to learn to cope without it they are entitled to their own opinions and perspectives and you are entitled to ignore them,MLeek
if i didnt work so hard she would be very disappointed in the situation it would lead to,MLeek
i think youre projecting your own concerns about your role as a provider and you both are going to keep to accept things in your lives need to be compromised its not just her,MLeek
if you are hiding from her the real costs of your choices as a couple financially and emotionally then she isnt making her own choices and compromises with the full picture so yeah based on the limited information and understanding she has she might be disappointed but unless you think she is a fundamentally really selfish and ignorant human being then that is a matter of understanding one another better and being partners getting on the same team its not a matter of you failing her,MLeek
it might help you to consider this,MLeek
how would your wife survive if you were in a comma for six months does she have enough understanding of the financial situation to be able to keep things together would she know where to find the passwords or who to call if she had questions about the accounts because for both of your sakes she should if you have taken on so much of the burden of understanding and doing the providing role that she wouldnt be capable for six months then you havent set her up for success that is a failure for you both youre all in danger if that is the dynamic that exists right now,MLeek
acknowledge that yes you are prioritizing the game and no you dont want to go for drinks,MLeek
you want to stick to your plan and relax on your own it may involve playing a lot of star wars and it may not either way you like your plan and youre sticking to it,MLeek
sometimes the easiest way to deal with a fight is not to fight acknowledge shes correct you are prioritizing that game over going on a date she has accurately understood and that is okay,MLeek
he has told you plainly he doesnt care about your needs and will not even be discussing them with you as if you are an equal or a person that he values,MLeek
how you communicate isnt the problem here,MLeek
youre not his priority,MLeek
there are no magical phrases you can use to convince him hes decided already,MLeek
he has decided he doesnt have to listen to you,MLeek
anything you say will be labelled wrong or disrespectful or mean,MLeek
you will never ever win he has already decided youve lost everything he is saying now is just designed to keep you afraid and shut you up about it so you accept the situation he prefers,MLeek
wanting to see your partner weekly is reasonable he is not offering that kind of relationship,MLeek
thats the reality you need to stop thinking hes just independent hes an asshole,MLeek
this is probably the core of it,MLeek
he suspected he couldnt give her an inch without her demanding a mile when it came to any communication during this time,MLeek
instead of recognizing that as the huge red flag it really was he tried to enforce this maximalist boundary drawing to a head the fact they are not compatible and she is not someone really anyone should be dating,MLeek
op got to the right outcome but he could have probably wised up a bit sooner and gotten there by a smoother path if he just thought hey i should probably date someone who you can respect and understand when i can only have a very brief contact during this week,MLeek
i also dislike like hyperconnectivity i can go a day or with low or no contact with my so no problem and i dont want to date someone who couldnt,MLeek
however one or two texts during a week especially in the context of a young relationship is not hyperconnectivity it the basic maintenance of a human connection,MLeek
i agree that a healthy secure relationship should be able to manage a week of no contact,MLeek
however that wasnt what this was on either side she was absolutely not healthy or secure and ops inability to fire off a sentence or a damn emoji one or twice over seven days from the toilet also doesnt speak well of him he wasnt deployed or studying the ice in the arctic he made a choice not to give his new relationship 30 seconds of maintenance and consideration even once during this time my father travelled and trained like this all the time he usually called once for less than 15 mins and spent 10 minutes on some break sending a postcard the bar doesnt need to be that high,MLeek
and 20 years ago was only 2003 we all had email many of us had flip phones and we still had pay phones and post cards it was not that unusual to make brief contact with your closest people during holidays  which again this was not,MLeek
yeah we also had different standards for dental hygiene too the mind boggles,MLeek
if youve got legal protections you can seek you could report him,MLeek
but if you dont keep your head down and survive find someplace else to go and thrive where bigots are not given so much power over you,MLeek
break up are usually a healthy kind of selfish like i said a relationship shouldnt be a hostage situation if you want out then you should be out even if your reasons are irrational if you want to break up you still should,MLeek
its normal to feel bad we never enjoy hurting someone else,MLeek
a breakup isnt a negotiation youre not stuck with her just because she doesnt feel like moving back home,MLeek
and a relationship shouldnt just be a convenient social arrangement or a hostage situation,MLeek
break up are really hard and disruptive but if you dont want to be in the relationship anymore it is the hard work you need to do,MLeek
no one here can tell you for sure what it is you want but the reasons youve raised here for staying together itll suck at parties she doesnt want to move home are really shitty reasons to keep working at something you seriously do not want any longer,MLeek
all you need to learn from this is that school and workplace computers are for school work and professional work and that personal questions and research should be done on your own time,MLeek
you know there was plenty of bigotry and bias at play here we all know that we all know that gay men are people and they can fall in love and choose to be couples that isnt porn thats dating or romance or being human there is no reason to try and read other peoples minds and try to poll how many people online are gonna get offended stupid people exist bigoted people exist we cannot pretend they dont and its just beside the point the point is people are assholes and school computers need to be used for school work,MLeek
anytime you are on a device or network owned by your school or employer assume you are being watched by someone and that someone doesnt care about your intent and might be an asshole,MLeek
you need to speak to a therapist,MLeek
youre carrying a lot of resentment towards your wife but it boils down to a broken dynamic and your own struggles advocating for yourself a lot of this is about the expectations youre placing on yourself youre also clearly just burnt out on parenting you really are describing being a fully involved father  which is great but yeah thats like the time a baby takes the labour division might need to be changed up but that is the work,MLeek
i am not saying shes perfect just that you need to do some work to approach these important conversations from a more balanced place for your own sake it sucks that the person with the bigger problem and the larger amount of work often has to be the person who adds a bit more work to their own plate first to start the ball rolling but i think that is where you are at,MLeek
you got a big ball of stress burdens resentments and twisted dynamics to unravel a lot of it is based in your expectations of yourself  some of which seem pretty excessive to me  and the partnership dynamic you have contributed to with your wife when you really lock yourself into a provider role instead of a partnership role you should speak to a therapist about priorities and how to start which conversations with your wife,MLeek
dude you need to find a new story,MLeek
all of this my dad was poors the girl of my dreams was stolen from me is a story a myth from the outsiders perspective there is basically no truth in it all its just you trying to project and assign your insecurities and jealousy to these other people without any rational basis,MLeek
you need to stop clinging to a story that says youre life is over because you missed your chance in your early 20s thats toxic its not what happened ya just experienced a bit of standard rejection imagining shed have fallen in love with you instead if you just had a guest room is really absurd its time to actually accept this rejection without writing a starring role for yourself in an epic tragedy for the ages if you cannot manage and reject these thoughts yourself bring them to a therapist and let them challenge this bullshit,MLeek
doesnt change that it would be a really big ask for a lot of people  even healthy and secure ones,MLeek
but all you can do is be glad you found out quickly this woman was not healthy or secure try to put it out of your mind as well as you can there is nothing you can or need to do until after your exam,MLeek
this is creepy,MLeek
lots of people like to leave their desks at lunch,MLeek
do you really think shes have a 20 minute fuck in a busy parking lot every afternoon you need to get a grip and talk to your wife,MLeek
there is nothing here to discuss escalating baseless accusations of cheating should be an absolute dealbreaker even if the rest of this was not,MLeek
however i will say that with someone who behaves better than this a full week of radio silence is probably not good enough to support many relationships certainly not a new one a few texts throughout the week would be a reasonable ask from a healthy partner  but this woman wasnt that anyways so just keep her on mute and deal with the break up when you return,MLeek
good luck with the exam,MLeek
youre replying as if i called bf the best ever who can do no wrong,MLeek
when what i actually said is this obviously sucks and i have no idea why shed want to keep dating him with all this drama and distrust after only one month,MLeek
when someone brings out the worst in you in terms of insecurities paranoia and controlling tendencies you just get the hell away from that person who brings that out in you no matter how much i appreciate she is genuinely and legitimately hurt i also think this is a terrible version of her and there is probably a better version who is more secure and mature who is dating someone else so we dont need to demonize him when he does something pretty damn reasonable you just get away before the bad dynamic messes you up even more,MLeek
i would refuse to date someone who expected id be constantly available to them via text,MLeek
i dont check my phone with im having a meal with other friends or when im at a concert or a play im out with people and those people or that art will get my full attention if i dont go the bathroom or need to call an uber im not really looking at my phone and its on silent i will sometimes have workdays where i dont respond to any personal texts that arent absolutely vital for a full 12 hours my job is not the kind where you carry a phone on your person at all times,MLeek
i dont know your relationship but i think he did the correct thing in setting the expectation,MLeek
you are being distrustful and a bit controlling and looking for every detail of his night,MLeek
you might also be being misled,MLeek
after a month of this sort of drama i dont know why youd bother continuing with someone you feel this way about it shouldnt be this hard for either of you,MLeek
you have some insecurities to work on if youre going to date like a busy adult with full lives but he also might be a shitty bf its impossible to say and it doesnt even matter this much drama and distrust after only a month this clearly not working for either of you,MLeek
this was utterly juvenile bullshit i wouldnt want to be friends with either of you and im not sure why you want to go on being friends with her after she spun this shit on you,MLeek
you realize shes using to you testbaitpunish her boyfriend right youre not really her friend  she clearly doesnt actually value you in her life that much if she takes dumb risks like this and then cuts you out when they play out poorly youre a tool shes using to treat someone else like shit,MLeek
you cannot do anything except ifwhen this comes up again admit you were wholly and completely wrong and childish af no excuses no explanations just a straightup i shouldnt have done that was shitty i am sorry i dont know why i was so fucking stupid as to imagine it was at all funny,MLeek
cause you were extremely stupid unkind and you have no defence here,MLeek
walk away,MLeek
trust doesnt work on technicalities he chose a very convenient lack of transparency,MLeek
and hes shopping around which may be technically fine in your agreement but you should leave him to it he doesnt need to cheat to be sorta shitty,MLeek
multidating is common but isnt usually a stage that lasts into the five or six months range unless youre nonmonogamousopen so this isnt cultural or about multidating really this is just a lowkey not great human being who is comfortable enough with you and enjoys the benefits of being your sorta boyfriend but is not willing to commit or move forward together,MLeek
after five months of casual but frequent dating its time to move on he doesnt communicate to the standard you should insist on and hes either just not that into you or hes a real shithead either way times up,MLeek
you could ask him for a greater level of commitment and involvement in one anothers lives if youd like but i wouldnt a nearly 50yearold man who chooses the easy white lies for himself where he technically isnt betraying anyone else is just not what im looking for,MLeek
youre never gonna know,MLeek
the best thing to do is not waste any brain power on it,MLeek
thats not cute or clever its awkward if i did like a guy a joke about other men and multiple personalities would turn me right off,MLeek
just tell her what you actually want and then youll find out,MLeek
it is rude to expect to take anything home from it,MLeek
this one is pretty cut and dry youre right hes wrong he has misunderstood the situation,MLeek
it is not appropriate to go into a meal train visitevent with any expectation you will leave with anything a host may offer if they have too much or things will spoil too quickly but the expectation is rude and inappropriate the point is to gift them food they asked for your company as well but the pointagreementexpectation is still to gift them food,MLeek
its been six months its time for a checkin,MLeek
ask him how the saving towards buying into your house is going we all know the answer is its not,MLeek
tell him youre not comfortable moving forward with him if he doesnt provide more clarity about his debt situation and repayment plan because you shouldnt be,MLeek
stop tiptoeing around his stress ego and tell him plainly what you need from an adult partner,MLeek
he needs to be stressed and pressured that is what he should be feeling right now hes misled his partner about his finances having stressful conversation full of pressure is how you succeed at a life partnership if he crumbles under this pressure and cannot at least make a focused efforted to keep his word to you about money then you absolutely cannot have children with him,MLeek
you need to stop thinking of yourself as a provider and start thinking of yourself as a partner and a partner doesnt say oh whatever you thinkneedwant im sure itll work out when they are in fact not at all sure of that a partner speaks up clearly about their own needs and limits and concerns a partner isnt such a damn pushover,MLeek
im not surprised you feel like a pawn right now you have accepted that role you are following that script,MLeek
while she may be inconsiderate or poor at budgeting or have any other set of negative qualities shes not here right now youre here asking this questions and reading these answers right now nothing she intiates is going to save you from the selfimposed consequences of your own choice to not speak up clearly about your preferences and needs and feelings,MLeek
you need to be confident enough in yourself and have enough faith in your marriage to say what you actually think in each of the cases above you told her to make her own choice and then resented her for doing so,MLeek
moreover if she is the one taking on the work of planning all of these trips you actually may need to step in with far more concrete plans if there is something you want to be prioritized i could be wrong but the  if you can find a free weekend response sounds to me like it might have been a you do the work dont make me plan yet another thing stepping up and taking on a larger share of that mental labour and planning for family or couple trips might be a good way to address both of your feelings of being left out or neglected and to start approaching this subject as a team with a shared plan instead of all trips being primarily her projects,MLeek
its not that strange this is just you being attracted to the people you see as peers and it takes experience to properly identify your peers most teenagers cannot know what they do not know which is the whole reason some laws apply to them the laws are a bit arbitrary  but society has to pick a line so the line gets picked and we organize ourselves and societies permissions and expectations of young people around it,MLeek
but seriously dont date a 30yearold its healthy enough for you to see them as a peer but that is a lack of experience on your side still there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with a 30yearold who sees you as a peer no matter how wonderful and mature you are,MLeek
you need legal advice this isnt a relationship issue anymore,MLeek
dont contact him not yourself not personally not ever,MLeek
as i said not a relationship issue you have no relationship whatsoever with this person anymore you are not consenting to any relationship or contact any contact you have no should go through the lawyers or law enforcement or at the most a professional message in your capacity as a professional offering to purchase the domain at a reasonable rate but not offering to sell your friendship or any personal contact whatsoever,MLeek
reach out to a nonprofit that supports abuse or stalking victims access some legal advice,MLeek
or more pointedly dont worry about it too much and build your site with the same kind of accessible variation of your name that most people named john smith need to figure out link it in all your bios correctly and googleseo will quickly figure it out and send people looking for your full name to the site that is actually populated with content,MLeek
so that is the exact problem im advising you to address,MLeek
you need to have a conversation one where you try to understand her perspective and not one where you try to make her perform to your expectations seeing it from her perspective involves listening and understanding her choices you dont seem to have managed that on your own so have that conversation with a professional involved that is the only thing which will tell if youre are still compatible or not,MLeek
shes a person first and you are actually working really hard to not have to see it from perspective there is nothing here in this question that says you have heard or understood her perspective you simply report her actions if you saw it from her perspective youd be willing to talk about her goals and concerns about stopping her education or her work youre treating her goals and values as if they are just bad habits she needs to break taking a class isnt stuck in your ways its not a bad habit being uncomfortable or unwilling to be a sahm is not a bad habit its a huge leap of trust to put in the working partner,MLeek
i feel for you you are working really hard but youre not working smart when it comes to your relationship there are obviously major issues in how the housework and childcare is divided but youve taken such an extreme and closeminded view of it im not shocked you two cannot even communicate about it anymore,MLeek
if you decide she is nothing except the mother of your daughter and that her employment and school work are just bad habits shes stuck in then shes not your human partner any longer your relationship will and should end if that is your attitude towards her and you will be solely coparents,MLeek
look even if he had any reasonable discomfort talking about his partner he actively hid inappropriate conversations with another woman and even looped his parents into the situation gross,MLeek
you know he was full of shit and weaponizing your mental illness against you try not to stew on it there is nothing to learn here except to end things sooner and that is a lesson only experience can teach you,MLeek
i would back way up and get both of your butts into couples counselling,MLeek
and individual counselling for yourself this is not all about what you can do for them  you need and deserve support which they are probably not wellequipped to offer at the moment please make sure you get it,MLeek
you need a counsellor who is experienced with queernonbinary patients and respects ethical nonmonogamy but put a big old pause on actually practicing any openness or nonmonogamy coming out one week having a crush and pursuing an open marriage the next is not a healthy timeline for anyone involved here not them not you not anyone else unlucky enough to fall into to either of you in this bumbling sorta openness youre considering,MLeek
the best way to support them is to be healthy yourself and to sort out your own needs and goals some selfishness on your part isnt an attack its an important next step towards a relationship that genuinely serves you both in the way you each need,MLeek
take some space apart if you can get tested and ask for his records,MLeek
gather the information you can but recognize the information you already have is pretty damning your husband decided to be ignorant about this to make his own life less embarrassing even if it meant putting you at risk its a deadly serious breach of trust,MLeek
an sti is not a bodily function its a transmittable illness,MLeek
he chooses to believe untrue things about a transmittable infection he had before they become sexually active and throughout the marriage  that could be easily disproven by a google search or transparent conversation with a doctor because the false information he had found was convenient to him,MLeek
he exposed her to increase cancer risk with her knowledge,MLeek
that is nothing like lying and saying it was the dog who farted,MLeek
thats like exposing someone to an increased cancer risk and genital warts without their knowledge for years,MLeek
its been seven years,MLeek
are you gonna spend the rest of your lives together refusing to accept and trust your partner to select his own friends,MLeek
you can always leave someone whose boundaries and morals you dont respect but you choose to stay and have continued with that choice stop pretending to yourself hes gonna turn into someone else,MLeek
hes picking these people and hes gonna go on picking these people make peace or gtfo,MLeek
it seems you two didnt have a solid agreement on child care and finances prior to the baby arriving,MLeek
you made offers to her that you thought were generous and proper but offers are different from mutual agreements youre both very much adults you need to have conversations and make agreements,MLeek
you had very traditional expectationshopes of her and shes clearly noped the hell right outta that you cannot force her to perform the way you want her to she has to agree to it she has to want that or at least accept it and feel secure as an adult who is dependent on you in order to stop working or delay her education goals if she isnt willing to do that you cannot force her you can just choose not to be her partner,MLeek
you might not be compatible as partners but stuck with one another as coparents,MLeek
couples counselling would be wise you two skipped over some important conversations about the division of labour and finances and you need to have them now you dont seem to have any understanding here of what is motivating her to work or to get an education you dont have to agree with her or even like her choices  she can be an outright terrible human being for all i know  but youre stuck with her so itll help you to understand what she is thinking so you can have a real conversation,MLeek
sounds like you are probably fundamentally incompatible and that there is also a huge lack of trust here once you realize your life would be easier as a single parent thats generally the direction it heads in but even still a couples counsellor can help you navigate the split,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
the point of love languages isnt just to get someone else to speak yours its to pay attention and understand them when they speak,MLeek
my boyfriend doesnt speak words of affirmation very much but he knows they are important to me and he tries,MLeek
what he does do is tidy my kitchen and pick up my grocery list meticulously every time hes over he,MLeek
if youre not happy leave the relationship respectfully and honestly but dont forget that love languages are also about listening not just demanding your preferences be met,MLeek
your husband lied to you,MLeek
for six years,MLeek
the first thing you do is go get tested vaccines are almost never 100 percent and gardasil protects against nine of the common human papillomavirus hpv types there are more than 150 types while the odds might be good that he has one of the more common types that the vaccine may cover your husband was wrong and monstrously selfish to assume the type he had was one the vaccine covered he has absolutely no way of knowing what type i very very much doubt he spoke to a doctor who gave him the advice that you were fine and it was aokay to lie to you they almost certainly said your wife needs regular screenings,MLeek
you are utterly justified in requesting any evidence you wish but you might need to have more fundamental think even in the bestcase situation  where he didnt cheat had this from the beginning and assumed you were immune  is this okay is that really all that much better he chose to keep himself and you ignorant of the reality of the situation and the risk for a decade because he rather protect his ego than your health,MLeek
i sincerely hope no one in your life is ever in need of support regarding abuse this is a truly heartbreakingly horrible take on reactive abuse,MLeek
mutual abuse is rather rare the actual power and control dynamics rarely permit it reactive abuse is almost always present in any abusive relationship this is textbook reactive behaviour from op after facing years of manipulation and blameshifting,MLeek
reactive abuse is pretty basic and can exist in any abusive relationship between people parents and children friends and even employees and bosses,MLeek
you think youve got some special insight because youre being contrary but its just ignorantly sticking to a narrative that is as old as time itself,MLeek
a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup,MLeek
youre already on that path you may care for her on some level but you dont respect her behaviour or decisions or even trust her intentions thats not fair to either of you you shouldnt be trying to force yourself into a relationship with someone you have those feelings about,MLeek
be honest enough to admit to her that you dont want a break you dont want to be in this at all break up,MLeek
youre 36 you owe it to any woman you date seriously to have this shit figured out better than this i expect this kind of dithering from a man a decade younger than you no one here is going to have the exact answer for you except to tell you that yes its high time you put in the work and figure this out,MLeek
speak to a therapist if you need to sort out your own thoughts and come to conclusions you can live with for yourself its no longer reasonable or fair to put this all on finding the perfect partner and a rational person should probably realize that if youre unwilling to sacrifice everything to make it possible then its probably not going to happen because for most people having kids does means sacrificing a hell of a lot,MLeek
ignoring for a moment that having a much older biological father actually does impact the outcomes for the infant in some ways because more importantly unless you are independently wealthy time does run out in a practical sense youll probably want to retire not still be paying for school trips or tuition into your 60s,MLeek
dont engage with this person they are not interested in your safety they are interested in attacking you on the basis of your gender,MLeek
there will be time to reflect on how you can make better choices right now the choice you need to make is to prioritize your safety above all else,MLeek
the moment anyone punches or throws anything the other person is at serious risk of harm,MLeek
so the relationship is over,MLeek
no one has to behave perfectly  not women men or children  to deserve not to be abused,MLeek
emotional manipulation deserves a breakup not a screaming match not a hole in the wall not the real threat of escalating physical violence,MLeek
what is deeply sexist here is the idea that men are not capable of facing big difficult feelings without resorting to violence they are men are sensible and capable of dealing with big feelings and even break ups without being abusive without screaming bloody murder or making inane accusations and transparent attempts at guilt tripping without punching walls or people most of them pull it off just fine,MLeek
men can be capable of dealing with these moments without violence when they and others expect it of themselves,MLeek
hopefully at some point you will stop thinking there is anything people do that means they deserve to be abused,MLeek
edit and yes men are even capable of leaving emotionally abusive partners without violence,MLeek
its insane to think this is apology territory this is escape plan territory,MLeek
he is not sweet sweet is the mask he wears when he knows a sensible person would leave his abusive ass,MLeek
your bfs emotional and verbal abuse has escalated to the first steps of physical abuse people who will hit objects to scare and intimate you are warming up to hit you,MLeek
it may not happen tomorrow but this man has been telling you over and over again that he is willing to hurt you to keep getting what he wants,MLeek
dont ask for an apology plan the breakup and then execute it quickly the most dangerous moment for a person leaving an abusive partner is when the abuser realizes they are losing control that is why the violence escalated when you told him it wasnt working,MLeek
look up the cycle of abuse and then plan your exit from this dangerous situation,MLeek
did you read my last paragraph dude where i spelled out that you should expect and ask for the same and advocate for yourself cause it sounds like youre retreating into resentment instead of doing the work to communicate your own valid needs,MLeek
if you rather have your martyrdom thats what youll get,MLeek
sure bro and for decades we thought women couldnt have autism at all  because they werent disruptive enough,MLeek
its almost like there is just way way more pressure on women to mask and perform whereas men get to indulge in their eccentric genius myth,MLeek
its the main thing going on in her head right now,MLeek
your response wasnt just unsupportive it was cruel,MLeek
a complete no exam talk rule is telling her that she has nothing to contribute at all at the moment and you expect constant performance of good girlfriend and good girlfriends arent allowed to be stressed out,MLeek
instead create exam free zones or times over meals while youre in bed together make space for other another separate from her exams,MLeek
if youre feel silenced about your own stress or exams use the same guidelines learn to ask for what you want as she is now not punishing her for not automatically have given it to you in the past,MLeek
people are gonna pile on you telling you not to take is so personally  and while that isnt wrong  it doesnt mean his behaviour is kind or considerate,MLeek
you dont have to want to be the one who is constantly ignoring or managing someone elses every passing negative feelings or be doing all the work to redirect your partners inconsiderate bids for attention they need to do the bulk of that work themselves those are their feelings primarily their job its okay to ask for more kindness and consideration in how youre spoken to in those moments,MLeek
hes a grownup he should be able to manage his disappointment better than that at a tiny little totally predictable and justifiable hiccup where he doesnt not immediately receive what he wants,MLeek
it is reasonable for you to be disappointed in him for his lack of that emotional regulation skill and not showing you more consideration,MLeek
youre not controlling his emotions by being disappointed in how he is managing or not managing them youre telling him that there are times like when you are in the middle of work when you expect him to moderate his behaviour and handle his emotions himself not dropping them at your feet like a dead mouse like a cat and getting pissy youre not proud of him for expressing himself,MLeek
you would probably do better not to his feelings on yourself so readily  but i dont think the problem here is an equal one or a just a misunderstanding  hes not being considerate to respond with anything besides okay hun love ya talk later,MLeek
oh i have so many strategies for beingappearing busy,MLeek
but i hadnt thought of have you seen soandso since they were back from vacay i think they were asking after you a few strategically placed comments like that might stop the be friendlier vibes im getting,MLeek
strange i thought biologically we both basically based on 50 of our genes,MLeek
its almost like a sense of entitlement and refusal to be a full participant in childrearing isnt rooted in genetics,MLeek
well if he is then he apparently knows you well enough to know itll work,MLeek
why is this taking up any space at all in your brain,MLeek
why are you trying to read your exboyfriends mind,MLeek
youre newly married ya really got nothing better to do,MLeek
its a date if he wanted a professional connection he has linked in or could track down your work email,MLeek
you matched on a dating app its a date,MLeek
hes only sure there is nothing she can do about it once the way the baby is there not for a few years,MLeek
once heard a guy at work just straight up admit he say it that way she cant leave me while shes on mat leave anyways and then shell be too busy so im probably good until they are in first grade at least,MLeek
youre overthinking and these assumptions arent gonna help you any,MLeek
ask the dude out yourself,MLeek
i realize this isnt the best advice but youre describing almost exactly what ended my longterm relationship,MLeek
my ex didnt want to make the changes necessary to be a parent himself he assumed id do the work more than what i was already doing he wanted kids like he wanted a steam achievement or a trophy from the local beer pong league he wanted to cuddle them while they peacefully slept not take the day off work when they were ill show up at championship games but not to have to figure out the carpool schedule for the weekly practices he just knew his life wouldnt change much because surely his job paid more so it would be more important he shrugged off the changes he was insisting i make to mine,MLeek
women get shit on for going babycrazy but i know far more of this type of guy to go legacycrazy they dont want to parent they want to check the i passed on my genes box dont be a vessel for his ambitions if he wants to be a parent he needs to be a partner first and address your perfectly reasonable concerns and standards,MLeek
you cannot make her feel something,MLeek
its not about you,MLeek
shes been clear she doesnt like it dont pester stop pretending there is some magic spell you need to recite she doesnt like it,MLeek
frankly i dont send photos either by enjoy receiving them there i just dont feel safe and confident sending anyone any nudes at all ever i appreciate that other people are comfortable with this but im not and im not going to do it it doesnt feel good its not exciting or fun a guy who behaved like you are and created all the pressure on us both trying to earn my comfort would be extremely annoying and not someone id want to date,MLeek
you could be the most trustworthy human being who ever lived and im still not going to do something i dont want to do she shouldnt either,MLeek
if you dont enjoy leaving your comfort zone for her then stop doing it,MLeek
you only had a foundation of five months this was the likeliest outcome of a sudden separation and she was clear with you she is overwhelmed and needs to focus on her deployment,MLeek
it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it means this situation was not conducive to a stable and healthy connection continuing to grow,MLeek
cry it out eat some sugar or some carbs dont beat yourself up that an objectively tough situation in a very young relationship didnt pull through for you,MLeek
most people not just women want to feel desired,MLeek
its not about being a douchebag or being rude its about being expressive and transparent that youre into her sexually,MLeek
the relationship might be doomed you might be incompatible,MLeek
regardless youre far too old not to realize that very few people  men or women  enjoy sex with doormats we pretty much all want to feel our partner has got a full rich life they want to share time and energy with us not that they are desperately clinging to us and have nothing going on besides the relationship to which they give all thier time and engery we pretty much all want to feel our partner really wants us and is excited by us and isnt so terrified of rejection or offence that they wont express that,MLeek
this is abusive behaviour consistently baseless accusations of cheating are a tactic to keep you trying to prove yourself and service his needs hes set up a sisyphean task  itll take all your energy to defend yourself and you never actually will,MLeek
it may be time to tell him that you refuse to be played like that,MLeek
youre willing to work through his anxieties with him but not for him if he keeps trying to make this your job to solve a problem that exists solely in his head the marriage is going to end maybe not tomorrow but sooner or later you cannot maintain a marriage where you are treated this way,MLeek
ask him to see a doctortherapist on his own its a sudden change and he needs an assessment to make sure these fearsfeelings are rooted in a physical or medical issue do not agree to couples counselling unless he is willing to speak to someone himself first and he is willing to be accountable for his behaviour if he doesnt do those two things is is very likely he will just use what he learns in couples counselling to refine his tactics of abuse,MLeek
and its probably time to have an emergency plan know where your important documents are and know where you are going if you need to leave quickly you need to consider the possibility of real danger,MLeek
they are probably not legally married because he is on record as believing the government ruined marriage with things like nofault divorce,MLeek
unpleasant as she might be its hard not to feel for a young woman having a child with a man who has gone on record as believing she is property and should have no legal right to leave him ever,MLeek
looking through your replies here i had given this guy way to much benefit of the doubt,MLeek
you are being lied and strung along hopefully that certainty makes it a bit easier cause sheesh this isnt even a case of not that into you this is a clear case of shitty person is  fucking with you stop letting them,MLeek
i dont think your wife has ever had a 10 dick or toy or a bruised cervix,MLeek
very very very few people actually want 10 inches of insertable length seriously,MLeek
play stupid games win stupid prizes,MLeek
this was a stupid joke that you started get a grip and let it go,MLeek
do we need to insult her appearance she doesnt look 35 and rationally we know shes not and shes not behaving online as if shes much above 17,MLeek
she can be a deeply unpleasant person or even a bigoted and hateful person and still be in a relationship with a seriously problematic power dynamic with a man who appears to be nearly 10 years older than she is and openly discusses her and now his unborn daughter as property,MLeek
shes already the second wife,MLeek
its part of his origin story his first wife was seven years older than him and apparently started cheating and doing sex work two years into their marriage,MLeek
maybe the first wife was abusive maybe hes full of shit well never know but perhaps recognizing how the age gap impacted his first marriage he goes out and finds himself someone about a decade younger than him to toe the line,MLeek
he doesnt have to be a narcissist to be doing you real harm,MLeek
and no obviously you should not let him come crawling back,MLeek
and its not ghosting if you tell him what is happening so tell him youre gonna sort out the leave then as soon as youre not legally bound to him you will be blocking him and never want to speak to him again,MLeek
call a tenants rights organization in your area and then the leasing office the quicker you move to invalidate the lease the more options youll have tell them this strategic truth your exbf was misleading you and its no longer safe for you to move in with him,MLeek
all of his exes are crazy all his exes will aways be crazy he makes sure to drive them crazy get rid of him for good,MLeek
the baby is still in utero and hes posting about how she wont be allowed to leave the home until she is married or go to college because college is for skankroos,MLeek
first lady of the manosphere one might assume,MLeek
before or after ones eyes roll right out of ones head,MLeek
not having the papers isnt unusual,MLeek
coming up with several different versions of the story for not having them is and a young man spending several days without his phone in a hospital after a fall where he only has a bruise to show for it that does strain credulity,MLeek
dont call his bluff dont play detective this person has barely been in your life a few months and youve found them unreliable dishonest and only reaching out to you when he needs validation or assistance,MLeek
just end it cleanly,MLeek
act like nothing happened because nothing has changed,MLeek
its not like hes gonna tell your mom that hes a serial cheater,MLeek
youre both showing up for the meal because youre young people respecting your mother as host thats it just do that,MLeek
you dont have to be terribly smart to be an effective manipulator toddlers are effective,MLeek
we really just cannot know the legal ramifications in a case like this the parents may not have been legally entitled to visitation or the care team could have advised against it,MLeek
does it look bad from the outside hell yeah am i gonna damn the parents no they struggled for nearly a decade with a seriously ill and complex child needing to surrender a dangerously mentally ill family member to the state is a devastating decision a child even more so whatever they did wrong there is no question they have suffered,MLeek
op needs to make the best choices for his own health but hating these people isnt productive from a bunch of online randos,MLeek
what are you doing to manage your anxiety,MLeek
because while i think your mother is being unkind and silly not to just let you be responsible for your own laundry this is not really a rational riskmanagement strategy,MLeek
and when anxiety crops up in this sort of way its usually pretty damn prevalent in a bunch of other ways too,MLeek
or even just indigestion,MLeek
you ate too many spicy wings and are feeling pretty uncomfortable burpy or gassy or something well lets just put you in a possibly uncomfortable position and ram my body inside of you repeatedly or maybe a lot of bouncing yeah you could do all the bouncing instead what but why not,MLeek
it would be unkind to ask,MLeek
its perfectly acceptable to say no its just not working for you,MLeek
dont worry about if youre enabling them or not just stand up for yourself this constant shortterm loaning is exhausting and uncomfortable you dont want to do it anymore,MLeek
if she wants to let you know what is going on she can confide in your or not but either way youre not a cheap payday loan officer so quit that job,MLeek
are you in a relationship or a hostage situation,MLeek
hes basically holding a gun to the head of the relationship and demanding you fuck him or hell shoot it dead,MLeek
but its already dead tell him he is right youre not compatible youre an adult who is capable of compassion and nonsexual affection as well as sexual affection and hes just not,MLeek
this relationship is over,MLeek
it doesnt matter how right you are if you continue to attempt to punish her with demands of payment the relationship is over and youll never see the money,MLeek
its not about who has the right its about the actual reality so just face it,MLeek
consider 800 an expensive lesson that this is not the person you want to move forward with as an adult partner with more and more serious obligations and expenses continued grievances about the debt are only going to hurt you more not make you any wealthier,MLeek
your ex is an abuser and a manipulator,MLeek
i honestly wouldnt believe a word he says about his dad im sure his dad is hearing all sorts of crazy untrue stories about you,MLeek
the facts we know are that your 30yearold bf went from mooching off his dad to mooching off you to mooching off his dad again maybe as a super cheap babysitter,MLeek
wise up this man is already ruining your life slowly its not gonna get any better youll never appease him he wants to abuse you nothing you send him will ever convince him to stop doing the thing he wants to do it can only get worse keep records and be prepared to get the police involved if needed but end all contact with your abusive ex,MLeek
i think bringing this question into a group session with people who know you a bit better and have at least a bit more similar experiences is a great idea,MLeek
in the end your therapist is right this really is about what you want to do connecting with your family will be hard work in a lot of ways you dont have to do that work,MLeek
at a glance it seems your family recognizes that and is open to having as much or as little interaction as youd like,MLeek
this really is about whether or not you want to have any kind of personal relationship with them most people are gonna suggest that its probably worth the work to try to connect with them at least a bit because even just a very few personal relationships are pretty really important to human happiness however this just isnt a question anyone else can answer for you in the end this decision belongs completely to you and that does make it tough especially if youve spent a long time institutionalized and under care you may not have a lot of experience with big choices that belong entirely to you and this one really does,MLeek
you do nothing you continue to come when invited and be friendly and civil,MLeek
your gf handles her mother and establishes the expectations with her for how you are treated,MLeek
you dont get to make someone like you your gf gets to tell her mother what the consequences will be for their relationship if her mother isnt civil to you,MLeek
you did something childish and stupid,MLeek
but why would you even want to date someone who sincerely believes they need to protect their family from you,MLeek
thats clearly not a situation either of you should continue in at all,MLeek
you need to just stop every sort of interaction with this person except his legal form obligations to you and the child as a coparent,MLeek
you and your mom should talk to a family lawyer and do not allow him into any medical appointments unless his presence makes you feel safer and more secure childbirth even at it easiest and smoothest is terrifying,MLeek
regardless of any mistake you ever made do not allow anyone in the room when youre giving birth unless that person adds to your happiness and feeling of safety please please know you can be 1000 selfish at that moment you do not owe him that that moment unless he can be trusted to behave himself  and right now he cannot he is not behaving like a coparent or someone who respects you as a the mother of his child,MLeek
you made mistakes when you were a teenager in a relationship you were also preyed on by an abuser who greatly benefited from your inexperience and immaturity to get what he wanted nothing you did means hes off the hook for his cruelty or any abuse he commited,MLeek
dont rob your child because you feel guilty about being a shitty 18yearold girlfriend forget about being a girlfriend never be his girlfriend again focus on being a parent yourself and giving your child the best start you can that means clarifying his rights and responsibilities under the law to protect your child and provide what you can for them,MLeek
technically true and patently ridiculous are not mutually exclusive,MLeek
lets not keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out,MLeek
ive always thought anyone who wants to control and abuse will use the narratives available to them to do so those people who are seeking to control can twist leftleaning narratives and language even more deceptively than fundamental faith based ones  a lot of us catch wise to those one faster these day in my 30s i actually stepped back from some guys i was friends with because i realized they were using me to virtue signal their progressiveness to dates and gfs while actually behaving in ways that were extremely conservative heteronormative andor straight up toxic in their private lives,MLeek
my feelings have always been these sorts are going to get what they want and the politics are always a mask no matte what the politics are,MLeek
but the most truly feminist men ive dated are probably the ones who talk the least about it listen the most and just focus on living their own lives aware of bias and attempting to treat women equitably,MLeek
you can say no,MLeek
and it sounds like you should you dont actually trust him to behave reasonably or respectfully and even if you did i dont want too is a totally good enough reason to say no i just dont want that i am comfortable with the current level of contact and not ready to be friends,MLeek
no contact after a break up really should mean several months not two weeks unless there are things like leases and pets to sort out,MLeek
youre not responsible for managing his insecurities for him or keeping him from feeling any pain its normal and natural for you to be happier now  thats why you broke up its okay for him to be hurt by that but its not your job to lie to him its his job to accept reality,MLeek
closure is a myth its not something you have in your purse and need to hand over to him its a thing he needs to sort out on his own,MLeek
its april i assume the semester is over soon tell him at least that you do not want more contact until after exams its not your job to address his shit right now focus on the important things you need to achieve right now,MLeek
she needs to plan to do this alone you cannot do it on her timeline you need a job there and she needs to accept that if her income cannot support you both at least for several months and moving with blow through your savings then this doesnt happen yet,MLeek
do not move cross our try with her on credit card debt and no job lined up that is insane shes not a sensible adult partner if she thinks that is the right path for either of you thats not some sacrifices thats madness,MLeek
imagine something totally different took place or that this woman behaved in a way i imagine she did but is in no way reflect here for the reasons i imagine she has oh also women who date online are desperate and sad and only doing it to further victimize the poor mens,MLeek
nah hard pass have a good one,MLeek
i think i have a chance with you so you get to be not like other girls until you disappoint me,MLeek
is that better or even much different is i think youre a hot girl and i think hot girls are insert negative generalization meaningful different than not like other girls i really dont think it is,MLeek
hes the one looking down on others in that moment specifically other girls he thinks are hot hes not talking about attractive men or egotistical people generally,MLeek
lets say youre absolutely right about his life experience this is still not a compliment and she doesnt have to be okay with this sort of awkwardness in the snippet we have here she does a great job of saying shes not cool with it without shaming or attacking him,MLeek
is there anyway she can say please dont shit on my gender in general that you would deem acceptable,MLeek
he might have never met a black person with a phd but if he said youre not like other black people wed all know that aint a compliment and it aint okay,MLeek
yes how dare i choose not to continue in the company of a person who has a negative set of opinions about a group i belong too,MLeek
why would i possibly assume that someone who openly exposes negative biases and opinions about other girls might not actually think all that highly of me or may swiftly change their mind,MLeek
why dont i take a chance on someone who expresses generalized dislike for people of my gender its probably just them being clumsy with words no way they could possibly have realized or intended to be joining in the relentless stream of lowkey misogyny of daily life,MLeek
i see now that my standards are absurdly high how dare i hold the people around me to the standard of not expressing casual contempt for people like me,MLeek
s,MLeek
its not a compliment just because it makes the person saying it feel good about themselves thats actually usually a pretty good sign that its not a kind thing to say it all,MLeek
not only are you entitled to talk about sex and the situation regarding sex in this relationship you have too if it is triggering for them and they cannot speak with you then respectfully acknowledge that isnt the kind of relationship you want to be in its not fair to either of you and there is nothing wrong with you being clear that you want a relationship that includes mutual sexual desire andor open communication about sex,MLeek
it makes sense to be stewing over it right now days after the break up but it doesnt change my advice,MLeek
this is over let it be over dont give in to his halfasses promises of change accept the unknowable,MLeek
the reality is you will probably never know for sure and the sooner you make peace with that the sooner youll be able to move past it,MLeek
the odds of him actually going to a single therapy appointment are slim you know that he was just saying what he needed to try and renegotiate the break up,MLeek
dont get back with a guy youve always had concerns about and who behaved this way just let it be over,MLeek
lots of women have internalized misogyny its best not to take it too personally,MLeek
you know he was taking a dig at you it doesnt mean hes unbalanced but it does mean hes a condescending little shit,MLeek
your initial instinct was correct be less sorry to be rejected by this sort recognize your mothers limitations as a source of advice as well on what behaviour to accept from men,MLeek
deliberately getting black out drunk as a goal is a problem regardless of the circumstances,MLeek
you should be far more concerned about her ability to stay safe from randos or uber drives then about her past hookup if she is set out to purposely incapacitate herself in public,MLeek
i liked to club to relieve stress when i was her age but never purposefully got so drunk i couldnt remember or blacked out that was never the goal of the evening and personally i never found it that hard to not fuck around on my partner when i was in a relationship its just not that hard to not cheat,MLeek
im a combination of the all girls ive seen and admired in some way is a rather lovely way to put it id hope we all are a combination of what we admire in others regardless of gender although i know took me till i was a bit older to realize what i had modelled after the positive men in my life as well,MLeek
youre rolling those dice no matter who you have a child with,MLeek
you could both be phd astrophysicists and end up with a child who is bored by or struggles in school,MLeek
what is far more important is that you two have some agreement about the importance of education and how you will support your children if they do struggle,MLeek
the ability to be successful in school is a nice to have a partner who is actually your loving supportive and respectful partner is a must have,MLeek
nah that was a solid reply and refusal to continue down that path with her,MLeek
id recommend you block her everywhere,MLeek
if she wants her buttons pushed shell do that all on her own no matter what you say so you if dont want further contact enforce it to the best of your ability,MLeek
why wont women work in jobs where they are particularly unwelcome and subject to above average abuse and contempt  when they can even get hired to begin with i boggles the mind,MLeek
wha i dont want people assaulted at trump rallies either,MLeek
is this nutter talking about ashley babbitt cause that is just a extra plus bad terrible take,MLeek
its almost like the predators dont wear little warning bells around their necks,MLeek
youre not like other girls has become a straight up warning alarm for me it tells me you cannot maintain basic social ties or have friendly conversation with women you dont want to have sex with it,MLeek
its not a compliment its a concerning reflection on your character dude,MLeek
sounds like its actually the preference,MLeek
eh sounds like thats the actual problem here,MLeek
if you distrust him this much figuring out whenif his dad called him about the accident is rather besides the point isnt it,MLeek
i hope youre working with a counsellor theyll probably necessary at this point and can help you address the core issue here figuring out this phone call is not the core issue its the place the drama llama is taking a shit today,MLeek
are you in the process of divorcing or not its unclear you filed months ago but still call him your so,MLeek
if you are i think you need to consider this purely from the position of coparent not spouse as a coparent what contact if any will you have with the kids grandparents and unclesaunts or do you expect all of that contact and information to flow through their father to you,MLeek
if you want to continue to have a relationship with your exinlaws then yes you should absolutely ask after their health but not quiz them in their contact with your ex so,MLeek
im not offended at all advice is about perspective and im a okay that mine isnt of value to you ive honestly wished you good luck and youve kept on assuming the worst of everything i type you think maybe youre a bit needlessly combative sometimes and unable to accept another persons perspective or feelings as valid youre only options here for your partner is that hes an idiot or a liar,MLeek
just not how id want to move through the world and thats truly okay by me its just a advice,MLeek
yes youre 25 this is a thing to discuss openly,MLeek
just remember that opinions and situations can change its not a contract its an ongoing conversation in a relationship you should expect people to try to be honest with you about what they do know about themselves but not to know everything and not to be able to promise you exactly what sex will be like between now and 2065,MLeek
i didnt say you should break up,MLeek
i said i cannot imagine bringing such a demeaning and combative attitude into an important conversation with the person ive committed too everyone has flaws but i would never frame my partners this way or assume they had nothing of value in their own perspective or choices on a subject doing so would make me miserable,MLeek
good luck,MLeek
and youre not gonna leave him after describing him that way sesh okay i cannot imagine committing to someone in my 30s if we both agreed they were fundamentally objectively childish and just having to work around that,MLeek
i didnt suggest behaving like a teacher but communicating openly as if two adults are involved with some appreciation for differences in knowledge and values but hey if you both know this is what works good luck,MLeek
yeah shitty turn of phrase i can see how that was hurtful im sorry,MLeek
see she how fucking easy that is,MLeek
it was more important to your husband that he got to blame you for ruining the morning than it was for him to 5 seconds of emotional reflection and just say yeah ok i can do better,MLeek
our language is full of phrases and idioms that are hurtful and biased and bigotted no one is gonna avoid them perfectly but dear god its not that hard to take a beat and think thats not so hot really,MLeek
also how much dusting and vacuuming does this asshat do i might hazard a guess,MLeek
yes they can it can be wildly variable people are complicated,MLeek
some people dont experience much sexual arousal at all both men and women can be on the extremes of really higharousal or very low women are often shamed and judged for high and men are usually shamed and judged for low but we all exist on a wide spectrum and a spectrum that can even shift throughout our lives,MLeek
a lot of women especially young women are not encouraged to understand their own sexual arousal or ever express it openly sometimes they simply dont know how because there arent many healthy models for it but it can also be shameful or even unspokenly dangerous for them to try,MLeek
you were both young you dont need to be quizzing women or trying to read your exs mind thats not gonna help you need to be working on putting down the baggage you picked up from an early relationship that didnt work out well for either of you,MLeek
hoping hed figure it out andor expecting a better job at the age of 30 are still you describing situations that might be within his risk tolerance,MLeek
look i agree with you there is a real problem here in your position id be unhappy with my partner too but you need to stop approaching it with this insulting attitude that he is childish or evil he wasnt meeting your unspoken standards for financial security they werent his standards and he didnt have the information or the skills to know what yours were or how to meet them,MLeek
you should ask for what you need clearly but kindly with your ears open to his actual feelings and perspectives,MLeek
especially if there isnt a snowballs chance in hell of ending this relationship over this then put your damn fists down and set the worst of your judgements of his character aside begin from the place of him not being able to know what you dont tell him and you not knowing what his overall risk tolerance is in the longterm thatll be a way more productive conversation then trying to tell him he cannot afford to live like he saw his parents live,MLeek
i have understood that you are not interested in any advice or in adjusting of the thing you can control   your own behaviour  for the possibility of better outcomes while dating you want to date the majority of women apparently well also blaming all women apparently for a problematic system you are choosing to active reinforce and engage with,MLeek
okay thats fine by me thats how you want to play it then good luck with it,MLeek
is she cleaning up the children and dusting while also touching up her make up and taking 15 minutes to rest all magically before knowing whether or not hell come home late or not,MLeek
you can say pretty whatever you want and experience what you experience but you talked about studies and i think you took the wrong lesson from the data,MLeek
the lesson from the data is that consistently paying for all dates isnt as good or necessary strategy for men as they seem to believe it is to get to date the women who actually want to date them,MLeek
im glad you dont expect me to address your personal attacks so thinly veiled as genuine curiously but you gave my bf a good laugh so thank you,MLeek
the point i was making which could be actually quite useful was not about most women and certainly not most american women it is that if you assume all women are like x you are likely to only engage with women who confirm that belief youve set up a dynamic where you understand one anothers expectations you will be avoided or weeded out by women who are not like x or who very much dont want much of x in their lives if any so if you dont like x stop engaging in the behaviour that attracts and reinforces x fewer dates but better ones compatibility not high scoring,MLeek
you mean the studies that found women who scored higher in all three of the dark triad personality traits of narcissism psychopathy and machiavellianism were much more likely to engage in foodie calls and the women who scores lowest either didnt do it or felt they had done it said rarely and i would argue because of the guilt and social shame of accepting a meal from someone youre in the fence about,MLeek
i mean if were taking about the science men should absolutely stop trying to buy sex with meals perhaps pay for the first invitation they make and then switch to dutch rather quickly its not a particularly good strategy with any group of women anymore to pay for all dates thats what should be known widely  based on studies and surveys  but rejected by men who view dating more as a gamble as a numbers game instead of a compatibility search,MLeek
sounds like youre holding yourself to the traditional standard and then being annoyed that is resulting in more dates with women who accept those standards and performances youre indicating and initiating,MLeek
if a man in the early dating stage is taking all the initiative and has cast himself as pursuer i assume he wont be comfortable with me stepping up  and when i actually like him enough to try to correct this dynamic i often find i was right he couldnt hack with me if i wasnt a passive recipient,MLeek
if you were looking for actual compatibility instead of access youd probably have fewer dates but better ones,MLeek
i think the thing you really need to recognize and except is that he does feel secure with this,MLeek
he probably wasnt lying to you he probably wasnt withholding or keeping secrets this wasnt just technically good for him this is what financial stability looks like to him hes living just barely within his means and will i would agree with you that thats not really what stable is  for lots of people its the best they ever hope for,MLeek
youre in your 30s you own a home together while your current financial set up might have been working so far you need to see this as a big sign that you chew skipped over some really important conversations about longterm goals savings and retirement,MLeek
your gf seems to have unrealistic expectations,MLeek
your sister isnt her peer or her bestie she doesnt owe your girlfriend the attention and validation shes seeking,MLeek
does your gf frequently make vague break up threats when she doesnt get exactly what she wants,MLeek
he is being controlling dangerously extremely controlling,MLeek
hes also told you that he cannot control himself at all at parties or around pretty women he doesnt even really think he should have too its their fault if hes aroused by them,MLeek
break up and block him quickly it is unlikely the break up will stop his attacks completely you need to stay safe have zero contact,MLeek
you know he has an army of underpaid support staff predominantly woman who feed and cloth him care for his home and any children or pets and schedule his personal life for him,MLeek
which is why none of his employees can out work him while absolutely working harder every day than this price of shit human can even fathom,MLeek
watch out pearl shes way hotter and we know thats all that really matters,MLeek
you should have gotten rid of him after the rave,MLeek
disappointment is valid but this guy is just an asshole who cannot handle lifes hiccups without assigning blame and being a condescending shithead hopefully hell grow out of it but i wouldnt suggest sticking around and finding out,MLeek
i think being nervous of friendly men at 23 years old is totally normal youve probably met a lot of men who are willing and eager to take any opening they get,MLeek
but its not everyone as you age is a bit fewer people,MLeek
your boyfriend trusts you but you need to build your trust in yourself your own instincts and your own boundaries you got this you dont need to be second guessing yourself all the time you can be a human being and you can extend trust to men to be human beings  and you can revoke that trust in individual men as needed,MLeek
i wish theyd just do a better job of securing the provider type so id run into fewer of them,MLeek
its probably better that you not get too involved in the early stages even if it was your dialect youd want him to find his bearings through instructions before you got too involved,MLeek
i understand being disappointed this isnt something you can share but it also sounds like that wasnt a core goal of what he needs to achieve for his work that is sad but it also makes a lot of sense,MLeek
he also probably isnt aware of the depth of differences and the strong feelings between the two dialects my partner thought id be keen to use my french when we travel he had to see for himself a few times how my french was not always welcomed or understood by french people before he really started to get how different my dialect was from how most of the world speaks no matter how many times i told him he had to feel it before he believed it until then it was all just french to him,MLeek
that is childish and cruel,MLeek
if he has a problem with how your anxiety impacts his life he should discuss it with you like an adult and figure out what boundaries he needs to have or accommodations you need to make he can talk about that and figure it out,MLeek
if he cannot talk about it in that kind of reasonably way he is either too mean to date or too stupid,MLeek
he shouldnt be punishing you the way we do yappy little dogs or how shitty parents manage toddlers,MLeek
why did he do this,MLeek
were the classes easier to access,MLeek
is he choosing a dialect that is more commonly spoken or easier to learn,MLeek
when my partner wanted to learn french i actively steered him away from my dialect because the accent and diction are globally perceived as being cheap or not proper i actively encouraged him to learn metropolitanparsian french because we could still speak to one another just fine but hed get more use out of it in the rest of his life if it didnt stick to the way i spoke,MLeek
i can understand why you might have some feelings but i think youre being a bit unfair if hes choosing something that will be more broadly useful or accessible for him not to mention picking on someones accent or tone in the early learning stages is just decidedly unhelpful in my opinion,MLeek
this is the woman who once said  if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine,MLeek
i think its a bit foolish to imagine she does anything but run her mouth for attention,MLeek
there is no realizing of any kind going on shes white and wealthy she got hers she doesnt actually give a shit she just figured out a thing to tweet that would get the attention of both echo chambers,MLeek
dude ya do you have a problem with bi women you told us so listen to yourself,MLeek
when you say shit like is the way i feel justifiable by my morals and ethics what you are very clearly saying is you believe there is something inherently unethical or immoral about women who experience sexual attraction to other women as well as men,MLeek
you shouldnt date anyone you dont want to but youre being a naive asshole when you pretend your preferences are not rooted in stereotypes isms or phobias they often are hell a lot of our biases against smokers are i wouldnt date a smoker either but i acknowledge that some of the beliefs and attitudes i have about smokers are unfair and biased and its still not cool to compare sexual orientation to the choice to smoke or being an addict comparing being lgbtq to addiction or choice to smoke would be kinda homophobic,MLeek
you said things above that make it clear yours are rooted in biphobia and nasty assumptions about the character and values of bisexual people you said yourself that you perceived bisexual as less ethical and moral than heterosexuals like yourself,MLeek
we none of us are immune from the cultural messages that judge or demean others you seemed to be capable of recognizing this when it was directed at bisexual men dont pretend to be blind when you are the one directing these biases and judgements at bisexual women,MLeek
dont date bisexuals we cool please dont but also dont be shitty and pretend its just a preference you got some shit to unpack dont put it on other people or let yourself totally off on the hook none of us are perfect and you just said a bunch of shit that is biphobic accept it and youll be able to better avoid it,MLeek
edit sexual orientation not sexual irritation lol,MLeek
you are being irrational,MLeek
its biphobia when people assume girlongirl is just something fun for guys to watch and not real meaningful sex between two people who enjoy and care for one another its biphobia when men are shamed for secretly being gay or treated like they are gross and its also biphobia when you assume a bisexual isnt just as capable of monogamy and loyalty as any random heterosexual,MLeek
you are entitled to this bit of irrationality and shouldnt date anyone you dont want to,MLeek
its not anyone elses job to make you not biphobic youre not a monster but you are wrong and you absolutely need to stay away from bi people as dates its not kind or fair to them to make them address your irrationality or bias you should probably be thoughtful about how you treat any bisexuals or pansexuals you know socially you are experiencing a bias that is not true or kind,MLeek
there are plenty of men who feel as you do i get it a fair bit i appreciate it when they just keep that hateful bullshit to themselves and acknowledge they just are not keen to date a bisexual,MLeek
source a bisexual woman,MLeek
i think its more likely than youre imagining if its no big deal to this woman or her husband they might bring it up when they run into each other oh youre s wife yeah we dated years ago back in  such a small world that we both ended up raising our families here,MLeek
no matter how small the risk you think it is it exists i wouldnt roll those dice on my partner,MLeek
youre doing the right thing,MLeek
you may consider asking them to join you on a day trip instead of phrasing it as a gift to them ask them for their company as a gift to you and naturally as it is a thing you are planning and want to share with them you will pay a concert or play a trip to the beach especially something your cousins will enjoy instead of giving them a thing involve them in an experience with you,MLeek
dont try to force cash on them in the end you are barely an adult in their mind be gracious if they want to treat you like a young relative who is not yet expected to contribute money,MLeek
when you leave send them some photos and a long thank you note of your best memories that is clearly what they value from the visit,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
youre 30 youve been in couples counselling for ages she says shes not in love anymore you dont trust her when it comes to money and you cannot communicate about it,MLeek
of course you should find your own apartment youre just coasting downhill with a woman who seems unwilling to actually break up with you set yourself free,MLeek
its a small town gonna be way worse if she finds out in any other way besides you speaking up,MLeek
and thats why you should do it for her sake to spare her any risk of confusion or embarrassment by not knowing something that some else does thats the benefit to her,MLeek
it is also about you feeling better tell her that this is ancient history and i dont plan on seeking out her company but ive been thinking about it and i know if roles were reversed id be hurt by you not telling me so im telling you really just to manage my own feelings about it and my discomfort with keeping it a secret and so that you never get blindsided by someone else mentioning something to you,MLeek
you need to start saying no kindly but firmly,MLeek
thank you but no that isnt enough notice for me to comfortably get ready,MLeek
im sorry but no ive told you i require at least x number of hours notice to host people in my home and x hours before leaving the home id really appreciate you respecting my timlines so i can join you in the future,MLeek
boundaries dont control what they do a boundary is about how you are going to respond if they dont meet your needs or standard and what you are choosing for yourself once you state a boundary you have to choose it enforce it and often enforcing a boundary means you dont get what you most want either,MLeek
the only power you have here is to withdraw your participation if they value your company and presence in their lives they will adapt,MLeek
you can always leave a relationship you dont want to be in for any reason,MLeek
you havent been happy in this relationship for a rather long time it would be silly to continue,MLeek
you need to end contact there is nothing to gain by treating this like its an ongoing conversation its not its over,MLeek
have you been friends for years,MLeek
or have you been waiting for years thinking someday your friendship will earn you a date,MLeek
because its totally reasonable for her to be fearful of the latter,MLeek
dude you have zero interest in understanding why this is a bad take and not how consent or respect work a bunch of people have tried to explain peddle your willful ignorance elsewhere or create your own op for advice on how to human and what does consent mean,MLeek
yes consent is her view mutually enjoyable sex is her view if its not yours well nothing much else to say youre just kinda gross,MLeek
i really wish you were just an ignorant teenager but ive dated enough to know youre probably just a sad adult who cant get outta their own way,MLeek
no man that is the twisted part about of this whole thing the fact she did it before is why she knows she doesnt want too sex is supposed to be mutually enjoyable and consensual not a reward for boys its a not a gift she gave other men but if withholding now that is a pure toxic attitude,MLeek
shes not withholding hugs shes just not consenting to a sex act she knows well enough to know she doesnt want to perform again,MLeek
if a guy wrote mushy love letters before and didnt want to with me than id assume he didnt much enjoy writing them back then either and felt forced to perform,MLeek
break up with her if you need a relationship where oral sex is performed on you she is not offering you that kind of relationship,MLeek
stop talking about what she consented to in the past that part makes you the selfish piece of shit here and that is not justified just because she consented to something in the past doesnt mean she is required to continue consenting today she doesnt want to do it dont be the next in a line of assholes who bully and whine at her until she gives in,MLeek
be the honest guy who admits he really wants that in his relationship and breaks up to go find someone who is offering that kind of relationship,MLeek
i love her and would like to date her,MLeek
this is why,MLeek
she doesnt trust you to respond reasonably to her dating life she doesnt want your opinion she is aware it is biased she may also be trying not to hurt you with the information she reasonably assumes you dont want to hear about,MLeek
if she doesnt want this subject to be part of her friendship with you then you cannot force it what this means though is that you need to move on and not keep trying to win her over she is probably well aware she could date you if she wanted too she doesnt want too,MLeek
im not on my own today i think weve made the right decision for us both on balance  when i said it wasnt a problem i meant i was perfectly comfortable with the decision do you have a different idea of what would be best choice right now because i would hope if you did you would state it just as clearly as i just did and id believe you just like i need you to believe me when i speak,MLeek
the one i frequently use with my partner is if you were holding me back from something i felt strongly about youd absolutely hear about it,MLeek
you cannot fix this for him he needs a therapist to unpack and challenge what is in essence a toxic communication pattern but you should be clear with him that this behaviour is not respectful or kind and that youd like him to do better,MLeek
you know he overreacted but youre also kind of full of shit arent ya cause it isnt just curious when you hunt the smell down say yuck and are visibly disgusted those are actions those are actions that are reasonably insulting to another person,MLeek
this other person might also be an asshole but also you walked into someone elses home and insulted their cooking your behaviour was insulting and you lied about and minimized it when confronted instead of saying dude im sorry im sure its great for lot of people its just not for me,MLeek
lifes easier without a stick up your ass thats a bit of advice that might be useful for you as well as for him but since youre the one asking do a bit better dont be such a bullshitter if you fuck up just say you fucked up and move on,MLeek
be a grown up and express your boundaries,MLeek
you dont want to be friends its not an insult its doesnt mean she did something wrong there are lots of awesome people i dont want to be besties with,MLeek
you have no reason to fear abuse or harassment from her give her the courtesy and kindness of telling that while you think she is a lovely person there is just too much history and you arent comfortable maintaining contact or being her friend then block her without guilt,MLeek
you should explore types of therapy and different approaches its important o have some trust in that relationship,MLeek
digging into root causes is not actually the most effective form of therapy for a lot of struggles,MLeek
i personally prefer cbt which focuses on current behaviour and changing the thought patterns behind them,MLeek
if you want to talk about how your mother treated you when you were a toddler or about the meaning of your dreams you need a different kind of therapy,MLeek
why arent you listening to your therapist they have already explained this perfectly well,MLeek
if she wants a man like xyz she should go find him,MLeek
its okay to break up with her without first labelling her as the hypersensitive bad guy you can just stop the thing that isnt working without demonizing one another,MLeek
ive been wondering if the reveal of 50k fine for not making it to altar explains a bit more about why zackirina couldnt walk away when it clearly wasnt working and if the conversation in the bedroom where they break it off which was one of the few moments i had a tiny bit of respect for irina was only allowed to happen once the producers had agreed to let them off the hook,MLeek
there is a line between addressing your partners biases or limitations and being condescending as all hell you are in real danger of crossing it here,MLeek
it also seems likely that a lot of this is you externalizing your own emotional reactions and anxieties and assigning them to her character as if they were all her negative traits  when they really are more about your own bad mental habits and insecurities,MLeek
i think youd be very very wise to first consider how you can adapt your responses before putting it in writing that you think she is childish and unrealistic you seem to be very quick to interpret her passing comments as insults and take them deeply to heart that may not be fair or true to her experience or her meaning,MLeek
you may have a relationship issue as well but you absolutely have a stress management issue your anxiety about communicating your own needs and timelines seems to be the much larger issue here you should be looking for positive and constructive ways to communicate your own timelines needs and concerns about what the future looks like together to advocate for yourself in the relationship not reasons to call her a child or knock her down a few pegs or burst her bubble or make her be realistic but instead communicating openly about what you do want to work towards and when you think you can so youre both talking about reality sometimes and not just vague hopes or fantasies if you really think that of her then you have a much larger reconsideration to do,MLeek
sperate your questions for a bit,MLeek
is there something about your own behaviour youre not happy with feeling isolated from a tradition or norm isnt always a pleasant feeling but unless you are unhappy with your own choices that is a feeling that is entirely yours to manage as an adult  as you rightly realized no one should be restricting themselves so you dont feel left out they are in their own home not a kindergarten class,MLeek
feeling out of place is a you problem for you to navigate and manage and you are a bit out of place thats okay our families extend and can contain people who are very different from us sometimes it really is okay i am ludicrously out of place when i visit my family in rome its a bit awkward but a loving sort of awkward,MLeek
the second issue is about what you want to ask others for as a favour out of consideration for you the fact your daughter asked you initially about the pool makes me suspect that if you say hanging out naked over our morning coffee was just a tiny step too far for me would you mind wearing some clothing if were having a longer conversation,MLeek
it doesnt sound like you need boundaries or strict rules just to give your daughter a heads up that while you are fully respecting and supporting her choices in her own home as a guest with very different life experiences youre struggling with some things,MLeek
also didnt like cole at all he was attention seeking and instigating throughout he only got a pass because zanab was so awful hopefully hes grown,MLeek
i want to agree but micha is plenty old enough to see the consequences of the company she keeps and make better choices for herself the reformed mean girls i know had made the break by 26 hopefully the show was the kick in the ass she needed,MLeek
he only has these questions after she said she wasnt feeling it,MLeek
op came here to get the she should have disclosed pile on  even though he claimed to be accepting of her choice initially  and hes exactly the validation he came looking for and very little advice on how not get into this sort of pointless argument in the future with women who dont wish to date him,MLeek
you debated someone and insulted them when they were just trying to end the connection,MLeek
doesnt matter if you had a point that was a dumb and counterproductive thing to do that was only going to be mean and dramatic like i said before the correct response is thank you and good luck,MLeek
i told you how to improve in the future  with anyone not just a trans woman you dont seem that interested that part tho did you just come here to find people to tell you she did a bad bad thing by not disclosing why is it so hard to just not be compatible and leave it at that or to not clap back at someone who is telling you they arent interested,MLeek
no man based on your own story here you were mainly frustration was with being rejected you were willing to accept the situation  you thought it had been a good date  until she told you she wasnt feeling it,MLeek
the correct response to im not feeling the connection is thank you for letting me know good luck out there you dont ask why especially not if you cant handle the answer without arguing with them no matter what else nonsense they have to say you dont debate them you gtfo and be glad for it that is what you do next time you get told no by anyone,MLeek
you tried to knock her down a peg because you were disappointed and angry with the rejection you didnt think you deserved to be rejected for the reasons she gave but thats not how compatibility works youre not entitled to a certain number of chances or even to being properly understood a trans woman doesnt have to fall in love with you because you dont react with horror,MLeek
that the advice for next time when someone rejects you you say good luck not well actually let me explain to you the shitty things i think you did and why your rejection of me is wrong thats just pointless drama and ego defence,MLeek
that has nothing to do with her being trans thats just a really really stupid way to handle rejection,MLeek
this isnt complicated,MLeek
you werent compatible regardless of her being trans you were already not compatible she told you so given the differences in preferences and feelings about your conversation youd be reasonable to agree with her on that much,MLeek
while i would generally agree people should disclose prior to sexual intimacy  for their own safety more than anything  it really sounds a lot like you were more frustrated at being rejected than by anything else it really sounds like youre trying to make her the bad guy because she didnt want to see you again,MLeek
put your wounded ego aside stop getting twisted youre not compatible the rest is details take the l end of story,MLeek
relationships arent hostage situations,MLeek
most people understand this just fine,MLeek
block him and dont take his shit,MLeek
for anyone else just tell them he deserves to find someone who really wants to be with him it wouldnt have been right to waste his time and pretend to feel what you didnt,MLeek
or tell them he was manipulating and mean cause that is also true,MLeek
tell him that the healthy and adult way to deal with feelings is to communicate respectfully hes certainly allowed to feel hurt but this behaviour should be beneath him you made a request for your comfort and he seems to be responding with spite,MLeek
if he cannot manage better right now take a break and take yourself out for dinner,MLeek
you should block him this is rude this is unpleasant,MLeek
this is not enriching your life in any way,MLeek
youre allowed to nope outta something even if they arent actively harassing you,MLeek
why the only thing i could see changing my opinion here is why did he expect to be fired,MLeek
if he did something to risk his employment and kept that from you that may be a serious problem or present a major judgmentcharacter issue,MLeek
otherwise i wouldnt get my knickers in a knot about a day people dont always make good choices when they are panicking,MLeek
you had even less power than he did for those 48 hours all his choice did was rob him of your support during a tough day,MLeek
it is a bit weird but its also a reasonable series of events given the recent relationship events,MLeek
let the sister make nice and go to the reception as a guest not as a member of the wedding party,MLeek
id be less worried about controlling and more worried that hes masking his own serious doubts and real wants under well you cant really want this do you that way he doesnt have to take accountability or feel like the bad guy for leaving a relationship that doesnt meet his needs,MLeek
honestly dont beg someone to be with you,MLeek
ge needs to manage these feelings better himself it shouldnt be your parttime job in the relationship to build him up occasional insecurities are things we all feel but if this is a common tune in your relationship he needs to be told its not respectful or kind  and that if he keeps on saying hes not good enough one of these days youre gonna have to assume what he really means is that he doesnt want to continue with you,MLeek
its good you have some time together planned but in the meantime id put a foot down kindly but firmly youre an adult who is capable of her own choices and those choices deserve respect feeling insecure is one thing constantly questioning you is a different thing he needs to work on this,MLeek
i understand you dont think youre actively trying to claim power but if youre trying to say yay were a team lets solve this together partner when she fundamentally doesnt want to play then just youre deluding yourself and inviting more disappointment and frustration into your relationship and your own life,MLeek
youre lying to yourself about the situation because the situation is emotionally unpleasant for you,MLeek
support is great when someone wants it and is open to it when someone is not its just painful and insulting for both parties you cannot support her out of a thing she is comfortable choosing for herself support is not the issue there,MLeek
you dont need to turn your feelings off but there does come a point where you need to manage yourself and make choices for yourself not her you cannot make choices for her advocating for her against her will is not okay  and will not work,MLeek
if she genuinely doesnt want to quit and that does seem likely to be the outcome of any difficult conversations ahead then this is a you problem its a you problem about what kind of relationship youre willing to be in,MLeek
is he insecure or he is telling you that he believes youre not compatible,MLeek
do really believe youre compatible what are the steps youre planning to explore that or test living togeather or are these constant rounds of reassurance preventing you from having the serious adult think about that you need to have,MLeek
dont beg an adult to be with you hes plenty old enough to know himself and own his own shit if he believes youre not compatible in your lifestyles or careers he needs to own that not make it your problem to emotionally handle for him,MLeek
she doesnt want to quit shes not being open and honest with you about that because she knows damn well you dont want to hear that message you want to talk about what you can do together and she doesnt there isnt a together problem here there is a you problem its the one reality you dodge over and over age shes not trying because she doesnt particularly want to  certainly doesnt want to enough,MLeek
you keep coming back around and around about trying to support her but youre actually not on her team if shes not playing that game,MLeek
it doesnt matter how valid your concerns are or how supportive you want to be if shes just not motivated to change,MLeek
you do need to talk about this but its time to have the real talk where start trying to take ownership of the problems you cannot solve and stop claiming power over the ones you cannot the problems you can solve are you can stop kidding yourself you can stop approaching this as a team effort when its and never has been you can be honest about what kind of partnership youre willing to be in,MLeek
you just listed a bunch of reasons to absolutely not date her again but instead you remain fixated on the possibility she was recently in a relationship andor having sex with a woman and has chosen not to be transparent with you about that past relationship,MLeek
there is nothing here to accuse her of there is just someone to not date if that is how you feel about the possibility of a relationship with a woman in the recent past,MLeek
this is not about my hangups nothing you have said has changed my read on your behaviour the worst thing i can about her is that you allow her to bring out some ugly shit in you,MLeek
you need to wise up shes not hurting you right now shes not denying you anything youre entitled too youre hurting yourself with assumptions entitlements and baseless expectations,MLeek
youre noticing you dont actually want to date her  the person she actually is  and need to stop fucking around as if you might stop trying to make that into a story where shes a bad person own your own bullshit this is clearly not the woman for you,MLeek
it was on the list of a thousand reasons and just because shes not closeted doesnt mean she wants to deal with your weird fixation and invasive bullshit,MLeek
if i suspected you of the kind of assumptions and spinning out that youre engaging in with this question i 100 wouldnt give you any information about my previous relationships  especially if they werent heteropassing you do not appear able to handle it well,MLeek
stop spending so much time trying to read her mind and speak up for your damn self if there is something you want or need from this reconnection that you are not getting,MLeek
youre really not being much better than she is if youre choosing to keep the fact you believe they were in a romantic relationship from her,MLeek
your real problem here  the one you could actually control yourself  is the fact youre not being transparent about what you think you know or about what you want from this renewed connection all you have here is a bunch of assumptions and attempts to read her mind,MLeek
you dont know how they defined their relationship you dont even seem to know exactly how youre defining your connection with this woman right now,MLeek
stop accusing her of deceit when youre not being any more transparent and forthright than she is there are a thousand reasons she may be framing it the way she is including not wanting to out herself with you or face any of the typical random male judgement many bisexual women have to regularly face because this shit is often just so damn important to men who have no business with it anyways,MLeek
someone else cheated on him so youre not allowed to select your friends or your health care providers,MLeek
big nope,MLeek
cheating is devastating handling it respectfully doesnt mean becoming a controlling asshat with every other partner in your life,MLeek
let it go,MLeek
youre only hurting yourself by letting this bitterness fester,MLeek
get rid of it all quickly its not useful to you,MLeek
youre not wrong your bf is old enough to know better and it was reasonable not to want to discuss it over text,MLeek
and as much as you may not like t personally i suspect your bf is also a bit delusional,MLeek
i wouldnt date a guy so willfully out of touch with reality either about t or about my own legitimate anger with his shitty drunken behaviour,MLeek
dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls out,MLeek
its reasonable to want to date a man who is wearing clean underwear each day,MLeek
his insulting manipulative and flat out verbally abusive responses to this situation are serious red flags and raise big questions about his character  a much larger issue than his hygiene,MLeek
nah he doesnt get off quite that easily,MLeek
his forgetfulness about her limits is still a real problem he has been dodging the real conversations and considerations he needs to bring to this subject and is benefiting from her reasonable desire for equity and using that to manipulate her into spending way beyond her means,MLeek
op isnt perfect but the fact op would like to keep some equity in the relationship when it comes to meals out doesnt mean he isnt also a willfully stupid and selfish asshat,MLeek
he certainly could lots of people would,MLeek
but if he doesnt want to  or even if op does not want that dynamic  then he lives with her within her limits and stops constantly pressuring her with his forgetfulness and emotional manipulation,MLeek
in the context of him constantly forgetting that shes a fulltime student on a budget that wasnt a genuine offer just manipulation a genuine offer would have sounded like of course not could you bake a cakeplan a movie date thatd be lovely,MLeek
hes not as dumb as hes pretending to be hes as dumb as is convenient for him to be,MLeek
op does need to do better but when she does this relationship will likely come to an end because of course she doesnt want to have to be constantly reminding him of things a reasonable person could retain without difficult and op cannot properly communicate her way out of his kind of bullshit,MLeek
what makes perfect sense about it general labour is an absurd term almost meaningless to take them as a group,MLeek
some general labour makes 7 an hour other general labour makes 100k a year the difference is industry unions and tradition not skill or even capital generation,MLeek
if we have social programs to subsidize some kinds of labour that you imagine dont generate enough capital to pay a living wage then were not protecting individuals in society at all were only protecting illusionary profits for the executives and owners,MLeek
do you think your boyfriend is a complete fucking moron because you shouldnt date complete fucking morons and either he is too dumb to date or he is playing stupid to avoid the real compromises and conversations that are required in a relationship where there is a financial imbalance,MLeek
its not rocket science that you have no income,MLeek
youre not making him feel guilty you are trying to live within your means he should feel embarrassed by his willful ignorance and the ongoing issues of his inconsiderate behaviours when it comes to the expectations he places on you to spend,MLeek
this man needs to hurt he should be hurting,MLeek
if he says hes feeling guilty and hurting right now say good you need to feel this pain as well because you keep putting financial expectations on me that are not reasonable and any halfway intelligent person would know they arent reasonable for a fulltime student with no income its not fair that i have to constantly carry the pain of trying to keep up with you and communicate this to you over and over again i need to say no more and you need to be more considerate and thoughtful and actually listen when i say no,MLeek
he needs to feel the pain of his stupid inconsiderate behaviour because you are describing an adult man who is either too dumb to bother dating or who is just so blissfully selfish as to not see that going dutch on dinner at restaurants several times a week is not feasible for a fulltime student,MLeek
he should feel guilty about how he has arranged the expectations about money in this relationship he has been selfish and stupid guilt is the proper emotional response to being regularly unkind to you as a partner,MLeek
people like you have arbitrarily decided some labourers dont deserve to eat,MLeek
right she got a salary of 11 million and 39 million in stock awards and other forms of compensation,MLeek
not much of a defence really that the average joe doesnt understand how executive compensation is structured the end result is the same her pay appears not be tied to performance and think of the companys needs  but everyone elses is,MLeek
shes not into whatever youre asking for however basic you may feel it may be shes not into it,MLeek
the rest of your relationship works because you have similar values and needs in other aspects of the partnership in this area you dont,MLeek
you need to make a choice about the kind of relationship you can commit too and how much communication on the subject you can invest,MLeek
in the end though if she doesnt want what you want her to want there is no way to communicate past that there isnt much to work on there either you can make someone make an effort sometimes but you cannot make someone sincerely want something for themselves they just dont,MLeek
why wont he have a diploma and a drivers licence,MLeek
unless his parents are abusive or his home life is so unstable hes not able to get those things completed while living at home then i would make both of those a requirement as well as the job if he leaves home without those things its exceedingly unlikely hell get them,MLeek
if you dont want a roommate dont agree to do this hes looking for an easy escape but if hes not already doing the work to complete his diploma and take safe steps forward hes not gonna do that work living with you two either once hes in youre not getting him out until he gets really uncomfortable in your home,MLeek
would be way more turned off by someone who has already declared i will reject them than i would by someone who has lived a damn life by age 46,MLeek
id be a bit resentful too if i thought i was entering a partnership where my opinion would matter at all and my longterm safety would be a factor to consider and it turned out i was just a tenant whose rent fluctuate based on repairs a bit of resentment is a rational response to a situation where op mistakenly believed she would be a larger part of the longterm planning than she is,MLeek
we dont know that op is extremely disempowered,MLeek
please we can be reasonable adults about this we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out,MLeek
op did choose to enter the marriage on these terms  she can be held accountable for that  but the current situation does leave her deeply disempowered and with far more limited choices than her wife has reserved for herself and that is something they are both responsible for addressing,MLeek
the main gripe here is clearly about security and partnership even if op loved the home and it was in good repair there would still be some concerns here about ops ability to create a secure longterm plan,MLeek
im actually realizing that while i might be married financially im still single,MLeek
while this is frustrating and sad for you i think its an important realization and something to share with her her choices have left your longterm financial security up to you because her plans dont meet your needs or leave you feeling secure and reasonably they shouldnt,MLeek
so youre going to have to make your plans independent of hers and one of the things that require from her right now is that rent is just rent it doesnt change because she needs to make capital improvements or repairs the two of you need to settle on a reasonable market rate and then that is the money she gets from you towards the home if shes not prepared to plan with you then she doesnt get to rely on your additional support for her personal homeownership plans,MLeek
but the market rate rent shouldnt change because the owner needs to make repairs the owner just needs to make the repairs,MLeek
ops wife has set up a system where op is extremely disempowered in all choices from where to live to what repairs to prioritize and even what the rent actually is each month and prone to emotional manipulation to take on more risksresponsibilitiescosts for home ownership without any of the rewards or rights op is totally right to see this situation as insecure and unsafe financially for herself,MLeek
you both need some serious financial advice and ideally from someone who has experiencing working with couples,MLeek
a rental agreement that changes on the basis of necessary repairs isnt a rental agreement,MLeek
right now your wife has the benefit of a secure tenant you without the real obligations to a committed a life partner also you youre not feeling secure because you are not a secure and respected partner in the home youre a tenant who is easily manipulated emotionally by status as wifey whenever it is convenient and then demoted to tenant whenever that is more convenient,MLeek
if your partner isnt willing to change that situation then i think you need to take a step back and think like a renter,MLeek
the current agreement means you are basically single and renting from a financial perspective and you should make your plans based on that if youre renting at 58 and still renting at 67 you need to know what you can afford in rent and be prepared to say no to major repairs and capital improvements to a home you merely rent in you need a tenancy agreement on paper and the rent should only be raised in accordance with local laws or at market rates not based on your partners needs in that way you can plan for your retirement independently from your wifes property plans,MLeek
you sound like you have totally incompatible goals about how to spend money and time if you dont want to fund her travels you need to be honest about that,MLeek
while there is no shame in living at home its perfectly fair for her to say it makes you incompatible with her as a partner,MLeek
if i had been dating someone for three years and they preferred saving money at home to starting a shared life with me id be questioning the relationship as well a lot of women you date at this age will not want to date someone who still lives at home simply because of the restrictions it creates on the relationship,MLeek
youve indenified the right problem,MLeek
he told you not to expect him to moderate his behaviour properly hes making excuses for the next time he behaves badly when he doesnt get his way its important for adults to be able to roll with a bit of inconvenience or disappointment without acting like little shits or worse,MLeek
i would date a guy who said im sorry its something im working on but not a guy who said im sorry but its just who i am so youre going to have to accept it sometimes,MLeek
dont date someone who spends the first few weeks warning you they are going to treat you poorly they will and then they will turn around and blame you for not accepting the shitty treatment,MLeek
dont speak to what he feels or what he knows dont make assumptions or put words in his mouth dont be condescending,MLeek
dont create false hope the idea that you may change your mind or get back together some day are normal fantasies to have but they are almost always fantasies right now its a break up because you want to break up,MLeek
speak for yourself and speak honestly youre happy you dont feel youre compatible you want to break up,MLeek
the first thing you do to get through this is abandon all illusions of control,MLeek
there are no perfect words or magic incantation that make this go perfectly smoothly and gives you everything you want  including the vague hope of a future where you reconnect,MLeek
be clear to be kind dont let it be drawn out unnecessarily dont get into a debate dont pursue closure closure is a thing for you each to figure out on your own its not work you do together,MLeek
remember that he doesnt owe you friendship any more than you owe him a relationship you can ask for what you want but in the end if he doesnt also want that or if he wants to set this bridge on fire and piss on the flames there is nothing you can do to change that,MLeek
this is all more than a little silly,MLeek
i have rarely been the only person with my name in any class or workplace,MLeek
your gf could go by that name she is currently choosing not for her own reasons consideration convenience or anything else ifwhen your gf chooses to go primarily by that name she can and will,MLeek
my mother and my partners mother have the exact same name its only very occasionally confusion we know who is who,MLeek
hes probably not the safest or healthiest person for you to seek support from for these big feelings,MLeek
for that reason i wouldnt do it you need and deserve support far more than he has any right to know what was in the end a personal medical event your ex is just not the right place to go looking for that comfort and empathy a week after the breakup,MLeek
tell him to stop bringing it up unprompted its unwelcome this is the opposite of helpful,MLeek
hes only making another barrier for you and making it a bit harder for you to be honest and transparent with him  because you dont want to have to manage his feelings about it,MLeek
tell him in no uncertain terms to back the hell off if he means well then he needs to do well and doing well right now means shutting up completely about this for a least a few weeks,MLeek
she a mentally ill addict with ten years on you,MLeek
you dont handle her you handle you and you step away from a connection that is not healthy or productive for you,MLeek
this before the reunion i was willing to cut marshall a lot a slack for being an imperfect human being in a very shitty situation,MLeek
now i just plain old dont like him hes not a monster just a big ole nope,MLeek
jordon peterson retired from uoft he had not taught since 2017 which is a polite way of saying he was no longer welcome or productive in any serious academic environment and hadnt been for a long while,MLeek
hes a grifter he found a more lucrative grift on the radicalization pipeline,MLeek
he did not and will not respect transgendered students he was never threatened with jail for misgendering of his students he was fundamentally mischaracterising the law he was merely sternly reminded by his employer that he was expected to treat individuals on campus with respect after he went in the record saying he may choose not too respect if an individuals pronouns if he decides they were being political or had a chip on their shoulder about it,MLeek
the ontario college of psychologists is positioned to discipline him and remove his license  not because of his transphobia  but because of his shameless trolling grandiosity attentionbaiting and pontificating on subjects way outside of his areas of competence if you want to behave like joe rogen you dont get to keep your license as a clinician,MLeek
and no official position on homosexuality is laughable attempt at a defence did you really type that with a straight face if you did you may want to read up on his official positions on climate change thats funnier and makes it all the more concerning if paul is following him unironically,MLeek
id been skeptical of this reading of him until the reunion he didnt mean nurturing he absolutely meant submissive and servile and he didnt tell her because the first rule of these philosophies is that you never tell a woman plainly what you actually think of her or her entire gender,MLeek
i dont like micah very much but i do believe she sincerely grew during this experience  and she needed too she seemed far younger than her actual 27 years  but her real crime with paul seems to be she wasnt quite malleable enough,MLeek
no man what she knows is she can do what she wants and then punish you for a while if you dare to point out shes being shitty,MLeek
that what she knows to expect,MLeek
if you dont want to date someone who behaves this way then you have to not date someone who behaves this way,MLeek
why on earth would you want to marry this woman she understands just fine she understands she can bully and torture you into even considering this absurdity,MLeek
and thats exactly the dynamic you want to maintain her looking ridiculous you looking bored,MLeek
keep the rest of this to yourself,MLeek
thats precisely my point,MLeek
this emotional reaction is as much as a threat to you if not more than her behaviour and this you can control her behaviour you cannot,MLeek
if you accept her premise that this is a war others will play along and enjoy the show immensely and youre far more likely to loose some battles along the way,MLeek
i didnt mean give her grace for her own sake i meant manage yourself because the thoughts you allow to fester will leak out and could  impact the outcome here,MLeek
just bring a bit of grace to the situation,MLeek
even if she an awful paranoid little drama llama she had the misfortune to fall in with an abuser who would take advantage of those qualities to keep this even more toxic and dangerous her than they might otherwise be,MLeek
we dont have to like a person or agree with their choices to recognize they are also being harmed,MLeek
dont let her off the hook for her actions but keep your own thoughts free of malice,MLeek
yeah thats the shit you have to not give into the temptation to tell your coworkers dont say anything that would contribute to the narrative besides i am not surprised he has lied about me i really just want nothing to do with him,MLeek
dont get put on the defensive and dont become part of the story dont give them more to talk about or compare notes over the story in the workplace cannot be about your relationship from 15 years ago the story needs to be sandrine is really weird and running her mouth and op is just shrugging and saying not surprised but not interested,MLeek
besides documenting what youre hearing and how this impacting you in the workplace there is nothing to do a big reaction from you only validates their private little drama,MLeek
being disinterested and bored by her behaviour is what others will see its far better for you if you can ride this out until her behaviour is unpleasant for others,MLeek
nothing you keep doing nothing,MLeek
you let sandrine have her space and you speak to your boss if her avoidance is impacting your work,MLeek
shes frightened of him of the stories shes told been told its really not about you but entirely about his fictions if anyone asks you that is what you say it was a long time ago but if he is still anything like the man i knew im not surprised he has her frightened he was very manipulative in the past i want nothing to do with him and i am happy for sandrine to maintain whatever boundary she needs as long as we can work together cordially,MLeek
i know its hard to keep your cool but its your only shield disinterest is your best defence if someone asks you express some slight pity but understanding and reiterate i am not involved i will not get involved i am happy not speaking about him or to him i want no contact with him and sandrine and i can have civil workplace contact and nothing else,MLeek
sadie may have attentionseeking behaviours but this wasnt an example of one,MLeek
this was an example of you having some others issues with sadie and looking rather hard for a reason to confront her about her reasonable choice,MLeek
if you dont like your friends dont be friends if you like your friends stop micromanaging them and accusing them of shit,MLeek
if you want to fix this apologize for sticking your nose in shit that is absolutely none of your business without making excuses or trying to justify yourself she may still not want to be your friend anymore i wouldnt want to be friends with you if you were gonna make accusations over changing my top in a car,MLeek
one of the most common fantasies out there for heterosexual women,MLeek
this is just entirely personal reflection but i found that my ravishment and consensual nonconsent fantasies diminished a great deal as i became more comfortable expressing my own sexual desires for me they were a way to not be blamed not to be responsible for what i wanted i felt like i didnt have many healthy ways that i was allowed to say i like sex i am a woman with a higher libido and all the messages i got from most of my life where that i needed to be sort of a passive recipient lots of men and women responded negatively if i took on the role of pursuer or if i was really direct about what i wanted took me a long time and my life to unpack that i still enjoy that sort of play but its a much smaller part of the mix for me now,MLeek
not a danger flag but certainly a sign of incompatibility and disrespect,MLeek
his reaction is far far more weird than keeping a childhood toy,MLeek
some other things women consent to do when it benefits them,MLeek
load trucks,MLeek
operate cash resisters,MLeek
design buildings,MLeek
write code,MLeek
operate on brains,MLeek
women are so weird s,MLeek
his fees fees,MLeek
i mean hes super logical and not irrationally emotional like those females so there must be something factual behind his intense feelings right s,MLeek
it seems likely that your grandfather might have some age related difficulties,MLeek
i would recommend that you set a consistent time that you speak to your grandfather pick some thing that would work in your schedule and then stick to it religiously maybe early mornings would be great if hes an early riser,MLeek
as my great aunt got older i spoke to her for 20 minutes early in the morning on wednesdays and then spoke to her a little bit longer on sunday evenings other than that i screened her calls she was bored and confused often and i felt for her we were both most comfortable with really clear expectations about when i would contact her,MLeek
youre describing pretty normal dating for most normal people yes it absolutely does suck yes youre going to have a lot more rejection then dates you dont know whats going on in someone elses life and in the sorts of situation you never will,MLeek
you need to make sure that you filled your life with some other joys as well youre putting way too much into these initial connections it can be a tough roller coaster to ride but you got a level of the emotional floor a bit,MLeek
i mean this isnt working youre on again off again for a year you know this isnt working,MLeek
and shes was right she might also be petty and drama seeking but shes right telling you take a job you wanted to take and move for is quite different than you telling her what she needs in a relationship,MLeek
stop having stupid side fights this is over it wasnt working youre leaving have some damn graciousness,MLeek
if were nitpicking a 27 year old is not a girl,MLeek
if youre in an ldr with no immediate plans to be movelive together with if is appropriate for any plan that isnt the confirmed,MLeek
be honest and direct with her about your intentions clarity is important and scary to say things with certainty in these cases if shes hedging make is clear you mean to take these next steps,MLeek
the vast majority of photographers are going to have periods in their life of this sort of work if not make their whole career on it naked women sell shit,MLeek
if you dont trust his character in a room with a naked professional dont date him,MLeek
if he cannot address your discomfort without immediately talking about permission and artistic freedom dont date him he should be addressing your fears by talking about professionalism respect boundaries and goals were talking about collaborating with other people this isnt aboutma freedum or ma arts this is about being a good collaborator and creator with purpose,MLeek
youre not shitty to tell him youre uncomfortable hes handling this totally reasonable conversation in a super immature way,MLeek
this,MLeek
i think this is where youre messing up  for me casual still includes a fair bit of friendship not necessarily dating or romantic activities but i definitely want you actually know youre person i want to talk to and spend a few hours with,MLeek
a drink and a fuck is a hook up maybe ongoing hook ups but a step down from casual in my book the word youre looking for a hook up,MLeek
yes it matters its gonna matter especially if your life stages diverge,MLeek
that doesnt mean it wont work out or that hes doing anything terribly wrong but dont be naive and pretend the gap doesnt exist dont be willfully blind youre not ageless thats a justification and a delusion,MLeek
and they always say youre really mature the 40 year olds who rape 12 year old say that the power dynamics fester because they are not immediately obvious to the younger person and the elder person enjoys them being mature for your age is totally different from being a compatible peer with someone who is older,MLeek
this is something youre going to have to keep eyes open to for several years in this relationship there is no dodging it its a challenge and a risk that exists here,MLeek
its been 24 hours the window is closing fast,MLeek
in my opinion what you really need to do is stop having sex and figure out how to manage your anxiety andor prevent condom breakage,MLeek
plan b is a plan b for some women it doesnt have much of an impact for others it is positively miserable thats before we get to the expense while you should be open with her about your anxiety and concerns that is a pretty big ask of her just because something felt off,MLeek
if this is where youre at mentally you shouldnt be having sex until you have a better shared contraception plan and a personal anxiety management plan there isnt a physical problem here with her body that requires pharmaceutical intervention there is a core problem here with your comfort level with sex and its risks,MLeek
your parents are going to start drama if they want to its understandable for them to be a bit disappointed put anything past that is a choice,MLeek
accept this theres no magic collection of words you can say to control that or make them feel a certain way about the situation they are going to feel how they feel and do what they do,MLeek
tell them youre looking forward to their visit and recommend a hotel if its an issue of money then maybe you want to contribute to the hotel bill,MLeek
honestly though this shouldve been sorted out when the invitation was made it shouldnt have been held off until a few weeks before they arrive it shouldve been part of the structure of the invitation so all parties knew exactly what they were getting into in the future you need to make this a core part of the planning from the very beginning dont bring it up after the date are set,MLeek
you may also consider just telling them the truth they havent always been consistently nice to your wife so in order to keep the peace you were making sure that they and your wife and you have space apart from one another during the visit tell them youre not open to reconsidering this at this time because you feel its been working well and you believe the relationship has been improving with these sorts of boundaries in place,MLeek
you need a sensible lawyers advice on other ways to think about this,MLeek
its totally reasonable for her to want to feel she is building equity and is fully invested but a 5050 split is probably not going create the best overall living situation for the both of you,MLeek
the other way forward it to start shopping in your price range when my partner and i began i was the lower earned and he was keen on 5050 when he saw the reality of what a place that was 5050 looked like as opposed to a place that was split based on income 6535 he rapidly changed his mind she may also change her mind if confronted with the real limits of her budget as opposed to our budget or you may be the one to change your mind and see other opportunities to invest capital besides your primary home,MLeek
you werent rude and id have been rude sooner i just say please dont touch me ideally loud enough for others to hear clearly and less in the tone of pretty please and more in the tone of wtf you think youre doing i will break you fingers,MLeek
nothing good has ever come of letting someone touch me twice,MLeek
hints are for people who are being nice randos with their hands on me arent nice and i dont have be nice back we aint in kindergarten anymore you keep your damn hands to yourself,MLeek
ew,MLeek
i mean i dont wish harm on anyone and they would be out of the dating pool in theory,MLeek
but ew,MLeek
strange most of the people who have been resentful of my promotions have been men where they secretly women,MLeek
it would be a lovely thing if incels and mens right activists decided to get behind pubic transit investment,MLeek
i can believe it im only just a ice average height but if i put on big boots and a mean face i can improve my odds drastically down town,MLeek
this might blow back on him,MLeek
guy once asked me to read moon is a harsh mistress cause it was so formative for him i did when asked what i thought i said the pacing was horrible and i was deeply concerned by the books attitudes towards woman as supporting cast members in mens lives and that stranger in a strange land was a far far better book overall,MLeek
dont tell a 20something intellectual that youve read more heinlein than they have and you have some notes,MLeek
she says in the op she is in therapy and that all the miscarriages were in the last year,MLeek
it strains credulity to imagine he was unaware of all of those miscarriages and the therapy appointments but sure suppose its possible,MLeek
sure how could any other adult human being be expected to imagine that three miscarriages including a secondtrimester one which has op seeking therapy might be impacting her emotional state right now how absurd of us to expect an adult partner to maybe ask her if shes ok tell her its totally understandable if she has a lot of big feels say shit like well be in together no matter what happens or even im proud of you and well get through this instead of telling her shes not being nice enough to him and considerate enough of his feelings,MLeek
s,MLeek
for fucks sake men have us so conned i dont think op is handling this perfectly but the idea that hes incapable of better is embarrassing very few men are as stupid and incompetent as they like to pretend to be when not getting what they want,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
there doesnt seem to be a problem here  except possibly you realize just how much labour will be involved in maintaining completely separate finances while moving towards a more and more joined life,MLeek
as long as youre comfortable forgoing any interest on these payments then an email agreement between you two would probably be sufficient,MLeek
serves me and doesnt have enough experience to realize that is a shit deal,MLeek
modern chivalry is just called consideration,MLeek
its concerning anyone is still clinging a philosophy that boiled down to stop raping and thieving so much just cause you have the swords youre upsetting the poors,MLeek
you cant control other peoples reactions,MLeek
most peoples friends and family dont want to know details about their sex life,MLeek
it is risky to speak to a friend about something like this for a first time you have to make the choice based on what you know about the individual people here arent going to be able to help you much with that rando opinions on reddit definitely arent going to help,MLeek
he only noticed this because of his asian fetish,MLeek
if you watch any busy sidewalk for 10 mins youll see the vast majority of young women yield to men of all ages unless there is a walker or stroller involved most women yield and most men claim their space in public,MLeek
you can find lots of anecdotal stories out there from women who decided to stop yielding and moving out of the way for others and they all say the same thing women moved to avoid them men knocked into them its a fun experiment if you can put up with some bruising google manslamming,MLeek
bisexuals can be lovely loyal parters,MLeek
bisexuals can also be cheating gaslighting assholes,MLeek
you know which one youre dealing with,MLeek
thats called dating,MLeek
for everyone 100 matches you get maybe 10 conversations for every 100 conversations maybe 10 dates for every 10 first dates maybe one second date,MLeek
there doesnt need to be anything wrong with you dating is hard and most people you meet with you wont click with these women are doing you a favor please stop assuming they are being unfair or stupid they arent,MLeek
and youre not really all that into these women either youre just bent out of shape because they got to do the rejecting let go of that bullshit and recognize that this is going to take a larger time commitment and more effort if you want to find a serious relationship,MLeek
there are lots of idiots on reddit who dont think men should have feelings or normal human vulnerabilities or sentimentalities best to just ignore their trolling,MLeek
id bet youre right she was likely taught this in therapy,MLeek
standins or proxies like this are a tool therapists will sometimes suggest to help people  and not just children  communicate or signal they are ready to communicate about difficult things,MLeek
while i wouldnt enjoy it its not necessarily unhealthy i wouldnt be overly concerned about it but you should be able to ask her questions about this tool and how it works for her and express discomfort if you have any,MLeek
in an ideal world she would have discussed this technique with your prior to implementing it in your relationship but its possible that its so natural and normal to her she didnt realize it would be strange for someone else to be on the receiving end of it for the first time,MLeek
yeah and i believe arnolds son with maria shriver did choose to work out moredifferently and change his look later on in life there is no bodyshaming here guy on the right just looks like a normal human being and not someone who is necessarily pursuing a career as an action movie star which is what is happening,MLeek
in the image above the child he had with the housekeeper and hid is the one on the left the data was already wrong and  they held the charts upside down,MLeek
they didnt arnold had a child with the housekeeper and hid it from the rest of his family for over a decade,MLeek
and he held the charts upside down,MLeek
biology and his own ignorance about the impact of miscarriages and grief have isolated him you didnt do it to him hes a full participant in this dynamic and he is not putting in the work to address it,MLeek
try to open up to him about your fears and stress explain to him that while his optimism and happiness is lovely for him it can be exhausting work for you to both manage your complex feelings and your body and also be made responsible for addressing his feelings in the way he enjoys most,MLeek
you would benefit from being more open with him but he also needs be a much safer and more empathetic person to be open with your feelings are valid and you will not always have the bandwidth to take care of his too he needs to do better and recognize the actual valid emotional complexity of this situation for you he cannot just steamroll you with me me meing,MLeek
and it wasnt like at all what happened,MLeek
but the one who was raised by the mother is the buff one in the left arnold didnt acknowledge him until he was publicly shamed into it when the kid was like 14,MLeek
it was the dude on the right who was raised by arnold for fucks sake maria shriver is standing right behind him and also fuck that noise hes not a movie star so he doesnt to do the work to look like one me neither,MLeek
howd you get ask her how shes feeling from constant texting and asking if im going to leave him,MLeek
hes a bully being insecure or confused doesnt make you not also a bully,MLeek
have you talked about it,MLeek
it doesnt seem completely unreasonable as neither of you appears to have planned sex into the equation,MLeek
i think its actually an important stage in a couples relationship when you can spend time together without having sex but given the whole context of this ldr this is a thing you need to talk about and you need to do it before you leave its not fair to either of you to carry this anxiety and not attempt to resolve it and understand one another while youre together,MLeek
if you want to date paul your friendship with jay is probably over,MLeek
you dont always get everything you want outta life jays feelings may not be rational but hes entitled to them and hes not obligated to be your friend or pretend to be your friend if he is not able to be at peace with your choices,MLeek
youre making some bad choices most people are gonna think that after youre caught having sex with a teenager in a public parking lot and its a reasonable thing to think,MLeek
you may not mean to but at 25 you should be aware that 18yearolds are not responsible partners for you even casually it says a concerning thing about your character and your sense that you didnt know that every 40yearold dating an 18yearold says they are pretty mature as well  thats not a reasonable argument of course they are its not about them its about what it says about you,MLeek
the fact there are also sexist assumptions about different age gaps when the genders or sexuality is different is also not a reasonable argument for your particular situation youre making poor choices to get involved sexually with an 18 year old your expectations and needs in any sort of relationship even a fwbs one should be pretty damn different from an 18yearolds,MLeek
while you do not owe anyone any answers to their questions about your sex life those people who know youre fucking at 18 year old are not obligated to like it and are allowed to think poorly of you for it,MLeek
this man is trash and hes bringing out the absolute worst in you,MLeek
go make better choices with someone better,MLeek
there is no magic sequences of words that perfectly control how another person feels,MLeek
i gave you the script below do that,MLeek
id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that,MLeek
you ask because you were worried it would sound accusatory,MLeek
dude,MLeek
if its something important to you that would make you feel more comfortable and secure with your contraceptive plan and sex life with her yes,MLeek
that doesnt mean there is no risk of her reacting poorly  the risk does exist but its a reasonable thing to ask and itd be good to know if shes not a reasonable person about it,MLeek
they dont happen randomly you do have to be exposed to them the t means transmitted but many people are asymptomatic and dont know they have any of them,MLeek
your request for an sti test is reasonable it doesnt mean you dont trust her its just a better safe than sorry sort of situation for you both before you continue with barrierfree sex,MLeek
she would have symptoms if she had an std,MLeek
this is literally the worst most wrongheaded medical advice you could have possibly offered,MLeek
your first example chlamydia can be asymptomatic for years,MLeek
thats exactly how you do it,MLeek
id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that,MLeek
you dont have perfect control over her reactions but you know your request is reasonable and thats the way to say it,MLeek
its not too much,MLeek
but if you want to be clear send him a very very short and very cold message that says something like this contact is unwanted do not send me any more communications in any channel or form if you do the next person who explains to you why this is not acceptable with be a police officer,MLeek
break up,MLeek
you are not bringing the security and respect to this relationship that is absolutely necessary for it to be a healthy one for either of you,MLeek
either speak to a therapist to do the work by yourself because its all your work to make peace with the reality of women as full human beings with inherent value regardless of thier sexual past or break up and find a relationship that doesnt trigger the worst parts of your character in this way,MLeek
there isnt a lot of great advice here man this is a you problem either you fix it or you dont if you dont wont or cant then you end this relationship and relationship where you fail to respect your partners past,MLeek
those absolutely can be emotionally abusive things to say especially if he doesnt take accountability for them makes it your job to resolve his violations and continues the behavior,MLeek
have you considered this man might have a lot more experience masking his really shitty behaviour than you do seeing through this sort of manipulation,MLeek
people dont generally date 10 years younger than them because they are looking for a balanced respectful relationship between equals,MLeek
we forgive people for mistakes we dont forgive people for actively creating and maintaining a relationship where they get to treat us like shit whenever it pleases them to do so,MLeek
seems like shes been pretty clear and consistent,MLeek
if you still have feelings then you need to end or really minimize this contact,MLeek
shes not respecting your boundaries and leaving you confused and hurting that isnt a friendship that is working out for you you can try to be clear again we cannot be friends if you keep joking about having sex with me after ive asked you to stop or you can just take the big step back right now,MLeek
tell him you are beaking up tell him you dont want any further contact its not a conversation or a discussion there is no closure just tell him what is happening and then do it,MLeek
block him on everything start recording any violations of the block so you can have the cops or other adults explain the situation if he continues to try to reach you and bully you,MLeek
refuse delivery on anything he has sent if you cannot dont acknowledge it,MLeek
a breakup isnt a negotiation and hes not being kind hes being a shitty little bully cut him out entirely and dont feel badly about removing someone from your life who doesnt respect you when you speak,MLeek
eh its pretty good so far,MLeek
good luck with it if you can learn try to be kind to yourself and others even when youre disappointed and frustrated youll have a way better and easier time of it too,MLeek
do you actually want to marry this guy,MLeek
cause it sounds like youre looking for reasons to label him not good enough after four years together and saying yes you should know who youre marrying and you should know if he knows you and listens to your needs and expectations well enough,MLeek
you and most people usually keep on trying a bit longer than it makes any sense id say walk away now but you probably arent going too,MLeek
so my advice would be to stop when you find yourself resenting her and making unfairunreasonable judgments about her character just because shes not giving you what you want,MLeek
the best thing to learn is that its okay to just break up with someone a good person who just isnt good for you dont give into the urge to turn them into a bad bad person in your own head before you give yourself permission to walk away from a pretty good person who is just not a pretty good person for you that will save you a lot of drama and stress in life if you learn to stop and walk before you demonize someone who has done nothing really except disappoint you,MLeek
it sounds like youre just not feeling secure and compatible,MLeek
thats not really about texting,MLeek
its a month in you shouldnt be using words like expectations and accommodating with these heavily negative connotations so early on this just isnt working for you stop trying to turn her into a monster in your own head before youre willing to admit this just isnt working for you,MLeek
you need to calm the fuck down,MLeek
not everyone engages with text the same way thats actually not all generational even among the same generation different people have different patterns and priorities,MLeek
its okay to express what you need and want but youve known her long enough now to suspect that her preferred method of communication is inperson that doesnt make her evil or even disinterested it makes her different the fact you are jumping to the assumption shes lying or gameplaying is a red flag  on you,MLeek
in the short term ask her if a 2030 minute video call between dates or a phone call would work for her it might help you feel connected your feelings do need to be addressed if this connection is gonna work out  but mostly by you not all by her  and bring them down like 8 notches and recognize that her norms around texting are also totally valid there is nothing not proper about her choice not to stalk you on social media all the time you want to talk about your shooting then talk to her as a person not a follower or audience member stop it with the nasty assumptions about her character because shes not reading your mind and serving your texting preferences,MLeek
your girlfriend is accurately understanding that 17 is very different from 22 and is kicking herself for an error in judgment she made years ago this is not about the legal age of consent this is about her own standards for herself and her belief she didnt meet them,MLeek
the best thing you can do is be honest with her about feeling empowered and free to choose in the relationship and accept the fact that just because she feel guilt or thinks she made a mistake doesnt mean the relationship was or is broken now,MLeek
stop trying to tell her it wasnt that bad thats not gonna work instead tell her you admire how she has set out to respect you and value you despite the age difference and that you dont want this mistake that you dont necessarily agree was a mistake but can respect she does to damage the great relationship you have now nine years later as equals,MLeek
the only person who can offer any particular helpful explanations is her and shes not doing that shes said no to speaking to a doctor or therapist who could help her do that you dont get to know right now,MLeek
of course pregnancy hormones could be impacting her but if she wont speak to a doctor about her emotional state then there is nothing you can do about that,MLeek
it really sounds like youre looking for ways to make her change back and that isnt going to work you can only address the things shes doing and saying to you and what youre willing to accept in the friendship,MLeek
stop trying to change her admit it when you cannot support her or accept her negativity telling her that isnt leaving her in the dark place not telling her the truth is abandoning her and will leave her more confused and hurt that her longtime friends dont want to talk to her anymore at least give her the respect of telling her why youre withdrawing from these conversations  cause she already knows youre not happy with her and youre withdrawing from her,MLeek
i require monogamy sexual exclusivity in a partner,MLeek
put it to him that plainly we all have fantasies and crushes you cannot do everything or everyone in life you want too,MLeek
if you do not want an open relationship of any kind say so clearly and firmly if you never want a threesome or never with this particular woman hes been crushing on for ages say so directly,MLeek
your boyfriend and immature and craves validation its not the sort of guy id want to even have an open relationship with to be honest openness and nonmonogamy requires way more selfawareness consideration and rationality than hes displayed here so far,MLeek
you dont have to be friends with someone you dont want to be friends with,MLeek
i agree you need to support your spouse through grief but i think you need to stop assuming you have perfect insight into their marriage if you cant support her in this just admit that and opt out,MLeek
besides the incident with the xanax the rest of this sounds like she is rather legitimately angry with an inconsiderate husband and boundarybusting inlaws,MLeek
you should admit that her concerns and the intensity of her feelings are way beyond what you can help her with as a friends and encourage her to speak to a therapist or counsellor  you cannot give her the support shes looking for,MLeek
stop trying to calm her down tell her shes right that sucks and you dont know how to help if shes thinking of divorce and feeling that angry that often she should talk to a mental health professional she needs and deserves that support,MLeek
youre not equiped to be in a longterm committed relationship,MLeek
do not have a fling be an adult and break up if youre not interested in the same sort of committed relationship agreement that your gf is,MLeek
talk to your husband you need to let him in on this struggle youre having,MLeek
hell probably tell you exactly what im going to tell you if he hasnt already this man is not your friend hes never been your friend that was never his intention hes your hostagetaker he doesnt value your friendship he values the illusion of intimacy including some lowkey sexual intimacy that he is manipulating and obligating you to perform for him,MLeek
regardless of what your husband says i would tell your friend that your husband has seen his comments about divorce and his compliments and your husband is insisting this is inappropriate and that you need to end the friendship then you can block him you can apologize but say you need to focus on your marriage its not totally untrue and you can ignore any future contact unless you need to call 911 to go make sure hes no dead,MLeek
men have a very bad habit of respecting other mens property rights over their wives and girlfriend more than they respect those actual women when they speak when a man is treating me poorly i will happily use this misogyny against him to make him stop abusing my kindness,MLeek
while i agree her behaviour is imperfect there is something to be said for being more aggressive in group settings if the norm in the group includes dominant or fastpaced talkers like your gf,MLeek
your gf should be willing to moderate her behaviour however shes not solely responsible for your feelings of alienation its also on you to come up with your own strategies for handling that,MLeek
it might mean turning and starting another oneonone conversation i do this a lot in groups where one person tends to dominate i see if i can start a second quieter conversation with one other person its not a play you can see if someone else will engage with you while the louder person is lecturing the group it also might mean asking other people questions about things your gf does not know details about it might mean introducing a topic of conversation where you have more to say than your gf does,MLeek
your gf is in the wrong but this is also part of her nature that probably is never going to be completely resolved to your personal preferences and shes not the only one who needs to be a part of the solution here talking to her about the steps youre taking to feel more included in group conversations might even help give her some small things she can do to support you instead of making it all her job to make you feel included,MLeek
if the problem persists then you might be fundementally incompatible but id address this first as something you need to change your approachtactics on not something she has to gift you,MLeek
youre willfully ignorant of your own behaviours and feelings and of how those behaviours will be reasonably experienced by others and probably struggle to say simple things like im concerned or im feeling confused about the boundaries with this dude,MLeek
communication is gonna be rough good luck with it,MLeek
where in the post did i say it was the third or fourth time ive said this,MLeek
i didnt say it was i said especially if was this the first time you brought it up think again was it really the first time you expressed negative feelings towards her coworker and this friendship do you really think she wasnt picking up on your feelings toward him earlier than this possible not likely,MLeek
asking how close she is with someone isnt an insult at all,MLeek
dude this shit just doesnt work you cannot be willfully ignorant of the subtext and think its gonna work out well,MLeek
give yourself a smack up the head and be honest about your own shit she reasonably felt attacked because you did attack her behaviours instead of owning and acknowledging your own feelings of discomfort or concerns feelings which were valid and you could have expressed without the but im just asking questions bullshit games,MLeek
it was an accusation not a question you knew it she knew it what you meant to say was im uncomfortable and instead you said im too much of a chicken shit to talk about my valid concerns and feelings so im going to imply youre doing something bad and try to force your to justify and defend yourself instead of having an open conversation about your feelings too,MLeek
you probably dont mean to be gaslighting but is what youre getting at youre trying to obligate her to pretend youre being nice when you both know youre accusing her of wrongdoing,MLeek
what you need to do can do and should do is acknowledge youre not comfortable with this friendship that is valid that doesnt mean shes done any monstrously wrong it just means youre not comfortable and that can and should be addressed baseless shady accusations dressed up like their innocent questions  yeah that shit pisses people off,MLeek
this is already a breakup,MLeek
stop prolonging your suffering stick the break up and end all contact,MLeek
16 male and 19 female subjects,MLeek
that is not meaningful support for the idea they women can detect facial symmetry in body odour this is not how girls work not on the basis of this study,MLeek
oddly enough the thing that seems to be brushed right past here is that the strongest correlation in this 25yearold very small study was actually the men smelling the pretty ladies the smell of the women was rated by men as sexier the more attractive their faces these few men could sniff out a pretty face apparently the womens responses to the scent of the men were way more nuanced and less clear,MLeek
this would also require op actually talking about his actual feelings,MLeek
im concernedim feeling insecurei have questions about boundaries and not opening up with thinly veiled insults like so how close are you,MLeek
you need to trust me to select my own friends isnt a totally fair response to i feel insecure but its a totally valid response to baseless accusations especially if its the third or fourth time youve heard em,MLeek
you came to her with your concerns and she told you whats up,MLeek
keeping on coming at her with this over and over again is telling her that you think shes a liar and cannot be trusted to select her own friends or maintain boundaries with them,MLeek
if thats what you think of her dont date her,MLeek
if you want to talk about your feelings and have them acknowledged then go ahead and talk about your feelings a conversation about your feelings doesnt open with obvious judgement and accusatory language like how much do you two still talk and just how close are you two it starts with im feeling insecure about the level of contact im seeing can we talk about boundaries with this new friend and make sure were on the same page i need some reassurance if youre feeling vulnerable or concerned or would like different boundaries to be matinained say so talk about that but dont expect her to play conveniently stupid for you when she knows shes being directly insulted and judged not being asked to have a conversation about how youre feeling,MLeek
spoken like a person who has never once been at risk of being labelled that upright b who just cannot take a joke in the office,MLeek
there are reasons to let shit slide you dont have to agree with her choices but it can be extremely hard and risky for young women in workplaces to draw those boundaries we cannot afford to go around picking those fights needlessly with the rude men around us because there are real fights that are real risks that might need all our capital to address preferring to laugh it off is a perfectly normal response,MLeek
16 male and 19 female subjects,MLeek
haha yeah no,MLeek
it really only supports what we already know  women who are ovulating are more sensitive to body odour then women who are not a lot of women could have told you this themselves if youd bothered asking,MLeek
i think this is far too fast but that doesnt really matter very much,MLeek
whats the plan for the talk how do you imagine that conversation going with her are you trying to ask her if this is working for her are there things youre worried about for yourself youre not getting in this arrangement,MLeek
this probably wasnt about your erection,MLeek
it is exceedingly unlikely she thought about it a tenth as much as you are right now,MLeek
i know you dont want to believe that because youre feeling wounded and insecure but the worst thing you can do for your longterm happiness is let this anxiety fester youre never going to know for sure but it probably wasnt about that,MLeek
it was three weeks of a willtheywontthey between two longtime friends and she tapped out that was actually the most likely outcome regardless of what happened with your penis most of those connections fizzle out most of the time one or both people decide nope actually there is a reason were friends and not more,MLeek
youre never going to know for sure you probably wont believe her if she tells you but the facts are,MLeek
1 sometimes the body and brain arent in alignment and its rarely as big a deal for women as men assume it is its normal it happens it doesnt matter much the most annoying part about it for most women is that the guy gets really emotionally worked up about it,MLeek
2 very often the person we have romantic feelings for doesnt share them,MLeek
these two facts rarely have anything to do with one another,MLeek
you need to learn to say no fullsentence no excuses just no,MLeek
your mother can stand outside the door until your siblings let her in its important that you make your mother suffer under their bad behavior as well as she is the one with more power to actually correct it,MLeek
you also need to speak to your mother about some transparency into the household finances you are an adult and its not safe or responsible if she is the only one who knows how the lights get kept on what if something happens to her its way past time for her to share the budget and basic details with you if she expects you to keep contributing and living in this home as a 30 year old she might not be deliberately mistreating you but shes also not setting her adult children up for success by keeping them totally ignorant,MLeek
not your circus not your monkeys,MLeek
block him everywhere and move on with your life,MLeek
id just find it so immature that my adult partner was spending so much time pornscrolling on socials its not about trust or control its about wanting to to be dating an adult who doesnt sink hours of their day into mindlessly thirsting,MLeek
by all means enjoy consensually and ethically created porn but obsessively using ig that way is just so what a 12yearold in 2013 would do yuck,MLeek
hah my ex was the same way,MLeek
he ended it but clearly believed hed be able to bully me and watch me suffer because he made 23x more than me told me to my face that i had stalled his life and couldnt afford to live without him we were both a bit shocked to discover that i had significantly more money in savings his refusal to be transparent about finances was a huge part of the breakdown he liked to be the man who decided and who paid for everything and then hold it over my head that i wasnt contributing to the plans hed made alone,MLeek
immediately he decided i must have taken advantage of him  after years of refusing to talk about money with me as if i was an adult and a partner  instead of recognizing he had terrible habits he was hiding from me and i didnt benefit from in the least,MLeek
then im not sure why you asked if hes a potential rapist kinda six of one half a dozen of the other at that point isnt it not a question of is he violent just which kind of violence to classify it as in court,MLeek
yes you just had a man tell you hes a violent criminal in search of an excuse,MLeek
if he hasnt actually behaved like a violent criminal yet its only because he doesnt feel hes found a good enough excuse but hes definitely on the look out for one,MLeek
i made a similar choice my ex made it clear he didnt want an agreement he wanted to fight over every penny in court and there just werent enough pennys involved to bother extending his presence in my life even that much oddly the person who was most angry with my choice was my own father hes not a woke guy by any means but my dad was the one who felt most strongly that my ex has stolen my labour and dodged his responsibilities after 10 years together,MLeek
everyone says women go for every penny but i never met the woman who went to the mat for anything except the children in her care and even then i know a few who said it wasnt worth the drama,MLeek
its absolutely a thing people believe,MLeek
it doesnt matter how often you point out to them that divorce almost always leaves a woman less financially secure than marriage does especially if they have children,MLeek
the vast majority of women who choose divorce are choosing to be seriously poorer than they were before some of them know damn well theyre choosing poverty,MLeek
far too many men just cannot accept that poverty is better than living with them or but raising children is extremely expensive and yes it actually is still your job even when the mom stops fucking you if you dont like that take it up with capitalism not the custodial parent,MLeek
the simple argument is that the cats are going  thats the plan any disruption to their patterns right now just means its more likely the cats wont be successfully trapped relocated shes not getting rid of the cats by messing with the current situation  shes making it more likely theyll stick around after youre gone,MLeek
but she wont listen to reason,MLeek
more realistically you should just speak to your landlord and neighbours about someone else taking on the feeding you have other more pressing responsibilities to your own safety at the moment and eliza is far less likely to target the cats if they arent seen as yours,MLeek
if have a neighbour network and resources of support for these cats use it dont be a lonely saint let the village do what a village does and focus on what you need to do to get yourself a safe living environment,MLeek
let him know that youre not interested in datingseeing anyone else youre enjoying this connection and focused on it,MLeek
it is going to be a bit early for some people but you should always ask for what you need in any sort of relationship at any stage,MLeek
and its never too early to be honest about what choices youre making for yourself and to ask them what they thnk about that,MLeek
hes told you who he is,MLeek
youve told him you wont live with that person,MLeek
you are stuck until you decide your own future is more important than coasting and being comfortable with him right now a guy you cant ever live with,MLeek
if calling you slurs and keeping you feeling insecure in the relationship is a vital freedom he requires to express his true character then hes not the funny guy,MLeek
hes the guy who has learned how to mask his malice and contempt behind humour,MLeek
the one that is always stayed with me is from a long time ago i was about 19 i was riding public transit and there was a man who wouldnt stop talking to me and was trying to physically box me in i had moved seats twice and i was at the stage i was just trying to ignore him and was too scared hed follow me if i got off the bus which would be even worse than being on the bus where at least there were witnesses even if they were pretending not to notice,MLeek
i was seriously starting to panic when these two much much older ladies started shouting at me annie is that you come here and sit with us annie and demanded i take the seat between them they spent the next two or three stops winking at me and talking so loudly between the two of them about annie and how lovely it was to run into annie and how annie absolutely had to get off at their stop and have a cup of tea with them so i did and he slunk off and didnt follow us,MLeek
i think you have the right idea to focus on life stages thats the big gap between them and it wont disappear for nearly a decade,MLeek
you may also do what my mother did and remind  her its the fact she wonderful and mature that will make her an object of interest to men older than her including those are using her positive characteristics to mask their negative ones my mother was addressing a much larger and more obviously predatory age gap when she said that but it always stuck with me that she explained id be selected by this sort of older men because i was defensibly mature presenting not because i was naive because i was smart and wonderful not because i was a pushover because i was inexperienced not i was dumb,MLeek
in broad terms yes we could get more specific but youve basically got it,MLeek
we cannot always control what were attracted  too but we can control and challenge the false stories and stereotypes we believe about the kinds of individuals we find sexually appealing,MLeek
to get along with people you must remember theres a difference between a story or a fantasy or role that we might enjoy sexually and an actual unique individual person who may have a feature or characteristic we associate with that story in our heads,MLeek
dating involves a lot of rejection it just does but if you cant deal with the individual person in front of you and separate them from the sexual object fantasy in your head about petite women youre gonna get rejected a lot more,MLeek
yes basically honestly thats pretty impressive youve understood what people are telling you,MLeek
and its not a terrible problem a lot of us have stories about what we see attracted too that are flawed or fetishizing to some degree but it is an error and its not going to be fair to every individual woman and since you only date individual women you need to be aware of your biases and your stories and your illogical beliefs about women  and keep them under control  when you speak to individual women otherwise many of them wont like you or trust you,MLeek
if people feel that youre forcing them into a particular sexual role or dynamic just because you like their kind of body and associate it with your fetishizing a lot of people wont like that,MLeek
a preference for blond hair is different from preferring blonde hair because you thinks blondes are more carefree and fun the first is fine the second is a false story many blonde women will not enjoy having forced on them,MLeek
nope you got that backwards and its gonna get you into trouble youre fetishizing small women because youre attracted to a story about weakness and softness they arent inherently more feminine and therefor you are attracted to them you are attracted to them so you call them feminine,MLeek
a little more self awareness will help you with actual woman and not just chasing a fantasy fulfilment none of the women i know who youd call feminine would want anything to do with you if you cannot tell the difference between the story in your head about pretty little princess and the real full human being they actually are even when they wear pretty dresses,MLeek
id worry a bit less about being polite and focus a bit more on being clear being clear doesnt mean being mean the clear honest communication is that you reasonably believe she gave it to your brother because she decided she didnt like your choice  and is now purposefully lying to you about that which only deepens the violation and hurt dont ask her to do anything just say i know you did x i reasonably believe you did y and are lying about it now i am hurt and angry,MLeek
you dont have to not be angry or bitter this is a legitimate thing to be pissed about it does feel like crap nothing is going to make this better even getting the oil back from your brother is probably gonna feel like a rather empty victory,MLeek
you probably shouldnt go back to the good relationship that you felt you had right after you got back that was temporary and not fully true hell the fact it was good for a while may be why she felt she could get away with this violation relationships arent static but you should try to stop telling yourself the kind of stories that are going to make you angry for longer the fact you have some awesome travel stories is more valuable in the long term than the oil dont let your mother take even more away from you than the oil or poison other parts of your life and memories,MLeek
you offered to do this if you were anxious about the exchange you need to at least express that to him hes not wrong or evil to accept your offer of a favour at face value,MLeek
if you leave your partner thinking youre happy enough to do something for them your partner might just assume youre happy enough to do it,MLeek
if youre upset by a pattern of being inconsiderate or taking your assistance for granted then that is a thing to discuss with him but as youve written it here this is a bad example of anything besides him definitely not being a mindreader,MLeek
you cannot fix this for other people,MLeek
you can tell them kindly but firmly that youre drawing a boundary on these emails in your life and that includes even their responses to them you cannot let this harm in,MLeek
if they continue to respond to these chains youre going to need to block them too and theyll need to reach out via text message or phone call if they want to contact you,MLeek
tell them you absolutely respect their choice to engage and fight but this isnt the context in which you are willing to engage with your uncle or his ideas encourage them to take similar steps to protect themselves from harm if and when they deem it necessary,MLeek
direct conflict with this sort of person rarely works be empathetic with your family who is hurting but be clear about your own boundaries on these behaviours if you want these email chains out of your life get them out of your life,MLeek
technically possible but extremely almost absurdly unlikely like baby grand piano falling out of a passing plane overhead and crushing your mailbox unlikely all those things technically exist and so could possibly happen but almost certainly will not dont lose sleep this time,MLeek
please use another method if you dont want to be pregnant this is how you get pregnant,MLeek
its good that youve been able to improve your relationship with your mother but perhaps its time to also manage your expectations and your responses instead of trying to change her choices,MLeek
by all means tell her how her actions have impacted your and your relationship but expecting her to get the oil back is just a further escalation that is a unlikely to happen anyways and a bit unfair to the poor sod she dragged into this and b doesnt actually solve the problem,MLeek
tell her how the behaviour impacted you let her figure out what shes going to do about that likely nothing and allow this experience to inform your choices and boundaries in the future with her perhaps store the rest of the oil in your own space,MLeek
two things,MLeek
the first is that this is just called compatibility compatibility is difficult and rare its good that you are able to see the difference between valuing someone as a friend and wanting to pressure a romanticsexual connection thats a great thing a lot of people dont have figured out,MLeek
the second is to reconsider how much you engage with or centre your fetish in your life a lot of smaller women will not appreciate being fetishized like this in fact your attitudes towards them will make you incompatible with a fair number of them if youve ended up with a bit of a mental deathgrip syndrome where you are only sexually interested in one very particular kind of dynamic or body type then you probably want to try to expand your taste and stop hyperfocusing you have trained your body and mind to only respond to one thing as sexy and thats not necessarily gonna lead you to the most happiness,MLeek
youre 32 youve been sharing a home with this other adult for years you should absolutely expect your husbands support but not his blind service to personal boundaries that you will not even speak up about yourself,MLeek
it is hard i understand that but youre demanding work from your husband when you wont do your share you also owe it to your husband to also put the work in its not fair to make this emotional and interpersonal labour all his job to perform you make you both look foolish when youre not able to simply say bil this shoulder patting just doesnt work for me please dont do it flinching or shrugging is not sufficient communication,MLeek
have you expressed this to your brotherinlaw,MLeek
while i agree your husband should support you he shouldnt have to speak for you,MLeek
youre not mute youre not a confused child or any other sort of incompetence with this,MLeek
you should be able to say bil please dont do that i dont like it it doesnt make me feel the affection youre trying to express it just makes me uncomfortable,MLeek
then your husband should support you its shouldnt be all his job to express your boundaries to someone else anyone else,MLeek
they probably believed they were okay with it too they might still believe that they probably arent trying to lie to you but you have to make your choices based on whether or not what they do works for you as a partner not just what they believe  good luck,MLeek
professionals are just people even a pro quarterback making millions a year makes a few truly bad plays you can always be a bit skeptical of a single professionals opinion especially when its on someone who isnt even in the room,MLeek
you are poly and asexual your partner is not really okay with either of those things,MLeek
leaving aside the other behaviours  which all sound more immature to me than malicious  youre just fundamentally incompatible leaving the relationship would be wise,MLeek
based on what youve said here exceedingly unrealistic,MLeek
if your partner has behaviours or patterns that are making you uncomfortable discuss those with her,MLeek
and im concerned your therapist didnt correct their massive error prior to the end of the session seriously they set you off down a totally unproductive and even damaging path if i were you that is the relationship id be rethinking,MLeek
of course you told your therapist more than this,MLeek
but either your therapist is monstrously irresponsible or they were just a bit careless and didnt realize you were going to take way way more away from their comments than was halfway reasonable to do,MLeek
its reasonable to recognize that her pattern of withdrawing or going into negative moods for a few days might be who she is  and not just a trauma response to her past relationship it is not at all reasonable for either of you to be trying to diagnose her as a narcissist that is calling someone an irredeemable abuser and liar the fact you had no concerns prior to the conversation with your therapist and then jumped to labelling them with npd is absurdly paranoid and suggests to me you might struggle with anxiety its worth remembering even a healthy person can sometimes display some narcissistic traits but that is entirely different from having npd or being a narcissist anyone who saw me drunk at my 30th birthday party could have observed a solid few narcissistic traits,MLeek
to date is to risk being lied to either take the risk with open eyes or dont but dont fool yourself into thinking there is any perfect way to avoid manipulation in life there is not perfect system life is risk,MLeek
yeah do that take him seriously and make him explain what is funny about calling you an evil predatory person who wants to hurt sick people,MLeek
no sarcasm no bullshit take him dead seriously,MLeek
ouch thats hurtful,MLeek
im just joking,MLeek
its funny to call me an evil person who wants to hurt others,MLeek
no its not,MLeek
great then quit it,MLeek
if hes your friend hell take note if he wants to be a jealous jerk more than he values your friendship well youll find out,MLeek
your therapist sounds deeply irresponsible,MLeek
dont date someone you feel this insecure about dont date someone if you do not trust them do not date someone if you are not comfortable with how they handle their past experiences or conflict with you,MLeek
dont see a therapist who diagnoses someone who isnt even in the room based on the story you tell in a single session,MLeek
dont you go diagnosing someone via google,MLeek
no one knows if this woman is mentally ill or a narcissist based on what youve shared here if youre giving your gf leeway on behaviours you would rather not accept in a partner address that or end the relationship doesnt suit you,MLeek
you need to block her that is what no contact really means,MLeek
she is going to keep on circling back either out of boredom curiosity or a desire for attentionvalidation,MLeek
it is sad her cousin is in trouble but youre not her support network thats not a thing you can address youre an ex an ex who requested no contact youre not friends,MLeek
stop letting this person pick at your wounds for their own sake,MLeek
i can see youre really trying to come at this from a good and kind place but i think a bit of a reality check,MLeek
this is not just grief this is also a bad manager,MLeek
youre describing some very toxic management behaviours that were almost certainly present prior you were just in the first few months of a honeymoon period of a new gig and you hadnt seen your bosss weaknesses yet all bosses have some youre describing some particularly bad ones open contemptlack of respect focused on blaming not solutions isolating employees to retrain control emotionally manipulative,MLeek
and this is your managers fault and your managers managers fault if they need to take leave because they cannot perform and treating people with respect and managing communication with the team are performance issues for a manager then they need to actually take leave and the daytoday responsibilities need to be addressed by someone else,MLeek
there is not much you can do but recognize this this behaviour is not okay it may have escalated recently due to grief but it is probably not brand new if your company is at all healthy then your managers manager is aware of the performance issues doesnt mean theyll do anything about it but they likely know,MLeek
stop trying to figure out how to address your bosss feelings and start focusing on how to navigate your workplace and responsibilities from the perspective that you have a really shitty boss right now maybe they werent always shitty but id bet they always had these weaknesses and maybe they wont always be this way but right now they are your boss and they are really really bad at it the strategies you need to learn are how to work for a bad boss,MLeek
ditch him,MLeek
i dont fuck men who tell me they are skeptical about my gender identity or sexuality i used to try to be chill with the whole youre probably a lesbian really or i cannot believe youre really bi but no fuck that noise you can believe me when i speak if you dont we dont fuck,MLeek
oh maybe this is just a reading comprehension issue and not a legal theory one,MLeek
apparently not im not a lawyer either but i imagine any actual legal training might even get in the way of said knowledge,MLeek
youre a lawyer,MLeek
its shitty to have sex in your own living room while your roommate is also passed out in said living room but its not banging on a swing set behind the grade school,MLeek
itd be funny to hear the talking to op would get if they actually called 911 because they woke up a few feet from their roommate hooking up,MLeek
she shouldnt be including people in her kink without their consent and if you want a no sex in common area rule then just speak up and say so its a totally reasonable rule ive always explicitly had it with all my roommates no sex in shared areas like living roomsbathrooms,MLeek
if she wont agree to that reasonable rule then youre going to need to move,MLeek
but realize the rule is not really all that enforceable rule if your style as roommate includes getting so drunk that you regularly pass out in common areas she is still in the wrong but i think you should bring your anger down several notches tell her what you need to be comfortable in the shared area of the home and for the sake of the friendship file this under a misunderstanding of one another boundaries,MLeek
leaving your wife of 17 years with two kids involved probably gonna require a conversation,MLeek
i cant confront her about it because it would reveal that i checked her phone which would be a huge breach of trust that could ruin our relationship,MLeek
op said he risked his marriage he should know,MLeek
piling on her is some self righteous fun times for internet randos but shes not here op is op needs to talk to his damn wife,MLeek
if youre ready to walk away from this relationship then walk,MLeek
trying to force his parents not to invite her to easter was foolish at the very least trying to change his mothers traditions for who she includes at family dinners was out of line and plainly stupid of you you picked a very specific fight  with his mother through him  which you were not going to win if you were serious about not attending with her then the actual boundary was just to let him know to send you regrets to his mothers and that youd be spending the holiday with your own family not to try to change the invite list thats not a boundary thats just being bratty and pushy with your bf of three months family that so was not a smart move,MLeek
but besides that your bf has been clear about his priorities and the boundaries he wants with her and they dont meet your needs stop fighting a war youve already lost and in the future dont try to pick fights with mothers over the guests they frequently invite into their own homes,MLeek
a half a year of a break is just a breakup a chickenshit slowmoving break up,MLeek
he may not have been trying to fuck with your brain but he certainly didnt give a rats ass if he did at some point there is not much difference between this level of childish stupidity and selfishness and malice,MLeek
block him everywhere hes trash and youre good to be rid of him,MLeek
dude youre almost 30 so yeah wise up love is not enough,MLeek
for a single parent you also need to be compatible with the child and the family life the parent wants for the child your anxiety with the child and with her coparent after nine months of dating was a pretty reasonable dealbreaker for her to have it doesnt matter if the kid loves you the sorts of thoughts you were describing having about the child and the ex were toxic af,MLeek
youre not compatible,MLeek
you should probably avoid dating single parents its okay to not be good at it but its important to know that about yourself,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
this was my thought and i felt a bit bad about it this woman is gorgeous and has beautiful breasts they would probably change drastically if she tried to loose enough weight for a flat tummy look,MLeek
when i have less of a pouch i also have far less tits i like my stomach the most at about 135 lbs but i love my tits at 160 lbs,MLeek
this would be a reaching a dealbreaker for me,MLeek
my ex did this too compared me to toxic and abusive women he knew or had heard of when i expressed totally reasonable boundaries or feelings i sat quietly trying to talk to him about money while he compared me to a woman who had stabbed her husband talked to him about how he had insulted and undermined me in front of others and he compared me to a woman who had driven her husbands car into a tree to punish him,MLeek
i honestly didnt realize until that relationship was over how totally absurd this behavior was it was emotionally abusive and a silencing tactic basically anything i thought or felt that was inconvenient for him was crazy or toxic there was no way for me to say anything he didnt like without being treated like a potentially violent lunatic the issue wasnt how i said it the issue was he never ever want to have to listen to it,MLeek
realistically if youve checked out of the relationship then youre almost certainly going to end up leaving and taking goober thats just the most likely outcome of what youve described here no matter how much you say you cannot do that,MLeek
you do all the animal caretaking this relationship is going to end and youre going to end up taking the dog because youre the one whose life accommodates the dogs daily needs that is almost certainly what is going to happen the faster you and your bf admit to yourselves the better off all three of you will be,MLeek
if you want to be sneaky about it start paying for all the vet care and dog food having the receipts will be a good idea if your bf tries to challenge the reality of this situation when you inevitably break up,MLeek
some people are really bad at making choices or expressing those choices clearly to others for lots of reasons,MLeek
most people are not consciously stringing anyone along they just dont know what they dont know they tell you the best truth theyve got at the time its on you to walk away if a relationship of any kind its not meeting your needs,MLeek
this isnt about women or even really all that much about dating you can have totally similar communication issues and indecision dynamics with coworkers friends or family members,MLeek
this is an advice sub so the advice is dating is hard most connections will not go anywhere women are human dont become bitter and resentful about women just because youre inclined to date human women,MLeek
i cant imagine i would either but nothing about any of this gets addressed here until op talks to his damn wife,MLeek
youve been advised to speak to your wife,MLeek
youve been advised to stop this risky pinning for other womens attention and validation,MLeek
youve been advised to increase your therapy sessions,MLeek
take this over to rventing if you just need to type out your troubles over and over again youve been given all the sensible advice a person can get there is no magical answer that the internet is withholding from you the answer you dont like is the only answer,MLeek
there is no way forward without revealing you checked her phone admitting wrongdoing aand asking her the questions that frighten you and dealing with the consequences you know it could be just friendly i use it with my sisters because we blow kisses all the time you also know it probably isnt just friendly and that at very least its a behaviour youre uncomfortable with,MLeek
sorry but im not buying your minimization here you know this snopping risks your marriage you have done this before and you will do it again this was not a onceoff youre checking up on her by violating her privacy thats the marriage youre in right now this is the marriage youre going to be in until you make different choices,MLeek
play stupid  games win stupid  prizes,MLeek
your current plan is gradeschoollevel shadethrowing youre a 40yearold guy with two kids do better talk to your wife,MLeek
wildly,MLeek
the cdc puts it at like 4363 for womenmen so 44x more whod have thought the cdc would be fooled,MLeek
him and several other people not just the two of them,MLeek
pretty standard practice for young academics at conferences i snuck six of in once because money is tight and conferences are vital,MLeek
exactly this,MLeek
lob this grenade back into their home and tell them to sort their own shit and leave you out of it youre not the other woman in their shitty little drama,MLeek
shes not the villain but she is treating op like shit because she cannot stand up for herself that is manipulative and childish,MLeek
she probably should feel insecure but that doesnt make it ops job to protect her from the reality of the man shes planning to marry,MLeek
i wouldnt do it quite like this if op further enmeshes themselves and opens up the risk of debatenegotiation with a timeline threat if op is going to show mark the letter better to just do the thing rip the bandaid right off,MLeek
if op has an email for them both cc them both on the same email thank her for her message and say you absolutely understand her feelings and agree with her you absolutely will respect her wishes and not attend the wedding however you also will not lie to mark about the reason you are declining the invite,MLeek
and ask them to kindly not involve you further in any disagreement,MLeek
where did they fuck,MLeek
he kissed her once and op ended contact for months because it wasnt what she wanted at all,MLeek
ill agree op isnt blameless but at this point shes just an inflatable bat these two morons are hitting each other with she didnt cause that mark and his fiance are telling this little drama tale and cast her in this bullshit role,MLeek
it doesnt matter how wellwritten it is,MLeek
what happened here is that this woman put op in an impossible position where no matter what op does she has to be the bad guy either she lies to a friend or she shows up when she knows shes uninvited all because this engaged woman cannot speak transparently and honestly with her fiance its manipulative bullshit being earnest about your manipulation and dishonesty doesnt change the core of the behaviour,MLeek
if it were me id be livid with both of these people for putting me in this situation and send a photo of the letter to them both tell them of course i will not attend and to sort their shit out without involving me further,MLeek
this friendship with mark is probably over because they are both a shitshow you should be opting out of anyways,MLeek
you dont go you tell him youre absolutely 100 not going to go you understand her reasons and you agree with her that its best you dont attend,MLeek
and you show him the letter,MLeek
its not okay for her to keep these secrets or burden you with them your loyalty is not to her its to him dont go to the wedding regardless tell him as much because of course you shouldnt go if the bride doesnt want you there but also dont let her turn you into her own dirty little secret thats not what you are you are his friend so you show him the letter,MLeek
shes not protecting mark shes protecting herself she figured out a power to move to absolve herself and make you the bad guy no matter what you choose so choose friendship give him the truth wish him well stay the hell away from his wedding,MLeek
i get missing that but really that should be resolvable by ya know i miss that every once and a while you damn better get outta bed and come down the hall for fun times,MLeek
again i get being nervous about how this might change your patterns and dynamic but put your big girl pants on this is part of what getting older together looks like sort your shit out and stop talking about divorcing your husband because you might not be able to share a bed every night you must realize that is not the place to start this problem solving effort,MLeek
you really cannot wrap your brain around having spontaneous sex but not in the hour right before you two go to bed,MLeek
its not really that spontaneous if its only happening in the bedroom during the eveningnight is it thats sure not what spontaneous sex means to me,MLeek
youre 44 i get being nervous about this change but give your head a damn shake this is should be a fun problem to solve,MLeek
youre not crazy,MLeek
by all means wish the best for him,MLeek
but also stop talking to him,MLeek
take the win enjoy that final pleasant conversation and dont leave the door open to anymore more bullshit because as much as you may wish better for him its pretty damn unlikely hes any better yet if you let him back in even just a catchup occasionally odd are its not gonna keep on feeling that good,MLeek
show kindness to yourself let go of the anger and of all contact youve gotten everything you need from this person already,MLeek
experience of life matters,MLeek
which is why he knows to keep his distance from any woman who has any,MLeek
youre kidding yourself,MLeek
like i understand why i know why youre going to keep trying to negotiate this but you are kidding yourself he is not ignorant he is skilled he may not be selfaware about it but he is skilled,MLeek
he has a set of interpersonal tactics that work for him he has found that you are respective to these tactics when others would have reasonably cut off contact by now,MLeek
in every one of your responses you are describing a person with tactics to make you feel obligated to him and to be constantly extending the benefit of the doubt to him he violates your boundaries and then blames you for hurting his feelings because you didnt appreciate having your boundaries violated,MLeek
he may not be fully conscious about what he is doing but he is fully aware of what works to make young women feel pressured to keep being nice to him when he is not being nice at all,MLeek
you need to crush this guy for your own sake and his,MLeek
he absolutely sees the gift as niceness coins that can he can use to make you feel obligated to give him what he wants or tolerate his other poor behaviours,MLeek
stop assuming he doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing,MLeek
youre dating someone who lies to you and is comfortable being with someone who is cheating on their wife,MLeek
your skill is not the problem here blow jobs are not the problem here this is not a religious hangup your gf is dishonest,MLeek
how many times have you asked about this situation now im sure ive see it six or seen times so is it a dozen twenty times now,MLeek
this is really not a healthy use of rrelationships at this point,MLeek
youre not comfortable with this fwb arrangement if you were comfortable with it you wouldnt be posting repeatedly online looking for some sort of magical insight that is just not coming stop doing something youre not comfortable with or secure in if its fueling these sorts of questions and anxiety just stop,MLeek
take your larger questions about life and relationships to a therapist and maybe stick to a vibrator for a while until youve got a better sense of your own desires and boundaries when it comes to others,MLeek
lets be fair a silent bang maid he can verbally abuse without feedback or consequence,MLeek
micah struck me from the get go as a situational mean girl still nasty as all hell but probably capable of selfcorrection if she made the active choice to break with her toxic friends and end those patterns shes a notverybright follower and people pleaser easily led happy to earn brownie points with the even nastier girls by playing the same game shes got no core not a lot actually going on,MLeek
my youngest sister was like this as well she was a nasty piece of work with her tribe but she woke up the the dynamic when she was in her mid20s and decided to stop acting like a damn hyena got a few new friends and decided to try being basically decent to other people for a while,MLeek
micah is extremely immature for her age and i sure as shit wouldnt want to be her friend but i have some hope for her all the same,MLeek
she may have thought you were joking your reaction was that ridiculous,MLeek
sometimes youre owed a swift kick in the ass dude and not a gentle pat on the head she should never have had to hold your hand through this,MLeek
this is not a bid for connection,MLeek
leave her be,MLeek
yeah i do think you can cultivate real friendships with men but its particularly tough at your age and its rare overall men are so encouraged to shoot their shot and see every woman in their life as a potential girlfriend if they are just persistent enough some never get past that nonsense assumption about the availability of women to their desiresneeds but some do,MLeek
trouble is ya just never know which is which until you know,MLeek
youre being absurd you utterly overreacted to her acting like a decent host,MLeek
demanding an apology from him because she allowed him to use a room in her apartment to take an important call is the worst kind of toxic machismo bullshit youre basically broadcasting to him that you cannot handle his presence in her life and dragging him into your argument with her by taking that stand not okay your sense of possession of her space and the desire to pick a fight with him over this are huge red flags,MLeek
its not our space her space for a damn work call he needed a space apart from the group to take its not like she was giving him a lap dance while it happened or tossing her panties at him he needed a door that closed in most peoples apartments that is only the bedroom,MLeek
if i was your gf id be frustrated with you too and resentful of your inability to manage your own feeling for a hot second and respect a perfectly reasonable decision if hes her friend then he is a friend she behaved like youd expect someone to for a friend,MLeek
you were way off base you didnt need to be further heard you needed to get a grip,MLeek
if youre not okay with her being friends with a past partner say that but if youre going to accept that this person is a friend then she gets to treat him like a friend,MLeek
right there are a lot of not great options  because the whole thing is just not great  and there are some very bad options stalling until you are vacationing and putting it out there without warning is in my opinion a very bad option,MLeek
exactly,MLeek
and the goal here should be to rip it off before you reach peak misery and you snap and do it a totally thoughtless and likely antagonistic way,MLeek
its never going to be not complicated the goal should just be to make the pain and confusion a little bit more manageable for you both,MLeek
exactly it is stressful its not gonna be less stressful if you do it while in an unknown place where you have no separate corners to go to take a time out and you still have to figure out where the food is and what time you need to get to the airport it may suck to do on a weeknight but being on a trip is not gonna make this more successful unless shes agreed to use the time that way as well,MLeek
you realize your behaviour here is weird right,MLeek
you keep responding with what you dont want but are extremely vague on what you do want in this connection and what you are or are not getting from it you keep coldly reporting his situation and status in a way that sort of sounds like a list of grievances with him but you seem to refuse that framing as well its bizarre,MLeek
if youre not comfortable with the fwb arrangement with him end it youre not his therapist or his support you dont have to be that to him just because you feel he is in need of it,MLeek
if you want to date someone else do so your current list of other potentials is beside the point entirely if this fwb isnt working end it even if you dont have other great options at the moment youll live,MLeek
or maybe you really just need a vibrator for a while,MLeek
i just told you im a rando online that is all i am to you thats all any of us are on reddit to you any other qualifications i might have in other aspects of my life do not apply to this exchange,MLeek
im glad youre talking to your therapist about this and obviously their advice should trump randos online bit i do think that is bat shit crazy,MLeek
your wife is going to feel entrapped and set up and neither of you will be able to retreat if you need too on the receiving end itll seem like you did all this work just to corner her into a really tough conversation personally i just cannot imagine a worse way to approach this than not to tell someone youre only taking them out of their space and routine so you can tell them youre miserable in the marriage,MLeek
at least give her some warning that you want to have some serious conversations and reconnections during this trip let her walk into it with some informed consent,MLeek
i know this is harsh but once a month is a vent session or maybe a way to address a distant issue like parental alienation or largely resolved past trauma this is the marriage youre in every day if youre not going once a week youre not going to see much progress on these sorts of issues,MLeek
there is no right moment you have to make a good enough moment before you snap and the moment becomes to urgent to avoid and it probably goes very badly,MLeek
and the good enough moment is not while travelling do not spring this on her for the first time while travelling that is an truly awful idea that will only further unbalance you both she will feel set up and she wont be wrong if this is part of your motive with all these plans you are setting her up all your work to create a gift or a meaningful time together will be spoiled if you leverage those possible moments of reconnection to instead trigger what you reasonably realize will be some conflect and youre setting yourself up for disappointment and epic failure with that plan travelling will not be the removal of barriers to this conversation it will be the removal of normalcy and safety and disruption of the patterns that actually allow for calm reconnection and thoughtfulness travelling is not the circumstances to have a difficult risky conversation within,MLeek
i cannot say this clearly enough that is a terrible plan please do not do that unless she has consented to some sort of couples retreat where she knows that conversation is a priority for this time do not do that,MLeek
therapy,MLeek
you need to speak to your wife and advocate for your own relationship that isnt rocket science but if your own insecurities and fears are further muddying these waters go talk to someone and get a bit more clarity to help you through these tough conversations,MLeek
looking for validation outside of your marriage is an understandable impulse but you need to quash it and address the issues inside the marriage first and no i dont mean to just keep addressing them through further acts of service for your wife i mean addressing the fact that you are also a person with needs and feelings within the relationship and speaking up about the kind of marriage youd like build together,MLeek
if you want to apologize apologize just apologize,MLeek
what you should not do is demand more of her attention and emotional service to hear you out or patch things up if you want to apologize and admit wrongdoing then do just that and nothing else youre not entitled to trying to fix it you dont get to control her story about her own life all you can offer her fairly without her asking for more is a hundred words or so admitting you were wrong and that you understand that you hurt her and that you are sorry,MLeek
if its more than about 100 words youre doing apologies wrong,MLeek
so no bullshit about your growth and maturity or anger issues treatment thats not her job to address or validate just i was wrong i hurt you i am sorry,MLeek
if you want to try and rebuild a connection id strongly encourage you to speak to a therapist before you take any steps towards that if you want to apologize then just apologize without demands or expectations or excuses,MLeek
im not able to say much because youre saying a whole lot of nothing what is your actual question youre just spinning yarns over and over again,MLeek
what is the choice youre trying to make right now,MLeek
then what the hell are you saying what is this all about what is the question here what are you not getting that you want,MLeek
you can date other people if you want to date other people right what are you looking to hear by posting over and over again on reddit,MLeek
i understand being concerned but he told you unequivocally to back off so you back off,MLeek
you keep asking about this situation but you never mention what you want or what youre comfortable with,MLeek
why are you working so hard to comfort this man and get all wound up about his choices why trying to read his mind why talking to her why stay in something that is so messy and hard,MLeek
if you dont want to be his fwb just say so,MLeek
youre not his therapist its okay to not want to give the kind of emotional support hes looking for but you need to be honest about it stop beating around the bush you dont need advice you need to get your own head on straight and set some boundaries or end a connection that isnt working for you,MLeek
youre not his therapist and as his exgirlfriend you are very limited in your role as friend as well,MLeek
he hasnt changed this about his own situation for a long time its not likely hell change it now its more likely that his comment was an attempt to get you to change back and to frighten you back into the role of supporting him the relationship as it was was working for him,MLeek
you cant save him from his own choices or his depression and trying to do so will so will probably just keep you locked in the dynamic,MLeek
you need to let it be a break up,MLeek
absolutely if theyre getting pressure from other people to include children when they dont want to those are the people who are burdening them youre just seeking and clarity on a decision theyve already made as long as when you talk to them youre clear that your first plan is to follow the only information you have directly from them which is not to bring the children then youre golden they can either politely confirm that or they can say that no they really did mean to make an exception and id like to have you all there,MLeek
in your position id ask my husband to call a couple and tell them that hell be attending and that you will be sending your very best and staying at home with the small children asked if that sounds good with them and if it does problem solved the answer to anyone after that is just we spoke to the bride and groom and we will come to a plan that works well,MLeek
if a couple says they absolutely want you there and are happy to have the small children there for a little while then you kind of hooped and rejecting the invite outright would be rude,MLeek
this isnt fatherinlaws call to make and anyone who wants to show off the grandbabies can do that on their own time not hijacking someone elses wedding,MLeek
what do the couple want what is their preference,MLeek
i dont think youre totally out of line but weddings are the kind of thing sort of thing you do need to suck it up for all this is sorta the point if the couple themselves would like you there as well as your husband and that the children are welcome for a short time yes you should probably put in the work to make that happen,MLeek
if its your husband and his parents puttering around and making plans behind the couples back then your husband should call a couple and ask them exactly what theyd prefer and clarify the invite,MLeek
youll probably get better advice from other trans women but your approach seems needlessly dangerous to me,MLeek
and im not sure why this is on your mind if youre in a relationship thats been exclusive for two years now whats up with that,MLeek
he drunk texts you so no,MLeek
you might be just looking for platonic friends but a guy who mostly texts you drunk is a shady one not friend material,MLeek
sounds like the two of you skipped some really important conversations and have been playing it by ear when it comes to money you need to quit that even if you make more than her the mental load of finical planning shouldnt lie entirely with you you two need to sit down and deal with the reality of what you actually have to meet all of your commitments and long term goals,MLeek
your boyfriend doesnt trust you select your own friends and is passing judgment on you based on feeling someone else had about you when you were like 17,MLeek
if hes going to behave like that you cannot fix it for him and you probably shouldnt date someone who refuses to believe you when you speak,MLeek
expect to be believed and trusted when you say a onesided high school crush wasnt a major event in your life  and you dont appreciate your bf trying to turn it into one now,MLeek
how old are you,MLeek
i only had one true male friend in my 20s and he was also the husband of a close friend,MLeek
i think men generally take a longer time to learn how to be just friends what they actually want in a partner as opposed to a good friend and stop seeing every woman they know as a potential its not entirely their fault they get told a lot more stories about winning a woman over with persistence than they do about just really valuing a womans friendship,MLeek
i now have a few dear male friends but they really didnt appear until my mid to late 30s,MLeek
he has clearly got other issues with this friend and his gfs choices that hes masking its hard to give much advice if he wont admit there is way more going on inside his head than some sort of personal rule about vacations,MLeek
ah lucky you  so its not that,MLeek
if we accept that the fundamental job of being an adolescentteen is to achieve autonomy from your parents pivot to peers and enhance your own emotional skills and selfregulation and that there is a kind of progress through somewhat standard developmental stages while they do that then interruption just means what it means ya got interrupted at times by calamity or neglect or accidents and thats not you being broken or even mentally ill necessarily thats how human children respond to those situations  they cannot learn certain ageappropriate lessons in that situation so you probably have some catch up to do in some areas that lots of other people progressed through at younger ages,MLeek
thatd be my take anyways just from my own experience in therapy,MLeek
id also say i think its pretty normal for your first few sessions to feel like everything is broken and youre a hopeless mess and to be exhausted and overwhelmed ive got in and out of therapy a few times in my life and i always have to brace myself for those first few weeks no matter how happy i am with the match of therapist its a slog,MLeek
by no means trying to minimize your experiences or effortless glowup but did it suddenly get warmer where you live,MLeek
i dont get approached all that much but i would say 50 of what i get takes place in the first 2 really sunny weeks where we put the parkas away everyone is just cheerful and looking to connect just a theory,MLeek
once more dont work yourself up into a snit because other people arent following your script,MLeek
and dont come to advice sub if all you want is validation for your own interpretation of a personal experience advice is a thing you can take or leave very similar in that way to the feedback you receive when being rejected,MLeek
dude find some grace,MLeek
as another soul blessed earlier than most with a secure attachment style and some selfknowledge get the hell out of your own skull and realize not everyone is fucking with you,MLeek
mostly they are just figuring their own shit out andor not that into you,MLeek
find some of the chill you claim to have and let people be people messy complicated confused people youll have your days too and youll be happier if you assume confusion and disinterest and misunderstanding  not malice dont work yourself up into a snit cause other people arent following your scripts,MLeek
bisexuals have a harder time dating lesbians than lesbians do this is a pretty well understood phenomenon and a lot of lesbians wont date bisexual woman at all its certainly easier to get a date with a straight man but that is a numbers game more than a reflection on men or women there are just way more single dudes looking to date and who will date a bisexual woman then there are bisexual womanlesbians looking to or open to date bisexual woman even just demographically speaking,MLeek
its totally bit of mythology that ted bundy seduced his victims the first people he seduced were all the professional white dudes in psychiatry and policing and journalism who though he looked just like one of them,MLeek
bundy hunted constantly he broke into homes and killed women while they slept he pretended to be disabled and in need of help they women he killed didnt fall for him or date him or love him he fooled other men and became a celebrity target for some mentally ill women when incarcerated but he didnt seduce women he viewed them as objects to possess and was remorseless seduction was never his game with his victims his charm was reserved for the men who saw themselves in him,MLeek
exactly i have a few men in my life who are criers and its lovely and connecting im so grateful for them sharing vulnerability is a beautiful thing but the last time i had a guy wail at me about respecting his tears he was trauma dumping and trying to turn the conversation about his bad feelings when i really needed to address his bad actions,MLeek
he was shocked and claimed sexism when i said i am glad you feel poorly about your behaviour i think you should im not able to comfort you right now i am legitimately very angry with you and am going to take some distance,MLeek
this exactly im a bisexual woman and to be the pursuer is to be rejected 19 times out of 20 or better thats the situation even if you are thoughtful and picky about where you put your energy with straight men you get the doublewhammy of those who are just not interested and those who absolutely cannot handle assertive women and its not like they wear labels a lot of guys think they want to be pursued or propositioned or seduced until it actually happens and they either arent in the individual woman or are just deeply uncomfortable with the dynamic,MLeek
in the end i just had to admit i didnt want to be with a man who couldnt handle me expressing my interest clearly anyway and roll with those punches,MLeek
straight up my sewing machine takes way more technical skill and knowledge to maintain and repair than my gaming laptop,MLeek
id like to see this dude even manage to thread an overlocker,MLeek
sesh whose gonna tell him that the pretty cashier is also only just pretending to give a damn if he had a nice day or not and might even cash out black men and wish them a nice day those lying lawbreakers,MLeek
and she gets to be annoyed with you and doubtful of you,MLeek
you can keep repeating yourself if youd like but im gonna stop now,MLeek
tell yourself whatever story you want about your own motivations your gf is perfectly reasonable to be both annoyed with you and skeptical of you,MLeek
you can dig your heels and get your way probably but her feelings are understandable and valid and it doesnt reflect great on you that you cannot be pleasant to her friend and colleague from work over a drink or two  holiday or no,MLeek
thats not selfish that is you be a competent adult,MLeek
date another competent adult,MLeek
drinks with a local friend is usually a great idea while on holiday,MLeek
unless it would take some massive investment of time or money in order to meet up with this friend it sounds like youre being petty and insecure,MLeek
the real question here is are you comfortable with the friends with benefit role youve accepted with this man which includes this level of emotional labour and intimacy,MLeek
friends with benefit arrangements come in lots of shapes and styles we cannot read his mind any better than you can but this questions suggests you have concerns about what youve agreed too with him and what youve being involved in,MLeek
its totally fair to be hurt it probably would be wise to ask her about it,MLeek
asking her does risk more pain but not knowing it likely worse by admitting youre hurt you give her a chance to acknowledge you even if shed have made different choices and at least youll better understand,MLeek
its not a fight theres nothing to fight about she cant make it not hurt you and you cant change her mind its probably gonna suck just try to understand one another,MLeek
great then you know that youre not his clinician and you know to stop rehearsing this fight with an imaginary version of him in your own head or working yourself into a snit with your own assumptions and actually express your own totally valid concerns and needs without the harsh judgments of his character and current choices thats the next step good luck,MLeek
you didnt answer any of my questions leads me to think that no you havent spoken up at all so thats a lot of lecturing directed at a random persons online with a lot of conclusions already drawn about his character and mental health all seemingly without any substantial conversation with him you must see thats rather toxic behaviour on your part to have your mind so made up about him without ever asking or listening to him on the subject,MLeek
check yourself put on your big girl pants be transparent about your needs and expectations but enter this important conversation with a tad more respect for differences than this youre trying to be partner youre not qualified to be his therapist and its not fair to toss these labels at him the first time youre clearly communicating your unhappy with his choices,MLeek
have you been this frank with him have you spelled out your expectations around meals and how much time youre willing to spend with his family,MLeek
also why are you framing this as a dependancy instead of a choice you say his parents arent demanding of this so your fianc is making a clear choice for himself and not even necessarily an unhealthy one just one you would like to see changed,MLeek
you dont have to be perfect to deserve basic respect and civility,MLeek
hes much too old to be treating other people like this dont date a man who cannot spend 20 mins in pleasant conversation with family members you value and be on time for a meal when he is guest,MLeek
always its been weeks thats not always that a significant amount of the time shes known him,MLeek
the forced timeline is doing them both a even bigger disservice than the others accountability cant be rushed like this bliss has totally reasonable feelings and fears that are going to keep cropping up for a while even if she is doing all the work she can to move past them forgiveness is rarely a light switch even when both people genuinely want it to be and forgiveness doesnt mean you magically feel good or the pain is erased and fully healed forgiveness is often given while were still hurting you cant punch someone in the face on tuesday apologize and tell them its in the past at lunch on wednesday while the bruise is still swelling they are going to legitimately say just because i forgive you doesnt mean there isnt still a pain,MLeek
nothing about this changes my advice and it doesnt reflect the respect you say you have,MLeek
youve shared your opinion that is what you get the risks are all hers the choice is hers shes made it you respect it or you gfto,MLeek
its not about you as a guy its about her interpersonal risk management,MLeek
there is a fine line between him being upset that he is missing out which is reasonable and him trying to throw shade or punish you for going,MLeek
the next time he makes a comment that stings say so ouch that hurts it feels like im being punished and thats not fair see if he can be accountable and own his own shit or if he doublesdown on blaming you for his own bad feelings,MLeek
sure its possible,MLeek
doesnt mean youre required to find it acceptable doesnt make him any less shitty doesnt mean youre in a secure and healthy relationship,MLeek
it doesnt make it better him being that stupid and shallow doesnt mean youre required to get over it,MLeek
youre making and allowing a lot of excuses for him bottom line for me would be if he actually is that stupid ignorant and careless with other women while also betraying his gf then i wouldnt date him if all your excuses are true you still shouldnt date him thats too dumb to date,MLeek
your boyfriend has a madonnawhore complex he is not interested in fixing inside himself,MLeek
if your not his perfect wifey madonna then youre trash,MLeek
this is a very distinct issue from not caring for tattoos people can not much like tattoos without comparing women with them to porn stars or saying shame things like wives dont have tattoos,MLeek
you got the ick because he treated some women as for sex and other women as for wifey and naturally many woman enjoy both and those roles are not defined by tattoos,MLeek
dont marry a man who can only see a woman worth on the basis of her body if you do you live with the constant risk of him deciding youre not wifey but trash and nothing you say or do will change his mind also youre likely not to have a very good sex life if he has decided its other kids of woman who are for sex and not you a man who categorizes women that way is not a safe partner,MLeek
you should respect her comfort level and choice on how to manage this shes the one who had to absorb all risks and consequences for any steps she takes next not you and probably not even him,MLeek
so if she says its not worth it then its not worth it to her end of story,MLeek
she handled it appropriately at the time and kept herself safe that is what matters most,MLeek
its bad enough he bullied her this way the whole thing just gets worse if you make it all about your feelings and opinions and try to bully her into a confrontation with him she doesnt want because your ego was bruised that someone did this to your girl,MLeek
back off she says its handled then its handled,MLeek
sleep is a vital part of human health and sanity,MLeek
your fianc needs to moderate his expectations and think of others ways to address any needs he has for intimacy cuddle while you are watching a movie or listening to a podcast or something for a bit before bed kick off the covers and cuddle for a bit in the morning more hugs and touches though out the everyday activities maybe sleeping time is for sleep,MLeek
hes the one ruining your relationship if he doesnt do that work to moderate himself and respect you,MLeek
you cant comprise your sleep itll literally destroy you and eventually your marriage,MLeek
dont marry him until he addresses this behaviour hes too old not to know better,MLeek
this is my thing the timeline pressure here is what is totally unreasonable in this case i mean unreasonable timelines are sorta the name of the game but still,MLeek
it forces them both to rush through the accountability stage straight into the honeymoon while also sorta robbing bliss of that honeymoon mexico time i worry the pressure of the show will leave zack thinking his mistake is just in the past when its totally and very literally still present in the context of the damn show and it will be for a long time even if he and bliss are great together,MLeek
im not in the us either but okay,MLeek
36 hours is a range in which you need to manage yourself far better than this she may be disinterested and that is frustrating but one good date isnt a contract for ceaseless attention and communication,MLeek
youre aware us a holiday weekend and many people will be with family right on top of normal adult obligations,MLeek
lots of people do ghost after first dates and it sucks but your expectations for contact are excessive its barely been 12 hours get a grip,MLeek
you just met this woman her world doesnt revolve around you suggest a second date for sometime next week if thats what you want to see happen your anxiety is going to be your own worse enemy in this case and any other,MLeek
this isnt a relationship question,MLeek
forcing strangers and customer service reps to participate in your kink in however a small way is unethical,MLeek
figure your shit out and keep private cashiers arent be paid enough for whatever nonsense youre up too,MLeek
if you dont wish to be housewife dont marry this guy,MLeek
he wants a housewife and he is willing to bully and manipulate in order to get it,MLeek
ive had one stubborn dark hair on my chin since puberty and another joined in my mid30s,MLeek
never heard suggested its any sort of problem or concern mostly just trad barbs with my partner over it and his stray nose hairs,MLeek
my grandmother sexist as hell in her own right and shamelessly favouring her boys said maybe this man every single time,MLeek
my youngest sister is 13 years younger than me and let me tell you i really expected the comments to be even worse,MLeek
some of the stuff i heard from people who assumed she was my child including from adult woman would make you vomit,MLeek
it was upsetting to the point my mother started to avoid me being left alone in public spaces with my littlest sister,MLeek
solving a problem responsibly and making healthy choices for yourself is an attractive quality in a grown up,MLeek
these are your insecurities thats okay you came by them honestly but dont force them into the mouths of the people who care for you,MLeek
eh reddit skews young and youll get a lot of responses from teenagers and young 20s somethings who are still all up in their own childhood trauma and teenage resentments this is much more of an adult 3040s sort of relationship management question i think it takes a bit more distance to see something like this more clearly,MLeek
however valid annes anger or boundaries are she doesnt get to require you to punish beth for her for the rest of beths life that is not a reasonable expectation of you youre entitled to attempt to form your own adult relationship with beth independent of anne and of your parents,MLeek
my parents have failed both daughters in every possible way,MLeek
this its this this is the problem and you cannot solve it for the rest of them your parents created all of these monsters and continue to support and feed the beasts they will not be slain by you alone,MLeek
the only thing you can do is the thing you have done included beth in your own conception of your own family it might now work out but only by doing the work to create a connection there yourself just between you two will you learn what beth is actually capable of and might want in her connections with family members ignore annes bullying remain polite as you can be as you either accept or decline invitations from anne largely you should decline to speak to anne about beth or beth about anne,MLeek
you may also consider inviting your parents andor beth to your place at any time you know anne is busy with her inlaws or is away on vacation or the link that is a bit underhanded but it will minimize her fits and when she complains about the distance when you next invite her you can remind her how unhappy she seemed to be when you invited your parents while she was busy,MLeek
if your niece is small try to maintain contact with her on holidays by sending a card or small gift even if youre not going to attend its good to maintain that holiday connection with a small child in this situation even as you need to balance other obligations and events,MLeek
end contact,MLeek
religating the break up is petty and counterproductive youre going to have to live with and learn from your own regret of not breaking up with him sooner when you should have because he was mean,MLeek
you cannot control the story he tells himself just stop listening to it by ending all contact with him,MLeek
if there are laws in your country that preventing you from working without your parents consent then youd probably benefit way more from local advice most users on rrelationships are americans or from other very western societies,MLeek
what is it your mother wants you to do in the next few years if she doesnt want you to work do you age out of the law at some point are allowed to work without her permission,MLeek
the fight about who talks longer is a distraction,MLeek
the fight you need to have is the one where you tell him his actions do not reflect respect or that he values what you to say he is expressing frustration that he doesnt know what is up with you but he is also sending you silencing messages when you try to communicate,MLeek
communication doesnt just mean you trying harder to be heard by him or adapting yourself so you can somehow get through to him it must also include him making real effort to listen and understand and yes that does take work work you are naturally putting in when he speaks work he has probably does naturally with nearly everyone else in his life that he values work he also has to put in to listening and understanding you,MLeek
youre never going to prove to him something he doesnt want to believe because it doesnt reflect the story and the role hes assigned to you challenege the story head on the story of my partner doesnt have meaingful things to say or if she just said it the way i wanted to hear it id listen,MLeek
it may be time to state clearly that the story needs to change and the behavior needs to change or the partnership will have to change in response,MLeek
that is pretty extreme i always think its fun to tell them toronto is slightly bigger than chicago which both have about the same population as brooklyn and watch them recalculate i never mind people not knowing that relative size stuff but the electricity and igloos things bug me tho,MLeek
i give your sealioning a solid b,MLeek
transparent and a bit of a slip admitting that you werent asking in good faith to begin with but still a wellexecuted online rhetorical maneuver that will fool some readers,MLeek
why on earth would i talk to you after that closing comment seriously use your head thats not how we express honest curiosity or ask for favours,MLeek
read through the rest of this thread for specific examples of normalized nudity and toplessness or use google i dont service the curiosity of people who speak to me that way it doesnt suggest good faith engagement at all and im not here to address your personal life experience,MLeek
youd be shocked by the number of americans who have asked me about igloos and sled dogs when tell them im canadian and no only a few of them were joking,MLeek
i can see new york state from my house on most days but they act like i live on a different planet,MLeek
closure is bullshit,MLeek
closure is what you find and create for yourself when you let go of what no longer serves you or what is unkowable it rarely if ever comes through conversations with others,MLeek
this isnt about andrew the person anymore this is about andrew the bad mental habit you break this habit with the same sort of strategies youd use to stop picking your nose or biting your nails use unpleasant interruptions to those thoughts and willpower,MLeek
recognize this is really about ego and about the story in your head and about the fact that no person with one life to live can follow all paths not about the man,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
stop acting like its that simple and safe to stand up for yourself in every context,MLeek
women are not magically born knowing how to deal perfectly with these bullies but we learn quickly there can be consequences to ourselves for telling them off in class or in the workplace like murder murder is an actual risk for a woman if she chooses to tell him off pick the wrong guy and you can be shamed at school or work suffer harassment for years or possibly even get killed,MLeek
stop expecting women to roll those dice each time someone is rude to her in a way them in a way that hurts the bfs fee fees,MLeek
its normal,MLeek
if youre not comfortable dont go over on hot days,MLeek
do not try to educate them they are not savages or ignorant youre the one here is who isnt progressive and if you are an american its a good moment to learn that what you think is leftist or progressive is the states is still pretty damn rightleaning in most of the rest of the developed world obamas policies were centreright on a global scale rarely left of centre by most other places standards american politics have been dragged so far to the extreme right that what you think is insanely progressive barely scratches the surface in most places,MLeek
but this doesnt even necessarily exist on a political spectrum for them its simply normal in a lot of places,MLeek
youre the one who has been misinformed by a culture that views womens bodies are inherently sexual and prioritizes performative modesty over womens actual comfort,MLeek
youre 16 youre describing dating youre describing a normal failure rate for dating you go out you mostly dont vibe the vast vast vast majority doesnt get past the talkingfirst date stage thats dating,MLeek
youre also describing a rather normal amount of selfcentredness for most teenagers,MLeek
youve had maybe two years behind you where you were capable of doing anything like actually dating another human being you have like 60 ahead of you relax,MLeek
youre not a narcissist if you were you wouldnt worry about this and youd easily fool people into thinking you were kind and empathetic to get your way the fact you are aware of this and concerned by it probably means youre not quite as bad as you think you are,MLeek
practice active listening and consideration with other people in your life recognize that a huge part of your overtalking is probably your nerves dont get so wound up about dates i like to think of a first date as a predate its a meeting where we both decide if we even want to have an actual date if im really nervous i even think of a few questions i can ask the other person to get them talking about their interests for a bit,MLeek
youre honestly doing just fine the worst thing you can do is get all up in your own head about your own perceived terrible flaws at the age of 16 they become selffulfilling prophecies your experiences sound well within the normal and you should have some learning to do everyone does at 16 let the rest of this bs go,MLeek
this im also a nonamerican who has dated in the us,MLeek
i may be compatible with a uk or canadian moderate  because in most other places moderate includes some basic social supports and some degree of abortion access  but i wont risk it with an american one american moderates arent moderate at best they just dont give a fuck,MLeek
come on youre 30 give yourself a swift kick you knew it was relevant,MLeek
it was emotionally relevant for both of you you kept context from him that a rational person could have assumed hed like to have you left him feeling played him for a fool so as to avoid feeling embarrassed and vulnerable yourself,MLeek
its easy to say you dont owe anyone the details and thats technically true but if you want to build a serious connection with someone then trust doesnt work on technicalities anymore,MLeek
you dodged a conversation that you should have as a rational adult realized may have been important to a serious partner maybe you didnt want it to me important mahybe you were worried they would put too much or the wrong kind of importance on it but clearly was important enough to you that you were motivated to avoid it and took the risk away by keeping him in the dark that wasnt considerate of his feelings it wasnt very fair to either of you,MLeek
if his response hurt you by all means say so,MLeek
but also recognize your choice to withhold this information however much it was technically your right to do so probably also hurt him thats valid too a reasonable person could have assumed this was information hed rather have than not have as a person who cares for you and want to build a mutually enjoyable and honest romantic and sexual relationship with you,MLeek
i think all manipulatorsabusers have something they can point to and say see all i do for you which often completely divorced from your actual desires or needs,MLeek
for my ex is was picking up the cheque at restaurants regardless of whether or not i have liked to stay in to eat me paying would have been emasculating of course but as the relationship began to end i was magically transformed into the bitch who never paid and i dont have savings because of your expectations,MLeek
im sorry youre going through this,MLeek
i know there often isnt much to do except ride it out and not provide any feedback at all to these screams for your attention cause thats all the insults are he knows hes been cut just wants whatever validation he can squeeze out of you by compelling a reaction,MLeek
ignore and document all you can at this stage really,MLeek
do you have some close friends you can talk to about it its helpful to have someone to workshop all those clever responses you can never send i think like how gross it is he wanted to fuck someone with the intellect of a small child,MLeek
dont date such a lousy mental health counsellor,MLeek
or at least dont be reliant on someone who is not on time for your ride to work,MLeek
communication comes in a lot of forms your bf does need to extend you some trust when you decide not to make an issue of a feeling youre experiencing,MLeek
and nonverbal cues are not bad lots of nonverbal communication is positive and helps to maintain connections between people nonverbal communication is harmful when its misinterpreted or when there is too much or too little of it,MLeek
what is definitely bad for relationships is defensiveness and blameshifting,MLeek
after three years together why are you suddenly concerned that someone might harass you,MLeek
age gaps have risks and struggles less so as you enter your 30s but still its been three years why is this question on your brain and coming out to a bunch of randoms online now,MLeek
this is probably not a great example of the problematic dynamic you are experiencing with your mother you were joking and she joked reasonably back ya dont get to pick your baby,MLeek
you might want to talk to a therapist if you find yourself dissatisfied with your relationship with your mother or frequently seeking validation where there is none to be had and there never really has been,MLeek
i would have a hard boundary on being spoken to this way as well,MLeek
i also wouldnt want to stay with someone who snapped at me while i was driving or pressured me to drive more aggressively than i was comfortable with that would also be a super firm boundary for me like i might have pulled the car over if you had done that to me i do not like that i would not tolerate that in a relationship sometimes we run late in life we handle our anxiety about being late better than that you did need to be told to stop that,MLeek
he didnt express his frustration well  but neither did you  and he had damn good reason to be frustrated with you by the end of this and then you jerked him around at the end again with the ill walkno i need you,MLeek
next youd be wise to book an uber,MLeek
your own boundary was completely valid your own behaviour was not,MLeek
she is not holding a gun to your head shes crying,MLeek
let her cry let her pout let everyone else treat her like the damn fool she is and ignore anyone who doesnt have that much sense,MLeek
shes not forcing you youve just decided you rather be her prisoner and give up what you want on your day than see her sad,MLeek
pick another dayevent to wear her dress and tell her if she cannot truly behave herself at your damn wedding she can sit at home and you wont wear it at all,MLeek
it is baffling to me how many of them can simultaneously argue men are violent brainless sex monsters and also inherently more logical and designed for leadership,MLeek
tell me you think that 26 salad buys you sex without telling me you think that 26 salad buys you sex,MLeek
you can stop this youre just not,MLeek
youre clinging to the story of a relationship that didnt even work out when you were 17 years old it when life is the simplest,MLeek
its easy to romanticize the past and to keep revisiting it in your mind whenever life gets scarry or sad its harder to face the reality of a future that doesnt include the dreams you dreamt at 15,MLeek
tell him if he really wants to work on this to take his commitmentphobic ass to therapy and do that damn work himself,MLeek
if he doesnt do at least that you should look into what it will cost to breaktransfer this lease,MLeek
there is nothing you can do to fix this for him its not about how pretty you look or how nice your nails are frankly its probably a lot about him avoiding the work of being in a relationship and pushing all the work onto you by creating emotional threats in the relationship that you feel you must respond too,MLeek
if he doesnt want to break up he needs to go do the work to fix this for himself and for the relationship if he wont be rid of him,MLeek
this is going to hurt his feelings if the positions were reversed it would hurts yours this just a hurtful reality its no ones fault but it is painful,MLeek
its not overstepping to express to him that there are things youd really like to do together walking going to shows that his weight is making more difficult its not overstepping to tell him youd really be happy if he would participate in the weight loss with you,MLeek
focus on the activities you want to share dont mention appearance dont mention other people he probably will because that is where the shame hits hardest stay focused on the quality of the time you two can share together,MLeek
this is grief its okay grieving is exactly what is happening right now,MLeek
block andy everywhere,MLeek
the only thing you need to consider in the near future is how youre going to address your parents part in this because this issue actually wasnt ever between you and andy it was between you and your parents and andy and your parents but your parents foisted it onto you they should never had said to talk to you about the value of the honda they should have said the honda was giving to her outright so its not ours anymore she doesnt owe you half of it and that is exactly what you should have said as well when andy asked they gave it us outright its not theirs anymore so its not half yours if you feel mom and dad owe you something or have agreed to help you get a car talk to them,MLeek
your parents chickened out and left you holding the bag for their choices with their unstable son and you all failed to be totally clear with him because you were fearful of him responding irrationally you can see where that got you all in the end,MLeek
show them what was postedtexted to you explain you are currently going no contact with andy and that is nonnegotiable let them do with that information what they will hopefully they will recognize they made mistakes that contributed to andys confusion and angry irrational as it may be dont expect them to stay nocontact with him for long they probably give right in to whatever his demands are you stay out of it,MLeek
thats unfortuante but again i have been abundantly clear with you,MLeek
unless my partner told me very clearly that the package needed to be signed for or handed to an actual person for the delivery to be competedly which is functionally the same thing here i would not open that door i would assume the package would be left and we could grab it in a minute,MLeek
youve asked a question you clearly dont like my answer and thats fine you probably should try to form the question about your relationship which is the actual issue here,MLeek
im done repeating myself good luck with it,MLeek
yes i would not open the door for a package that was going to be set down and left i would wait a few minutes and then stand up and get it i would not open my door to a stranger not even one i may reasonably assume was a delivery person i would not let an unexpected knocking person even know i was home if i could help it,MLeek
whats the actual issue here cause its clearly not the package,MLeek
dude i was super clear unless my partner had very specifically said it need to be signed for if it was just a package id assume it would be set down and wed grab it in a min without me opening the door for unknown person,MLeek
you got relationship issues communication issues consideration and respect issues ask about those actual issues you asked about opening the door and i answered with plenty of particulars and caveats there is a logic to not answering the door that might or might not apply here,MLeek
i wouldnt have answered the door in that situation unless my partner had very very specifically told me a package needed to be signed for otherwise id expect theyd set it down and wed grab it in a few mins,MLeek
doesnt matter what uniform they are wearing unless i know youre coming and why i dont open the door for you this means i also dont stand up and look through the peep hold alerting you to the fact im home period its not an unreasonable boundary for a person to have in life depending on where they live or have lived in the past most women i know operate in some sort of similar way,MLeek
she may have been inconsiderate in this particular situation but in general her behaviour is within the range of normal,MLeek
there isnt much to do it feels insufficient because you cannot actually control her all you can do is starve her of all attention and dram to the best of your ability,MLeek
you block her everywhere neither of you ever respond again you keep records of her behaviour in case you need to get the police involved,MLeek
you can both also consider warning your workplace or boss that you have an ex harassing you personally i think its good to get out in front of this in the workplace and ask people to be cautious giving out your information or location,MLeek
you need to trust your friends and network to not support this harassment talk to one or two of your closest friends about the harassment and dont skimp on the word harassment and let them know you are asking all your friends to keep information about your relationship and your wedding private so as not to expose you to further abuse,MLeek
anyone who doesnt completely agree with that should be uninvited but you dont have to deal with that right away right now you just have to lay down the law absolutely zero reply or contact with your ex from you and your fiance records for the police requests to friends to not share any information that could empower the abuser,MLeek
you cannot communicate yourself out of someone elses choice,MLeek
you cry yourself to sleep on the regular because he chooses to behave in ways that are at least inconsiderate if not downright cruel,MLeek
nothing you do is gonna magically change him youve been clear hes been consistent this tactic works for him hes sticking to it,MLeek
date the man he has shown you very clearly he intends to continue to be or dont date him at all,MLeek
tell him the truth you dont want to date him,MLeek
you dont think youre compataible you have very different approaches to dating and building romantic connections,MLeek
dating is always a risk if you dont think this guy is a risk worth taking for you personally be honest and upfront about that it might seem mean but really its the kindest thing you can do is be clear and honest,MLeek
even if you do decide to date your favourite restaurant on your birthday is a lot of pressure to put on yourself go get a damn coffee on a tuesday and keep expectations and pacing managed,MLeek
keep your distance,MLeek
if they ask give them a clear no thank you dont make excuses dont be overly grateful or flattered dont compliment them or try to build them back up dont explain why dont say you dont date coworkers unless you are serious about never dating a coworker ever dont try to protect their feelings too much because that will only make you unclear and leave them with confusion or false hope,MLeek
be clear to be kind,MLeek
if they pull vague shit on you like maybe we could be clear that sounds like a bit like a date and i dont want to go on a date,MLeek
it feels rude it feels mean only because women are trained to be terrified of rejecting men and to never bruise their egos buts not rude or mean its the kindest thing you can do to cut through the awkwardness as quickly as possible,MLeek
i wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who spoke to me like that,MLeek
i also wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who was always planning for the worstcase scenario was chronically overthinking or made me feel unsafe,MLeek
neither of you comes off smelling like roses here both of you probably have work to do you need to figure out if its work youre gonna do together or not,MLeek
reality check fathers who ask for custody is court get it almost always they basically have to be drugaddicted and homeless before the court will take away all access and even then some sort of visitation would be likely,MLeek
custody is unbalanced because men dont seek it  because so many couples default to the idea that the woman has primary or sole custody  and so many men are unwilling to make the adjustments to their lives to have actual physical custody on a regular basis,MLeek
by your description your husband will have little trouble getting shared custody it will just take time to work through the system,MLeek
in the meantime you need to regulate your emotions a bit better get some support and spend some time with your family or friends get some space from this ongoing crisis its slowmoving by design and that sucks but thats the reality find some peace on the path,MLeek
stick with the cbt hes not gone for ever that is a nightmare youre cooking up in your head that is exactly the kind of irrational thinking your cbt should be helping you to manage,MLeek
masturbation is healthy communication about sex is healthy,MLeek
there is no issue here,MLeek
if youre uncomfortable hearing about it ask him to keep this subject private that is all,MLeek
feel however you feel but recognize he is doing nothing wrong and this has nothing to do with you you could be having vaginal intercourse every day of the week and he still might masturbate sometimes its perfectly healthy,MLeek
i think she is rather strong and secure she is totally right the closure is largely myth and that kwame keeping circling back to micah is completely bullshit,MLeek
the trouble with chelsea is that she is putting all her energy into someone who doesnt want what she wants right now thats gonna make anyone look needy and demanding she thinks if they work hard enough they can make it work its not the worst approach but its also not true,MLeek
not a red flag just a bad choice,MLeek
nothing about this seems at all unusual,MLeek
noncreepy men exist,MLeek
there is nothing to process they had a friendly lunch,MLeek
it sounds like youre just not compatible and its time to end this connection,MLeek
youll meet lots of people you vibe with and can have fun dates with but who just dont fit as serious partners,MLeek
dont get angry about it just accept it and let go of what doesnt work,MLeek
it seems unlikely that your parents are truly worse than your boyfriend,MLeek
they at least realized you need a job if you ever have a hope of escaping this predator,MLeek
call a domestic abuse hotline and ask for help youre in danger you may not want to go home but you cannot stay where you are,MLeek
i feel like this is saying a lot more about the comparative funding of public transit,MLeek
ugh that does make it way harder,MLeek
id still stick with the friendly lies my friend had similar hair to yours and she went crazy for this stuff dads gonna grab some for you to try make sure you really work it in there with your nails and tell me how it goes,MLeek
but ya really gotta keep your goals small offer everything is an offer you have to not get invested in whether or not she takes you up on them discipline and hygiene are the parents job regardless of whether or not your dad feels comfortable with it big sisters just offer with open hands,MLeek
fair point op grace is old enough to visit you without the rest of the family can you make that work,MLeek
go slow pick your battles based on how receptive your think shell be id start here,MLeek
i think i can help you get your hair looking cleaner would you like that,MLeek
leave your dad out of it as much as you can dont let your sister know youve been talking about her behind her back if she says yes you pick the products and you sit her back over a sink like they do at the salon,MLeek
if you can get over that hurtle then you tell a little lie ya know when i was a teen and my body changed i had a hard time with body odour too can i tell ya how i learned to deal with it,MLeek
sadly none of this should be done unless she says yes if this becomes a discipline issue it will just have to be your dads job your role is only as an advisor and advise requires her being consenting and open youre not the boss of her youre a person with just a bit more information than her who may have some good ideas to offer,MLeek
youre a good sister go slow really really slow small steps tackle the easiest stuff first leave things like nails and skin care to end  if every  since those will feel the most like youre trying to change who she is focus on growing up healthy not appearance,MLeek
play stupid games win stupid prizes,MLeek
if you pull that stunt expect it to be the beginning of the end youll be in race to be the bottom to see who can be less interested,MLeek
look its been 14 dates if you want something other than what you have with this man ask for it talk about timelines and expectations openly right now you both sound be assuming the other person is also dating other people,MLeek
if you want something other than that its time to say so,MLeek
if she doesnt say that then she isnt singlaing she wants more frequent contact if she does say that she might simply want more time with her friends after her breakup  many people do,MLeek
like i said sooner rather than later youre gonna have to take the risk and communicate clearly and it may not go well for you thats life,MLeek
what do you need i have a few hours on x day no pressure but is there anything i can do for you or would you like to just hang out for a bit im just thinking of you today and sending comforting vibes no worries if you dont respond i know youre busy im just offering anything i can,MLeek
it is repetitive memes can be good for breaking up messages of supportaffection,MLeek
reiterate that you dont need a response dont get bent outta shape if you dont get one let them off the hook explicitly,MLeek
if she suggests concretely doing something in the near future would be the most clear sign not a vague we should do this again but a concrete i want to do x with you lets pick a time,MLeek
no perfect clues obviously at some point youll have to risk rejection but that would be clearest sign she isnt just looking to catch up and then talk again in a few months,MLeek
okayyou dont like her choices youre just not compatible,MLeek
listing your grievances real or imagined isnt going to change my advice,MLeek
youre not compatible,MLeek
and your insecurities may make you toxic as all hell if you dont get a grip on them there is a very real risk with this attitude that no one will ever be pure enough for you you seem to be looking for reasons to think less of them and to minimize the connection you have if you have a pattern of losing respect and affection for women because they are relatively normal human beings with full lives and dont commit to you with their hearts before they commit to you with their actual words then you need to reexamine yourself,MLeek
but that doesnt make you and her compatible youre simply not so stop now,MLeek
you do nothing more than text occasionally like an actual friend for two weeks,MLeek
this is in a conversation you will best judge in person see how the catch up goes dont develop an agenda beyond being her friend and being willing to be transparent about your feelings of she appears open that conversation,MLeek
dont try to jump the queue women are not vending machines we dont just take the next guy in line the moment were single,MLeek
thats kinda my point,MLeek
if youre communicating that unclearly in the heat of frustration even while taking the time to type and post to a bunch of random people online who can barely follow your story and understand the real issues in the hopes of giving you advice one might suspect you are also not communicating very clearly with your wife when the feelings are really intense and you actually give a damn about what she thinks,MLeek
this isnt rventing this is for advice for advice to work we have to be able to understand one another,MLeek
couples counselling i dont know if this marriage can or should survive but i know if this is how you communicate under stress nothing is gonna get better,MLeek
youre trickling out information very randomly you said i skipped a chore due to lack of sex but then you totally didnt cause its her chore 90 of the time,MLeek
these two things arent really related they arent the problem here,MLeek
if your communication with your wife is half as bad as it is here and you have any hope of continuing this marriage go see a couples counsellor and get some tips and tactics cause shesh  whatever her struggles maybe   youre not painting a picture of yourself as someone who is easy to understand and place confidence in,MLeek
your replies here are very strange,MLeek
this might boil down to dont be in a marriage you dont want to be in,MLeek
if you were actually trying to punish her  if you skipped getting medications she thought you would get without telling her  then you were engaging in abuse outright deliberate act of abuse of your partner,MLeek
if you genuinely forgot that is something different,MLeek
the lack of sex should have nothing nothing at all to with you communicating clearly whether or not you were able to pick up necessary medications on time  these are not related issues,MLeek
you need mental health support this is above the pay grade for rando advice online,MLeek
we cannot tell you if youre relationship is abusive based on what youve shared here you may have reasons for concern but you havent expressed those reasons here,MLeek
what i can tell you is that the story youre telling right now about this event doesnt line up with the reaction and fears youre expressing the two things arent in sync that doesnt mean your reaction isnt normal but it does mean you havent been able to line up your feelings and your words with your reality describing it as cuddling but then checking carefully for bruising just doesnt make rational sense one of those two things is not reflecting reality,MLeek
take those questions to a pro,MLeek
was there a reason you set this boundary in the first place has he tried to choke you previously are there are other behaviors he engages in that you think might be abusive as well do you have some past trauma that can help you understand why you reacted the way you did,MLeek
attempts at choking are absolutely abusive and are the kind of abuse that is likely to escalate,MLeek
it doesnt appear here that either of you believed there was any intent to choke you it seems that you both understand that a boundary was violated accidentally or do you think someone else happened here besides that,MLeek
i think youd benefit from getting some mental health support your reaction doesnt quite make sense in the context youve provided here you could use some more support and a place to talk through the full details of what happened and what you thought about it,MLeek
stick to your no it is sad but your answer was the right one editing services are professional services professionals are trained and they get paid your father is asking your dedicated many hours to someone hes treating as a hobby if he is not willing to pay for those professional services,MLeek
and its not your hobby,MLeek
if it was a profession hed be at least trying to engage and step up to paying a professional editor and it sounds like hes not pleasant for an editor to work with is he,MLeek
youre 22 your focus should be on your own path forward not on the potential family income from the book sales tell him you just cant commit the kind of time hes looking for and dont have the skills he needs to elevate his work let him pout it out,MLeek
rachel renee russell makes very literally millions of dollars a year her daughter minored majored and education and minored in fine arts at the university of michigan she is being compensated for professional services shes not supporting her mothers hobby for shits and giggles and thank yous,MLeek
yes shes an adult you must tell her,MLeek
if shes concerned there has been an error that might be additionally stressful for her tell her what you did so she can plan appropriately,MLeek
hey i didnt want this to confuse or worry you but i wanted to give you this gift at this difficult time and i added 1000 to your account with your case worker,MLeek
they know they know why they are unsafe he at least doesnt care being a safe respectful place for you is not something he values explaining will not make him care it will only make you more vulnerable to his bad behaviour dont do that definitely dont do it yet,MLeek
just tell your mother the hard facts of what is going to happen next you will not be in his company again from here on out you will not speak to him or see him you do not want an apology you want zero contact with him you are cutting him out of your life entirely she is welcome in your life only if she respects that he is not be clear if that includes not talking about him his opinions or any of her issues with him if this means only seeingvisiting her outside of their shared home say so be brutally clear,MLeek
this should really not be neogiatable hes out neither he nor she is to ask about him being let back in if you ever feel ready to tolerate his presence again in any way you can initiate that conversation if they try to pressure you hang up leave walk away its not a conversation you will consent to be a part of,MLeek
if your mother cannot respect those terms go extremely low contact until she realizes its that or nothing,MLeek
you are not a bad person this is clearly a situation where you have to put your own oxygen mask on first you cannot help your mother right now with her relationship,MLeek
no one is only awful to their female partners,MLeek
a person who can betray in that context will betray in others,MLeek
generally speaking if there is a risk of physical unsafety i think you have a responsibility to either tell the other person or to end all contact with the person who is harming them,MLeek
i wouldnt stand by and watch my friend punch his gf i wont stand by and watch him betray her sexually either if you really cannot tell her then the least you can do is draw firm boundaries and let him know he can no longer confide in you how he harming her,MLeek
well then tell jake that you know my bf ryan lives there and well probably see him in the evenings a few times,MLeek
assuming you actually want to go with jake,MLeek
just say no i mean it doesnt sound like you want too anyways  there has been a misunderstanding and it might not be malicious you travel frequently to x to see your boyfriend if you go youll be spending a fair bit of time with your bf if jake is welcome then say that but be clear your bf lives there and would be a priority for any visit you made,MLeek
its that simple dont try to read jakes mind or defend any feelings youre assuming he has just tell him plainly what the deal is,MLeek
its always valid for people to invite who they wanna invite and lots of people dont like hanging out with couples but its obviously silly to go to where your bf lives and expect to not include him in at least most activities,MLeek
it sounds like youre making a bigger deal of this than you need too,MLeek
it your partner feels they are missing something of great value in your shared sex life its on them to bring that up openly and respectfully stop twisting yourself into knots to provide something hes not even asking for,MLeek
you dont find pleasure in it makes sense you dont have a prostate,MLeek
if you dont want to do it dont stop assuming its a such a big deal for him when hes not even expressing that,MLeek
your emotions are interfering and that is a thing you can talk about but it does mean the way youre currently engaging in the friendship isnt working for you youre gonna have to think about what you need to do differently to allow this to be just a friendship and to kill the inappropriate expectations you have of him as just a friend,MLeek
that probably means contact needs to be reduced for a while and you need to quit the social media stalking behaviors that are upsetting you,MLeek
hes not your bf youre not in the kind of relationship where its appropriate to ask him to moderate his behavior like that,MLeek
think about the boundaries you need to have for yourself do you need to stop following him in ig for a while do you need to admit youre not actually friends because your feelings run too deep for that,MLeek
you can end a friendship if it leaves you feeling conflicted and unhappy,MLeek
doing this without her consent is disgusting no pass on that youre not a child that is knowable that was not okay what if a coworker or friend saw it thought she was cheating on her husband or that you had an open marriage give your head a shake youre not this stupid,MLeek
but no the fact that realizing her attractiveness to other people made you more attractive to you is rather shallow but perfectly human basically the entire physiological core behind kinks like hotwifing and cuckolding,MLeek
what you need to learn how to do is find your eurake moments without acting like a little shit first,MLeek
i think you need to accept he doesnt want to understand it,MLeek
the problem isnt with your communication there isnt some perfect way you can phrase this to make him get the message his current comfort is dependent on him not getting the message if he got the message he wouldnt get what he wants so he wont,MLeek
he is not confused respect me as an equal and a partner when it comes to money matters and household chore division is not that hard or complicated hes choosing not to listen to you when you say things he doesnt like,MLeek
100 this is totally me man have reason you lady have feelings me right you wrong,MLeek
i hope op can move pass the gaslighting and misplaced empathy to the boundaries and gtfo stage of this,MLeek
how the hell did you end up living with someone who refuses to communicate with you about money or about division of labour that stonewalling shit is absolutely misogynistic thats not a feels,MLeek
thats a reality of a man who thinks the big calls are his to make and yours to live with,MLeek
you cant make it right,MLeek
you made a choice that choice had consequences,MLeek
you can and should apologize and admit wrong going without any excuse then leave him alone hes made his call his call was clear and reasonable,MLeek
sometimes you just dont get to make it right the wrong stands all you can is be better next time,MLeek
pets dont come into a home without all the adults in that household being fully onboard,MLeek
there is no such thing as a pet that has zero impact on the other person,MLeek
if youre not comfortable being the back up caregiver for a snake no snake full stop,MLeek
i mean its a views and followers economy and apologies are good content why wouldnt they post apologies,MLeek
oh hes just a chicken shit a gameplaying chicken shit,MLeek
telling you would have felt awkward and vulnerable so he didnt talking about your past sex life was way more fun,MLeek
and thats the best case scenario you know exactly what the worst case is,MLeek
reconsider being his friend he wasnt prepared to treat you like one,MLeek
really cause it seems like hes the one still at the teat here,MLeek
im sorry but that was extremely conveniently naive of you,MLeek
hes fine with his mothers behaviour because it means he doesnt have to be accountable to her or to you financially hes comfortable with the trade off of her behaviour for her cash,MLeek
thats not gonna change either live with it or escape it,MLeek
yeah bf sounds like a little shit who is happy to let mommy and gf fight it out passive aggressively because neither of them are willing to point at him and say you youre being a shit,MLeek
if parenting is important to you consider now what your options are for doing it alone you may not have any but the women i know who started thinking that way at 30 basically designed their lives around it were well equipped for single motherhood before 40 and are blissfully happy so if parenthood is a goal consider what that goals looks like without a partner,MLeek
as for the dating dont sweat it dating it hard in someways its harder when youre older but thats only because you have less time for bullshit and a richer fuller life there are plenty of men who will want you in your 30s plus a good chunk of 22 year old guys too seriously that part is a bit weird,MLeek
your husband is getting rightly railed for basically wanting you to be lesser than again and to centre himself in the marriage however here are a few slightly valid points that might be buried beneath his ego,MLeek
the home space become a work space is disruptive and blurs the line between working time and together time you are subsidizing your work with your shared home thats a real thing that is happening and has to be acknowledged openly,MLeek
it is more volatile you could start loosing money and quickly and have to be difficult to admit it to yourself its very easy for a personal business to turn into a loosing bet you cannot let go of,MLeek
however both of these issues can and should be addressed through open communication and balance not by putting his foot down like a stubborn toddler as if hes actually has control like that,MLeek
id recommend marriage counselling the answer right now from you should be along the lines of i hear youre seriously unhappy but i will not be ordered around like a child this conversation will be ongoing and for now i will continue as i am because its providing well for us all and its the best use i see for my time come to counselling with me and we can discuss what the future looks like in a respectful way,MLeek
honestly not much imo i dont know many people who had kids in their 20s on purpose excepting those who choose lifetime secure careers with powerful unions and good pensions its almost like economic security really helps,MLeek
the risks exists for both men and women but for people in their 30s they remain pretty negligible its all just the same shit weve been doing for decades shaming women for making choices that make them feel secure and empowered treating parenting as part hobby part biological obligation or even a punishment instead of a serious and very important bit of work that people who want to sign up for should be empowered and supported,MLeek
its okay to be hurt and disappointed but confrontation doesnt seem helpful to anyone here least of all yourself,MLeek
plan a visit to see to them and bring a premade meal or some such choreeasing gift some moms are up and active two months in many are still healing and not on anything like a schedule yet,MLeek
every single bit of this is a bf problem not a mother problem,MLeek
your 32yearold boyfriend has not prioritized or apparently shared his plan with you for paying down his education debt,MLeek
your bf has watched as your savings dwindled throughout this relationship without comment or concern it seeems,MLeek
your bf has not spoken with you to create a realistic and responsible plan for the future,MLeek
your bf accepted money first towards his downpayment then told his mom she couldnt live there,MLeek
the mother isnt a problem really shes not she might not like you much she may be toxic or abusive in other ways but that isnt the issue here on the loan the issue is your bf is not transparent with you about money and doesnt have an acceptable plan he can articulate to you about his debt,MLeek
i doubt he really plans to pay it all back to be honest id bet hes just accepted this holding pattern of lowkey abuse until she dies or becomes incapacitated,MLeek
nah marshall needs to be the fixer and chelsea needs to be the decider but chelsea doesnt really need to be fixed and marshall communicates his own choices for himself so clearly and rationally that hed frustrate her,MLeek
if they both got their own shit a bit better under control maybe but right this moment no they dont offer the other enough fuel,MLeek
100 brunette was clearly queen bee and knew it and was running circles round both shelby and micah,MLeek
micah is a gretchen wieners in constant search of her regina george literally the nicest thing i can say about her,MLeek
both of her friends were clearly jealous if not of the engagement then of the reality tv gig at least,MLeek
the thing they have is just standard toxic enmeshment shelby is getting the headlines for her drunken mess but i really felt she was just the meat shield  micayla was the queen bee and she knew exactly what she was up to spinning shit up and giving all those compliments to micah that were not really compliments and all had  at the end of them micayla knew how to bring the drama but keep her hands clean anyone with two brain cells to rub together could crush shelby which is why even paul managed that micayla is the dangerous one,MLeek
it almost made me sorry for micah because those dynamics can be hard to escape if you think that is what friendship is supposed to feel like almost until she immediately joined the pack and turned on paul like a hyena,MLeek
i have never had difficulty enforcing expectations and boundaries on my friends and my partner without suggesting they are competing with one another for my time or attention,MLeek
creating balance and boundaries doesnt require competition and conflict thats not naive thats just declining to live your life doing battle with needy children in grownup bodies getting rid of partners or friends who have that framing has only gotten easier and easier,MLeek
no suggest she speak to a doctor now about her intention to try to get pregnant in the next year or two its a bit early for a preconception checkup but there is no reason not to ask for one if you dont have a family doctor its time for her to try seriously to find one let them tell her if her weight is a significant issue because you dont actually know  bmi is not a medically relevant scale and google isnt med school 75 of pregnant women are overweight its not the bestcase scenario but treating it like a crime isnt accurate either,MLeek
dont pretend to be an authority ask her to speak to an actual authority on what steps can be taken now or in the coming year to be in the best position possible when youre ready,MLeek
stop googling about womens health before you fall down a real rabbit hole of truly inane bullshit,MLeek
the next step in her taking this seriously is speaking to someone who is serious and informed,MLeek
youre not out of bounds to want the best odds but youre way out of your area of expertise and that is not where you start you start by encouraging her to get support so she knows her timelines has some goals and is building relationships with her possible care team,MLeek
the median number of past sexual partners for an american woman age 2549 is 43,MLeek
and nearly 25 of people age 2529 are virgins youre a minority sure but youre not a myth and ya clearly have some baggage and bias associated with your perceptive status,MLeek
if youre only meeting women with a history of gangbangs something youre doing is the problem not women in general,MLeek
first step watch less porn thats not women thats a reflection of your personal choices not lining up with what you claim to want in a partnership,MLeek
second step seek therapy for your warped perspective on your own sexuality and the sexuality of others,MLeek
yeah even more than mental health support i think where lib fails these people is by not providing them with a financial plannerpremarital counselling on legal money matters like just an hour and list of questions sesh,MLeek
i agree from what we saw i thought tiffany did a totally mature sort of um but youre not racking up debt for this cool shit right vibe check and she and brett had some mostly healthy and mutual sounding joshing about being bougie,MLeek
i suspect some of that was also tiffany checking in on her own insecurities about not bringing the same funds into the marriage that brett clearly had if i were tiffany thatd be a concern for me too,MLeek
hopefully they had a more serious conversation about money offcamera but if i was dating a guy who dressed like brett did i would 100 want to make sure this was a luxury spend he had under control before i took steps forward with him when i moved in with my current bf he had a very expensive hobby and i absolutely asked him pointed questions about how he balanced that with other spending priorities and that was just moving in and splitting things 5050 not marriage,MLeek
yeah i didnt really catch the judgment in him either at that moment it was more like chealse was overquick to defend herself when it really wasnt that pink it was a single ladys apartment big shrug,MLeek
there are lots of shitty conversations between these two but that one was rather sweet,MLeek
my bf likes pink more than i do our compromise was deep raspberry pink accent i had to draw a really hard line against hot pink baby pink and pastel,MLeek
if you truly cannot control yourself go talk to a good therapist who can give you a swift verbal kick the next time you get weak and help you approach new relationships without all the anxiety and trauma this shitty one has left you with,MLeek
no one else can solve this problem for you youre gonna waste the rest of your 20s on this mans bullshit and have nothing to show for it if you dont wise up im sorry to be so harsh but it really is that simple,MLeek
stop performing that same drama with this guy that you two started with when you were like 17 its not getting better its not likely to get better better exists for you someplace else with someone else,MLeek
youre not friends any longer you dont bring anything positive into one another lives,MLeek
youre not getting back together you really shouldnt not even after therapy,MLeek
the best help you can give both of you is accepting that six years of on and off plus this toxicity and his untreated mental health issues is to finally call it end it for good grow with someone else someone who doesnt need you to play a perfectly calm therapist in order for them to meet the bare minimum standards of communication and be able to cope,MLeek
go be less insecure with someone who actually offers you security and someone who can handle the fact that anger happens sometimes in a longterm relationship,MLeek
break up with him,MLeek
you cannot stop him he feels entitled to use the images and bodies of women he knows as his own personal porn stars he doesnt care that they are not consenting or that isnt why those images exist or that would reasonably be upset by this behavior or that you are upset by this behaviour he thinks he has the right to do this he thinks he has the right to tell declare that his ex his coworker his buddys sister is a porn star now because he wants her to be,MLeek
dont sit around waiting to catch him break up with him because he doesnt value consent and that is dangerous and unworthy of trust,MLeek
fantasizing inside your own brain is entirely different than choosing to curate photos of people you know and wank to them reprosing photos is an action not a just a private thought only shitty little boys who dont care about consent or respect women like to pretend it isnt because the violation of women they know is pat of what they are enjoying if it wasnt theyd happily use all that free porn no problem,MLeek
the violation is the point the lack of consent is the point get rid of him,MLeek
nah that would result in only contestants who had some fundamental relationship skills and were capable of transparency and honesty with those closest to them,MLeek
then there wouldnt be a show,MLeek
seems like his mom just wouldnt sign a waiver,MLeek
it was just awful i had to fast forward a bit because paul was working so hard to ignore how awful they were without insulting them directly i suspect this is not his first encounter with mean girls but how he didnt realize micah was one i dont know,MLeek
queen bee brunette was clearly deeply jealous and tossing shade in each of those compliments to micah  knowing that sloshed blondey would do the dirty work for her  and lord did she i was just shocked that micah immediately defended her friends totally vague something or other complaint about him he was too articulate not self depreciating enough for her tastes i dunno my 3 year old niece better communicates her upsets than that woman did,MLeek
the nicest thing i can say about kwame right now is that even he doesnt deserve micah,MLeek
your bf used his sister to take the heat for him when his friends sexualized one of their little sisters,MLeek
look your bf isnt treating any woman that well if he only treats them well in private and not when they are being exposed to abuse and ridicule,MLeek
withdraw your ultimatum dont let your bf think its your job or his sisters job to fight his fights for him dont let him make that the womans job too hes quickly becoming the kind of guy who blames the women for making him not be a creep so he doesnt loose too much face with the asshole men expect him to demand his friends treat others with respect if he really cannot hack that dump him,MLeek
dont ride this out for long he will use you and your anger as a shield from real consequences for he behaviour he is part of and is condoning and he will let them mock your rage to keep his friendship if hell do it to his own sister hell do it you,MLeek
all you can do is give good advice,MLeek
ideally kind and compassionate advice,MLeek
objectively the age difference alone and the newness of the relationship are plenty enough to caution against a legal contract but its not clear from your question that either of them are actually rushing into it,MLeek
stop calling her a divorcee and a single mother as if these are insults it makes you sound like youre in your 80s screaming at kids to get off your lawn you will quite rightly loose credibility if you dont accept that single parents and divorcees are not damaged goods shes not in a situation shes living a normal perfectly valid and successful life by all reports here,MLeek
and her career is the couples business not yours,MLeek
if this is a mistake its your sons to make ask him questions be concerned for his happiness give him advice final decisions belong to him   insulting her personally isnt going to change that its okay going to make you appear judgmental and unreliable,MLeek
you dont need to understand,MLeek
youre 40 be the adult here and cut him out hes clearly a toxic child who brings nothing of value to your life how is this even a question,MLeek
he played out his milf fantasy and made some money while he did it hopefully you enjoyed youre bizarre barely legal fun times too now he gets to play with you like a toy whenever hes bored no get rid of him block him everywhere seehs,MLeek
youre not crazy and the hard truth is youre going to need to leave to change this dynamic,MLeek
im the eldest daughter of 8 children google eldest daughter syndrome and you will find you are not alone in your frustrations many are subjected to parentification like you have been in many cases like yours the finances of large families make it seem necessary but its still not healthy or kind,MLeek
while trying to speak to your mom is good please recognize that real change is going to come from you if your mom saw this problem clearly shed address it but she seems to be trying to foist it off on your dad instead of tackling it as as a team so the odds are against that happening reinvest in trying to find a job summer camp work can be a great place for your elder sister skills to shine with appropriate compensation and long periods away from home start saving obsessively and secretly plot your pathway out of this home inside this home you will always be the eldest daughter only when you leave can you become an individual just a sister and a daughter like you deserve to be,MLeek
excuse me youre right i need to be inclusive of my insane sisters,MLeek
women arent a monolith we dont share a hive mind were basically sane individuals like men,MLeek
if youre looking to start a family you should absolutely move to a lower cost of living area most women who want children will very very rationally balk at 33k in greater london if parenting is a goal you should probably make some changes to make that more feasible and as quickly as you can,MLeek
thats not about providing a lifestyle thats about being a compatible partner your heart isnt gonna pay for summer camp or piano lessons very few women will feel secure having a family with you because women are basically rational,MLeek
if youre looking simply date your financial health and living within your means is probably more important when it comes to compatibility youre not compatible with women who want a provider so dont pretend you are,MLeek
dating is hard everyone is screwed youre less of an outlier than you realize its just that hard,MLeek
if he wont acknowledge that he owes it to you and to this marriage to work on the issue that exists solely inside of his head and results in completely inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour towards you then there is nothing you can to do fix this,MLeek
he can moderate both his feelings and his responses he does so successfully in many areas of his life he needs to recognize this one area where the skill is lacking and must be developed,MLeek
there is no resolution without that accountability and realization you cannot support him out of this until he is dedicated to walking the path out of it,MLeek
if youre never going to get angry with him for this behaviour and never admit its damaging or endangering then the relationship then its less likely hell ever be motivated to do that work the status quo works for him if you simply walk on eggs shells until hes triggered absorb this behaviour each time and accept apologies without any real commitment to change if you do that it becomes your operating agreement its the relationship youre both choosing,MLeek
bf i need to be allowed to be angry with you sometimes i am angry with you and disappointed in your contributions this isnt surprising or unfair i understand this hurts your feelings im glad it hurts your feelings because that means you give a damn and i need you to give enough of a damn to change it,MLeek
adhd creates struggles not assholes,MLeek
it can require some grace but not a free pass on  off all the basics certainly not a free pass on saying shitty things like we need to do better when they do not contribute is an existing issue,MLeek
your bf needs to recognize he needs to be a full participant in problem solving that doesnt mean he needs to be perfect but that means recognizing your frustrations are valid and worthy of a thoughtful response not a temper tantrum,MLeek
its okay if its not worth the risk to you right now,MLeek
if youre consistently finding the conversation is getting to the we should probably meet phase and you just dont want too for whatever reason then take a damn break from the apps,MLeek
dating is risky  mostly emotionally this fear of multiple peoples crazy exes seems a bit catastrophizing to me but if that is where youre at stop fighting it while chatting with individuals examine those anxieties on your own for a bit and rethink your goalsboundaries,MLeek
i keep myself safe by picking the place a friend knows where i am and basic info of who im meeting and if i am even the least bit uncomfortable taking a very roundabout way home,MLeek
but most importantly i dont date when im not excited to date if it seems not worth the trouble or stress i pause the apps and go touch grass for a few months,MLeek
you should be doing what makes you feel good and he should love you as you are its weird that hes mad about this if he likes seeing you dressed up thats cool but he should give you a chance to get dressed up for something that makes sense like a nice dinner not football lol im sorry,YourFriendMaryGrace
one night stands might not be a good idea for you personally im demisexual so i only feel sexual attraction if i also feel a deep emotional connection so i never do random hookups bc i know its unhealthy for me emotionally not saying its the same for you but its clear that you are having very strong feelings towards someone who doesnt feel the same way you cant change how he feels you can only try and move forward and avoid this situation in the future,YourFriendMaryGrace
right im kind of astonished that the words trophy violent and blackmails are all being used to describe the same person,YourFriendMaryGrace
you are capable of having a healthy happy relationship even if it didnt work out for your mom she probably means well but shes misguided in thinking that all marriages end horribly lol you have to live your own life and make the choices that are right for you,YourFriendMaryGrace
a lot of manipulative people will try and keep the upper hand by always making you feel like youve messed up and you need to make it right the fact that he packed up and left over this is so extreme im embarrassed for him lol hes not trying to believe you that you mean no harm because it benefits him to act like youre the bad guy youre gonna lose your mind if you try and make it work with him,YourFriendMaryGrace
run no amount of beauty is worth being physically abused and manipulated over shell only get worse i promise you youll be 10x happier with someone who is sane loving and would never dream of hurting you on purpose,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont feel like its that simple for this long of a relationship it kinda is though whether youve been together for a month or a decade the fact that his family does not support your relationship and not only excludes you but actively tries to replace you is a huge problem clearly hes not able to make them cut it out completely and respect your relationship together hes trying to toe the line between pleasing you and them but thats not possible because theyre opposed to you being around at all,YourFriendMaryGrace
i know its hard but please consider if this is what you want for your future because they wont change and it will be a continual source of tension and hurt,YourFriendMaryGrace
exactly i had an ex boyfriend who used this exact method to try and warm me up to abuse repeatedly caused pain and then act like he meant no harm and i was overreacting by not liking it he will escalate it as much as he can op and in any case if a partner sees you setting boundaries as a problem you gotta go,YourFriendMaryGrace
i absolutely know how you feel im working through multiple heartbreak traumas as well and its difficult but worth it for me personally its been really helpful to just stop dating completely for the time being and focus on my healing youll know when youre ready to get back out there hugs,YourFriendMaryGrace
can you please give some examples of him needling poking the bear its hard to get a read on the situation without more context if you feel yourself getting angry do you walk away from the conversation to cool off,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes that is very manipulative for sure thats emotional abuse on top of the physical abuse im very glad you got away from him now you know to walk away at the first sign of someone not respecting your boundaries because if theyll do it once theyll do it again worse and worse big hugs to you im proud of you for getting away and learning from it,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry this happened to you im concerned that you feel bad about threatening to punch him in that scenario please know that if youre ever in that situation again you need to do what you need to do to get away punch him in the face balls whatever you can your friend is the one whos fake af if shes taking his side keep them and people like them out of your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats really sad for her im so glad shes in therapy her innocence was taken away at a very young age due to that exposure and she needs support be a listening ear empathize with her and be supportive of her going to therapy and working through the trauma healing is very much possible and it sounds like shes doing what she can,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sounds like shes testing the waters looking for a replacement for her actual boyfriend unless thats what you want id definitely let her know that you need her to back off,YourFriendMaryGrace
try and pace yourself breakups are traumatizing and it can take a long time to recover and really start thinking clearly again theres nothing wrong with having feelings but id advice against acting on them or even trying to sort out what youre feeling towards her until youve had a few months to heal from the break up,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre allowed to feel how you feel porn is highly addictive and he may have a problem if thats a deal breaker for you thats completely fine and nothing you should feel bad about talk to him about it and see how he responds dont feel bad about how you feel or try and pretend to be cool with it if youre not,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah and im sure that was difficult to deal with since youre only trying to help try and keep in mind that ed is a form of addiction so just like with any addict when they feel like their addiction is being threatened they will lash out even at the people who are trying to help its tough and my heart goes out to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
personally the mundane daily life stuff from the ancient past is the most interesting to me im not that interested in battles or notable events but i love looking at ancient hair and makeup products restaurants home decor etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sounds like he felt cornered and accused next time  try and use more empathetic language like i love the both of you very much and your health and well being is important to me please know that if you ever need support with your ed or anything else now or in the future id like to help,YourFriendMaryGrace
they are adults and they have to make their own decisions so theres only so much you can do im sorry,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my usqitten has given you some solid advice that i agree with please take it to heart the next step with people like her is usually gaslighting making you feel confused and crazy for having a problem with her behavior so please try to keep a clear head and get some outside support as soon as possible,YourFriendMaryGrace
that scares me so much to know that people are being actively shamed for showing empathy empathy is like the 1 ingredient to a healthy society lack of empathy indicates a seriously emotionally unintelligent person if that becomes the ideal were screwed,YourFriendMaryGrace
whaaa familiarize yourself with darvo deny attack reverse victim and offender thats what shes doing theres nothing misogynistic about standing up for yourself and not wanting to be called names does she do this with issues you try to address,YourFriendMaryGrace
i am so very sorry that you lost your brother and father thats an enormous trauma and its very understandable that its affecting your relationships are you in therapy i think you touched on something very important when you said its the same thing i say to myself most of the time we can only give to others the amount of love and empathy that we give to ourselves if youre telling yourself that you shouldnt complain about little problems you wont be able to empathize with others problems either pain comes in all shapes and sizes youre allowed to feel upset about things even if they seem small compared to the tragedy youve experienced and other people are too try and find compassion for yourself and it will get easier to show compassion to your friends,YourFriendMaryGrace
please give yourself a hug from me and feel free to reach out any time i care,YourFriendMaryGrace
im afraid that cant be your problem he has to want to change make solid efforts to do so and find support along the way as it stands youre enabling him which is the last thing he needs i dont want to sound harsh because i know youre confused and caught up in all this but you have to kick him out and let him hit rock bottom out of your sight for your own sake and his,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome and please do i sure benefited from support when i was going through it and im happy to help how i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
the real nightmare is wasting even more years of your life trying fix someone whos broken wayyy beyond your ability to repair i understand im 38 and had to walk away from a narcissist almost exactly a year ago it was so hard but by the third month of being no contact i was healed enough that when he found an excuse to reach out i felt nothing but anger lol now i dont miss him at all and my only regret is sticking around for as long as i did im still single which i thought would be miserable but im so much happier than i was in that relationship but going no contact was essential to being able to move on you have to start there good luck and feel free to reach out if you need support,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you not have access to the internet at home im confused why you feel the need to just be more cautious rather than just stop doing it being careful about whos looking doesnt guarantee you wont get caught again you said yourself they monitor it and can look at the history just stop lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
educate yourself on narcissistic behavior and reading other peoples experiences they all operate from the same playbook and get you hooked on the on again off again cycle it can be very addicting and you will lose your mind if you keep letting her come back also research anxious attachment and codependent attachment im guessing youre somewhere on the spectrum of anxiously attached which makes it much more difficult to let go of people but you have to friend she will not change she will only continue to drain you of all the love and care and energy that you could be giving to someone who can return it,YourFriendMaryGrace
blocking her is absolutely essential because by now she knows exactly how to rope you back in with the smallest interaction,YourFriendMaryGrace
you absolutely did the right thing by telling her that its not a good time to rush into things whether she wants to admit it or not shes still in a state of emotional distress and cant possibly make clear headed decisions at this point ideally you wouldnt have kissed and cuddled her but its done now so all you can do is not do it again anytime soon to be honest it sounds like this could get messy very quickly with her living with you and being unwilling to accept that you want to take things slowly,YourFriendMaryGrace
i mean yes she snitched but you gotta stop looking at inappropriate things on the school computers you will get caught again eventually and its not worth it,YourFriendMaryGrace
coming back to add congrats on getting sober and pulling your life together again that takes enormous strength and im proud of you now boot him lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my bad im not sure why i thought it was it sounds like she might not even be aware of why shes getting triggered but even if she is aware the fact that she wont communicate her issue is all the more reason to try and not let it affect you too much at any age but at your age especially relationships are about learning and growing and getting to know yourself better dont let her weirdness throw you off and make you overthink something thats making you happy,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats odd i wonder if deep down shes feeling sadweird about the fact that youre in your first relationship and just trying to slow it down for her own comfort at 4 months its perfectly normal to talk every day you could try asking her if shes got any concerns but at the end of the day only you can decide whats best for you in this relationship,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope op sees this i feel so bad for him,YourFriendMaryGrace
well regardless shes definitely into you and i think you should ask her to hang out sometime,YourFriendMaryGrace
absolutely do not keep him around kick him out change the locks and never speak to him again he ruined your life once and hell do it again narcissistic people almost always have an addiction of some kind and they will bleed you dry of your time energy and money for as long as you let them who cares that hes attractive i promise you youd be a billion times better off with a healthy happy partner who is less attractive than this mess of a person do not fool yourself into thinking you can help him or that youre his best chance to selfimprovement narcissists love it when you think youre the super special person that can save them because it incentives you to keep trying hes not going to change no matter what you do,YourFriendMaryGrace
it sounds like its way too early for either of you to really know how you feel besides that you like each other and want to see where it goes so im not sure what your question is,YourFriendMaryGrace
from what youve shared here shes 100 into you she was probably hoping for more than just what when she said shed kiss you so she took it back if shes shy then youre probably gonna have to make the next move,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww man my heart goes out to you friend i can tell that you take things very seriously when it comes to how you behave and treat others you are not a horrible person by any means your intentions were misguided but honorable,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think you already know this but your definition of love is very skewed love is not about putting your own needs and feelings aside and suffering in silence not at all in fact you can only love others to the degree that you love yourself i gather that it might be challenging for you as you tend to intellectualize more than you feel but try to really offer yourself as much love and respect and forgiveness as you can throughout all this youve already been selfharming by way of ignoring your own needs dont double down on it by shaming yourself for the fallout if you can get into therapy i think it would be really helpful and definitely try reading some books on healthy relationships so you have a better understanding about what it means to be a good partner,YourFriendMaryGrace
i would highly recommend you stop talking to your ex for a long long time you dont owe her anything and being in contact is only going to confuse you and make it more difficult to move on enjoy life and make your own decisions,YourFriendMaryGrace
which is impossible to do in this case because she doesnt even know who she is or how shes going to be just because shes advanced in her career doesnt mean shes advanced on a personal level that can only happen through time and experience you seem like a smart guy i think you already know you need to let this go,YourFriendMaryGrace
right not to mention the inherent power imbalance of you having so much more life experience and time to get settled even if youre actively trying to make it even and be fair it wont be and your kids deserve for you to have a partner that is allin for them which it certainly sounds like she isnt in a place to be,YourFriendMaryGrace
just the fact that shes looking to settle down because its what her family wants is enough to show you that she still has a ton of growing up and selfdiscovery to do her brain wont be done developing for another 5 years buddy leave her alone for both of your sake,YourFriendMaryGrace
you can tell her that you arent ready to try and work on your relationship at this time without closing the door on the future possibility of that the dissolution of her family was very traumatizing for her im sure and we cant always help what triggers us thats not to say that she was right or fair for how she acted at all just that she may not have been in a very stable emotionalmental place at the time give yourself as much time as you need to enjoy your life without the drama and if you find yourself missing her and wanting to work on it reach out  if and when you do decide to talk to her be honest about how you felt and how it affected you if shes unwilling to acknowledge that she was hurtful its probably best to move on good luck lifelong friends are very special but remember to look after yourself first,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome im proud of you its definitely a process and im still learning alongside you its sad because our natural tendency to be empathetic and helpful and tolerant deserves to be treasured not taken advantage of im hoping for really lovely healthy future partners for the both of us,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have also attracted my fair share of abusivestalkery types they are almost always attracted to peoplepleasers because they know that if they push you in just the right way youll give them what they want build up your confidence and your ability to say no decide before you even meet someone exactly what your boundaries are and stick with them the more you know yourself and find your inner strength the more youll repel people like that and going forward limit your interactions with your ex to essential work business only,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome i hope the conversation goes well,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww man im glad youre at least a little more comfortable but still that sucks dont let the fact that your mom is paying for everything keep you from being upfront about your needs and having a bed is a pretty basic need if she really cares about you having a nice time thats the least she can do and congrats on the wedding,YourFriendMaryGrace
i am so sorry youre going through this i dont know of course but its possible he could have attachment issues read up on avoidant attachment specifically but regardless of the reason which you may never know for sure allow yourself plenty of time to grieve the loss of what you had and what you hoped you could have together youre in the hardest part right now and it will get easier i promise i went through something similar and had to learn the hard way to pace myself in relationships because it really does take time to learn how another person operates on a deep level i think that as you heal and grow from this it will get easier to vet future partners and give yourself some time to feel it out before falling too deep there are people out there who will love you just as deeply as you love them i promise,YourFriendMaryGrace
another thought if you are able to you could go ahead and go find a couch or something in the house and that will kickstart the conversation in the morning when she finds you no longer on the boat,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my you have every right to be annoyed youre the one being celebrated you shouldnt be sleeping on the floor lol im sorry babe it sounds like its too late to switch it up tonight but in the morning i would tell her that you were really uncomfortable and will need an actual bed for the remainder of the trip if you think she might be argumentative or weird about it then bring it up in the group so that others can help you figure something out,YourFriendMaryGrace
its kind of you to not want to hurt her feelings but for the future please know that its perfectly normal and reasonable to tell your partner it makes me uncomfortable to hear about your past partners and experiences i certainly dont want to hear about my partners past lol if you dont see a future with her then i think the sooner you get it over with and tell her the better and i wouldnt advise continuing with the business plan either as that could get messy very quickly,YourFriendMaryGrace
definitely bring it up if its bothering you theres a whole range of possibilities he could just be feeling a little down and its affecting his communication style he could have avoidant attachment issues and you guys getting closer triggered him etc try to open up communication and see what he says if you cant get a straight answer from him or he says nothings wrong but then continues to be distant its probably time to walk away good luck,YourFriendMaryGrace
that makes my day thank you love,YourFriendMaryGrace
ahhhh thank you so much ive been thinking of it like a portal so looking at it through your eyes as a sun or moon adds a whole new perspective and i love it,YourFriendMaryGrace
uartisticnoob both those comparisons are making my day thank you guys,YourFriendMaryGrace
that means so much to me thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
love this,YourFriendMaryGrace
gorgeous love the title too,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
heres a video showing a bit of my process,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love your style,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
love the background colors,YourFriendMaryGrace
oops meant to write 4ft tall cardboard not 5ft anyway heres a video of my process,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes i use brushes occasionally but i find that painting with my hands really helps me loosen up and stop overthinking everything,YourFriendMaryGrace
im glad it found you and you replied its really nice to know its not just me i have an aries stellium too lol we neeeeed the excitement,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have an aries mars so i act like i have no sense whatsoever,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my goodness this made me cry so much wow wow wow i am so proud of you and happy for you and thankful to hear that youre doing so well 3 you have unbelievable strength and power to have made it through everything youve been through i knew you could do it 3 thank you so much for this message it means the world to know that it helped you im always in your corner and here for you any time,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a capricorn moon so i feel bad for myself that i dont know how to feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
well that was way too accurate,YourFriendMaryGrace
no problem good luck to both of you guys,YourFriendMaryGrace
absolutely just the fact that you already kinda talked about it even if it was just joking really helps my ex and i would joke about staying friends no matter what too and we have you might need some time to adjust and reset as individuals but just continue to be respectful and supportive of each other and youll be good,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love this so so much oh my goodness,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so very sorry you went through that especially so many times its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy and yes we do need much better resources for helping people cope and less stigma around talking about it because its so common but so rarely discussed,YourFriendMaryGrace
i mean yes of course thats a bizarre and disturbing thing to do but people dealing with extreme traumatragedy dont always react in logical or appropriate ways i had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and the grief of that alone made me kinda crazy for a while not to mention after childbirth theres a massive hormonal change and a bunch of other stuff thats challenging even when you have a healthy baby idk i just think its way too simplistic to write it off as simply wanting attention or caring about getting likes too much or whatever and i feel bad for her to go through all that and then be dragged down further bc she coped in a really weird way,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh i love these the meat one is so gross but so relatable lol something about being slightly high gets me super in touch with my intuition sometimes i end up doing what seems like completely random shit but then i end up understanding the reason why i felt compelled to do it after the fact nothing as crazy as that though usually just stuff like feeling the need to reach out to a friend and it turns out they just got bad news or something,YourFriendMaryGrace
whoa thats pretty cool did it seem unusually big to you at the time or only in retrospect after that nap like did it go from normal to big and then back to normal or just normal and then way smaller i dont know if that makes sense but i tried,YourFriendMaryGrace
id love to hear some of your experiences if you feel like sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
i wish i had for some reason i had the feeling like i shouldnt go in there im not sure if it was actually a bad idea or just a fear of the unknown but i couldnt bring myself to crawl in and then it was gone,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is my favorite one and i totally believe you i think kids have an ability to peer into dimensions that for whatever reason get harder to see as adults my story isnt as cool as yours but when i was a kid i looked into a pile of pillows that were kind of stacked together in a tunnel shape but somehow the tunnel went on and on like hundreds of times longer than the pillows themselves i walked away and walked back to look again and it was just back to being a normal stack of pillows,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes or like we want to be their new bff when actually were just being genuinely friendly but not like we want to be like friend friends thats the only downside of the placement imo accidentally leading people on,YourFriendMaryGrace
just curious do you feel like that in real life trying to figure out the best direction to take and keep ending up in the wrong places,YourFriendMaryGrace
i would say that the guilt and shame of killing the dog probably factored into the situation a lot but regardless please do not think that all women are like this i have spent the last 3 years trying to help my boyfriend open up cry rage whatever he needs to process his feelings every bit of progress hes made has been so incredibly rewarding and brought us closer together the only way id weed him out as a mate is if he stopped working on expressing his feelings and started trying to be all stoic again as a partner its exhausting and isolating always having to wonder what your mate is really feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you end up with another person who cant handle seeing you cry weed her out and dont look back you do not deserve that sexist bullshit,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sure theres a lot of additional factors like that but from what i understand the tradition stems from the days where talking about womens problems like periods menopause etc were taboo and so miscarriage was supposed to be kept quiet but if someone wants to tell their friends and family early on its easy enough to say that its still early and they should wait a few months before making any purchases,YourFriendMaryGrace
i actually wish the whole dont tell anyone too early notion would go away too losing your pregnancy even if you have only been pregnant for a few weeks can be so incredibly sad and if you havent told anyone then youre either alone in that pain or having to tell people that you need support from that you were pregnant and now youre not of course some people would rather be alone in that process regardless and if thats how they feel theres nothing wrong at all with keeping it quiet i just wish there wasnt a stigma around announcing too early it kind of creates a social isolation around anyone grieving before that 12 week mark,YourFriendMaryGrace
it makes me glad to see someone else talking about the just world fallacy i used to post about it online like a reverse evangelist all the time bc i think its so important for people to understand that this way of thinking is prevalent and insidious even nonreligious people do it without realizing it either to avoid having to empathize or to make themselves feel like if they just do everything right theyll be safe,YourFriendMaryGrace
im curious about the microdose my life has been changed in other ways due to a standard amount of it on separate 3 occasions over 2 years was it a one time thing and did you go into it with the intention of facing your addictions,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit also congrats on your accomplishment really encouraging to hear your progress,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a theory that the rest of your chart plays into what kind of connections youll enjoy which is a little too complicated for an app to take into consideration for example my venus is in aries so i kinda like it when things are exciting aka complicated lol so for me a delicate or complex bond is stimulating and fun but an extraordinary or powerful bond can be boring like its too easy,YourFriendMaryGrace
what did the tire look like,YourFriendMaryGrace
ahh same here i guess its been about 2 or 3 weeks for me that ive obsessing over my jaw muscles bc something just felt off i kept trying different massage techniques to make it feel normal again this is really interesting,YourFriendMaryGrace
did you feel it when our ribs changed,YourFriendMaryGrace
you sound like a really good person your mama is lucky to have you,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats beautiful it seems like most souls tend to reincarnate within the same family i bet hes been really looking forward to seeing you guys again,YourFriendMaryGrace
first of all im very sorry for your loss  thats really cool about the dream and i firmly believe that the women in a family line are super tuned in to the energy of new babies when i was pregnant with my kids i didnt want to know the gender until they were born but me my mom and my grandmother were completely positive i was having a girl and i was same thing with my next baby we knew it was a boy and he was,YourFriendMaryGrace
pluto heres a pic of my chart feel free to ask any questions,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have those two in my second house i tend to have a lot of money or none lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
how did it work out if you dont mind sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
this hurt my heart to read  i love people who dress however makes them happy and i hate to think of her being made to feel bad about her awesome quirky self,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much 3 im okay im thankful that my dogs life was so full and happy and that she had such a peaceful ending and there are positives to being single and not having an elderly dog to tend to any more such as being more free and independent traveling etc so its really hard to cope with all at once but im trying to think of it as a new chapter with gratitude,YourFriendMaryGrace
in my 9th house on the night of the lunar eclipse i told my boyfriend for the billionth time that we needed to start doing some very things differently because i just wasnt happy in our relationship and he said hed work on it but he didnt so on june 8th i broke things off then later that night my sweet little dogs health took a serious turn for the worse and i had to put her down on the morning of the eclipse ive had her with me for 14 years she was a gemini sun and sagittarius moon im heartbroken,YourFriendMaryGrace
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace
see  for more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
its amazing you were able to recognize the pain you were causing and turn it around especially after everything you went through yourself just commenting to say im proud of you and dont give up on your brother closest in age it may take time but if hes able to heal on his own he may come around to the idea of a closer relationship with you,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats a good life skill to have,YourFriendMaryGrace
did you get to play with them,YourFriendMaryGrace
so it was entrapment what a bastard,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww thats a good one my little boy is 4 years old now and i always wonder what random stuff hell remember,YourFriendMaryGrace
lol and of all the beverages you could have chosen to spit out you went with the one most likely to stain the carpet,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww those early childhood accomplishments are the best,YourFriendMaryGrace
how did that turn out,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a vivid memory of standing in my cousins yard staring at a tree,YourFriendMaryGrace
im not a christian but uanotherreaderofstuff is right the bible does say that although its in matthew not revelation start on verse 34 of jesus sermon in matthew 25 hes saying that if you didnt take care of the poor imprisoned etc while you were on earth you dont get a spot in heaven,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow thats really cool would you mind sharing what sort of meaningless thoughts and views you saw yourself having as a teen i feel like i waste a lot of energy on meaningless thoughts now as an adult but im trying to improve,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for sharing i hope the despair goes away completely soon and that you find more and more warmth and happiness in your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah its a different song but its a similar vibe to the beach boys so im thinking op might have just misremembered slightly,YourFriendMaryGrace
are you thinking of this one,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats a real gift i have it too with some close friends for example once i started spontaneously crying while i was in the shower and i had no idea why i wasnt even sad but my friends name came to mind immediately after so i texted him and sure enough hed just had a heartbreaking thing happen to him i think its possible our brains are silently communicating with each other in ways we cant observe with current technology and some may just have stronger communication links than others whatever it is im glad you guys found each other,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
you should give it a go theres some great ones on youtube you could try people seem to have a lot of success with this one  i totally get being wary but it seems like the subconscious has a mechanism of sorts that will only allow you to see what you can handle i tried many times before i saw anything and when i finally did i understood why i hadnt been able to see it before i actually participated in a thread about this recently if youre interested it seems to be a somewhat common experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
its its complicated lol but i love him very much when i saw him in the glass thing i looked at him for a long time and then i understood that hed be hurting a lot in this life then i understood a second thing that made me agree to him being my dad unfortunately i dont remember at all what that second thing was but i assume its something that im not supposed to remember just learn over time,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh wow ill have to check it out thank you for telling me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i did a past life regression once where i saw myself choosing my parents i was sat in front of a giant clear glass with a gold frame that had pictures of all the options and i could kind of flip through them like turning pages in a book but with my mind i was flipping through them thinking nope nope nope because i felt nothing when i looked at the couple until i got to my parents and i totally freaked out with excitement because i recognized my moms soul from having what felt like thousands of happy lifetimes together i said she could be my mom yes yes yes and then i looked at my dad and didnt recognize him at all but understood they were a package deal theres more details but yeah it was very interesting,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh interesting my little boy always called water by what sounded like whoa im curious now if that sound matches the word for water in another language,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh wow i love this  thank you for sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
theoretically though if a conscious or soul if you prefer doesnt need a living brain and body to operate from then one could exist in a plant animal maybe even a drop of rain or just floating in space,YourFriendMaryGrace
22 is an incredibly powerful number in numerology its considered by many to be the most powerful master number really cool that you have a significant astrological event on that date i cant tell you what to expect but i wish you the best,YourFriendMaryGrace
adderall starts trying to make the bed while youre still in it,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre awesome thank you for saying that i sure want to be a good mother she deserves it re my big 3 yes i absolutely feel pulled in many directions a lot today my pisces sun just wants to meditate feel my feelings read tarot cards and sit with my crystals while my libra rising wants to shop for new nail polish and hang out with my boyfriend meanwhile my cap moon is telling me that all of the above is a luxury and i shouldnt indulge until my house is spotless and ive researched some investments,YourFriendMaryGrace
bless you this is all so helpful and encouraging and helps me understand whats going on in her brilliant little head going from distraught to cracking jokes is sooo her its nice to know that isnt unusual and i absolutely love the idea of turning the process of talking about her feelings into a game itself i think shed really enjoy that and it would help create a more positive association with emotional processing bc right now i think she wants to but then feels like it is too boring lol shes a great reader but shes not writing fast enough yet to keep up with all she wants to say so maybe i can create another little game for that where she can tell me what shes thinking and i write it down for her,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising my only gemini placement is my chiron but i do have my moon and neptune in the third house,YourFriendMaryGrace
look up attachment styles and specifically anxious attachment i have this and its a struggle but being aware of it is hugely helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is such lovely and helpful advice i cant thank you enough definitely sounds like my little fairy she even says no one understands me sometimes which makes my heart ache i have another question if you dont mind a lot of times when shes feeling things deeply and lashing out i take her to a private place and give her space to talk about what shes feeling she often says that first she wants to play some word games like coming up with a word for each letter of the alphabet sooo gemini and i do but then it can be almost impossible to get her to actually start talking about her feelings shell just keep suggesting other games i guess what im trying to figure out is if playing games is actually helping her or is she just avoiding processing her feelings,YourFriendMaryGrace
my 6 year old daughter has the same big 3 as you if you have any parenting advice pls share,YourFriendMaryGrace
my lifetime before this one i was human in terms of how i felt like my sense of individuality and my emotions but i looked more like a cheetah or leopard on two legs i could run and climb really really fast the planet i lived on was completely peaceful so much so that i found it almost boring i spent most of my time on a small space craft doing missions with my friends who were giant blue lobster looking guys we all communicated telepathically i remember more details about my job than anything else unfortunately i dont remember anything about my childhood and i dont remember there being anything like what we would call a couple or a family so i wonder how babies were even made there wish i could remember more maybe someday,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah those memories were rough they were so much worse than i would have guessed as for who he is in this life the tv show is still on the air and hes still on it so i have some idea of what hes like in this lifetime it seems like hes still got some anger issues but hes come a loooooong way thats for sure i havent tried to contact him im afraid id just sound like a deranged fan lol but im okay with not meeting him in this life i feel like we reincarnate with the people who were meant to learn from in each life so if theres anything to be gained by us meeting itll happen on its own,YourFriendMaryGrace
and its a pleasure talking with you too thank you for sharing your story i was in high school when 911 happened and it was all so shocking and tragic its oddly comforting to think of the victims living new lives and the things that happened to them being a distant memory but im so very sorry that happened to you and i hope you get the answers you seek,YourFriendMaryGrace
not the person youre responding to but ive had experience with not being ready to remember certain things years ago i used to watch this tv show with a clist celebrity that isnt very interesting on his own but watching him made me feel deeply angry but also kind of aroused im not someone who easily forms emotional attachments to celebrities so this was really confusing bc the feelings were just so irrationally strong i did at least half a dozen past life regressions and never saw anything about him then years later after i had done a lot of work on personal stuff that was affecting me in this life a flood of memories came back while i was meditating that pretty much answered all my questions i wont get into the details but basically he was my uncle in a past life and he was horrible to me but i had a stockholm syndrome type of affection for him nonetheless i saw the horrific things he did to me and yeah i was definitely not ready to see that back when i first started trying,YourFriendMaryGrace
the reasons youre not able to see it might be different but like uredseaaquamarine said youll see it when youre ready and itll probably make sense to you then why you couldnt see it before,YourFriendMaryGrace
aries,YourFriendMaryGrace
scorpio,YourFriendMaryGrace
leo,YourFriendMaryGrace
im up for almost anything but prefer that it be exciting or novel in some way i feel a little awkward being romantic in the traditional sense so flowers chocolate etc is definitely not a requirement,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is great advice thank you so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
aries,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow thats interesting i found myself reflecting on some events that i experienced in feb 2018 just this morning do you happen to have any more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
my son is a scorpio sun and rising leo moon hes only 4 years old though any advice you may have for me as a parent would be appreciated,YourFriendMaryGrace
how long do you cook for,YourFriendMaryGrace
im close pisces sun cap moon and libra rising im your slightly more approachable sibling,YourFriendMaryGrace
not that it matters but what the hell is the context of that like whos children immigrants liberals just random kids,YourFriendMaryGrace
no problem this one  from 2016 is good because it recaps the historic events that followed previous similar conjunctions like the ones had last year,YourFriendMaryGrace
it depends on what youre looking at studying theres different areas of focus like personal astrology your ownsomeone elses birth chart synastry how two peoples charts interact with each other which is used for relationships mundane astrology is used to predict events and tbh im not educated enough on the methods to help with a recommendation,YourFriendMaryGrace
i usually look at similar themes in my real life housesapts often represent the dreamers own mind so in this case it might be about wanting to make some changes in yourself but feeling like youre going from bad to worse mentally just an example but hopefully helps,YourFriendMaryGrace
theres a lot of old like years old astrology articles saying that 2020 would be a globally historic shitshow we had a whole lot of these types of conjunctions over the past year and were not done the newspaper style horoscopes and stuff are definitely bs but actual astrology the type that is ancient and takes years to learn is really very interesting,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really like em i think the piscescap combo balance each other out nicely and the libra rising gives me a nice approachable vibe,YourFriendMaryGrace
libra rising,YourFriendMaryGrace
yayyy how do you feel about the combo,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey were almost twins i have libra rising,YourFriendMaryGrace
i couldnt get into the clinical trials so i did a kind of diy version on my own but heres a good rundown on how they do it i had a friend sit with me and im so thankful id love to pay it forward so if you need someone to sit with you id be very glad to help via zoom or something,YourFriendMaryGrace
i still struggle at times with intimacy but ive come a loooong way regular therapy helped a lot as well as using mdma aka molly in a therapeutic setting i can go into more details about that if youre interested for me the biggest hurdle was admitting to myself that i needed help processing it and healing,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so awful and so fucked up of your friends to respond that way im so sorry theres nothing lucky about having your bodily autonomy violated no matter what the violator looks like to suggest otherwise is a gross ignorant lack of empathy and understanding it took me 13 years to tell anyone what happened to me because i was so afraid of not being believed so my heart really really goes out to you knowing how much not being believed just adds to the trauma of it all,YourFriendMaryGrace
i believe you and im so sorry that happened to you please dont think that because you didnt force her off that you are to blame in any way response to trauma is automatic and we dont really get to consciously choose between fight flight and freeze i froze when i was coerced into sexual abuse as a teen and for a long time i felt shame about it but i shouldnt and neither should you,YourFriendMaryGrace
could be a past life memory,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a few questions that would help with interpretation whos house is it are you in the same house every time or does it change what about the locations are you in the living room basement etc are there any patterns in which part of the house the attackers come through,YourFriendMaryGrace
where is your glowworm now,YourFriendMaryGrace
seems like theres quite a few of us i hope its symbolic like of an era in a spiritual sense also funny sync that you responded to me just now bc i was literally just thinking about you you wrote me some very kind encouraging words during a rough patch a few years ago and im forever thankful,YourFriendMaryGrace
weird my boyfriend and i both had vivid dreams last night in his dream he lost his job and his house burned down in my dream my house was being torn apart an apocalyptic storm and my son was terribly injured,YourFriendMaryGrace
theyre in the very late degrees of capricorn right now and by the 21st of this month theyll be in aquarius,YourFriendMaryGrace
what are you listening to,YourFriendMaryGrace
same here i miss being able to look at the houses,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry when you say everybody else who do you mean,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey congrats i got off mine about 3 years ago and im so glad i did i learned that the meds were putting a damper on my positive feels too not just the negative ones so while i might have some moments once in a while of feeling much sadder than i would on meds i also get to experience a lot more excitement love happiness etc every day  btw i highly recommend taking st johns wort herbal supplements if you can theyre cheap otc nonaddictive  and as effective as some ssris at curbing depression,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway whats a song youve listened to lately,YourFriendMaryGrace
whats the weirdest food order youve ever gotten,YourFriendMaryGrace
well the fact you skate tells me that you arent too lazy to move your body you know how to get back up when you fall  and you like to learn new things keep it up you can apply the same energy to other things now and in the future,YourFriendMaryGrace
well maybe you just havent found out what makes you feel alive yet school is great but its not everything and failing definitely doesnt make you a loser what do you do when youre not being productive,YourFriendMaryGrace
what makes you think youre a loser,YourFriendMaryGrace
i see i dont know if it will require a harness or not then but maybe is that something that youre worried about,YourFriendMaryGrace
gah thats messed up i wonder if theres any kind of loans for stuff like this that would have lower payments im uninsured right now and thankfully my health is good but yeah its scary how fast medical debt can pile up here in the states,YourFriendMaryGrace
and youre welcome im always here if you want to chat or vent or just need some encouragement youll see the other side of this someday and in the meantime be kind to yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for everything youre going through thats a lot why do you have to come up with the money in just two days,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry this happened to you thats awful you deserve better people in your life and i hope you find them,YourFriendMaryGrace
im not sure theres different types of buses but usually they dont have harnesses,YourFriendMaryGrace
i relate to this i was raised in an uberconservative environment i literally only knew of two people in my hometown who were openly liberal lol and it wasnt until my midtwenties that i felt safe expressing just how different my views are now if i can offer some advice when you do start talking about it be as calm and as humble as you can im amazed how open minded people can be when they dont feel like they have to defend themselves using phrases like i was surprised to learn or something ive been thinking about lately really helps i think it will also help a lot that you are interested in doing things differently and what you would like to see in a new political party the whole democrats vs republicans thing is so toxic and it gets people all worked up but by approaching it from a neutral perspective and making it about new ideas you can really help people open their mind even if they dont admit it to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
are you trying to decide whether you want to try it,YourFriendMaryGrace
lol i get that what part of history are you learning about rn,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope you enjoy the new program im sure it will be a cool and safe experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
do the people around you know that you no longer agree with those views or are you keeping it quiet for now if they know how did they respond,YourFriendMaryGrace
whats one thing youd change about your life right now if you could,YourFriendMaryGrace
im afraid have massively different perspectives on this my friend i can see how you feel im being obtuse because you seem obtuse from my perspective but were not were just on very different pages and thats okay you are fully entitled to your perspective and i wish you well,YourFriendMaryGrace
they could share that wealth to an enormously powerful beneficial extent if they chose to but they choose not to if youre a part of my company supply chain whatever and you help me earn 20 dollars and then i keep 1999 for myself and gift you with a penny i have generated wealth for you doesnt mean i am a great person doing great things for you im a selfish dick capitalizing off your work and reaping the benefits,YourFriendMaryGrace
they are not generating immense wealth for anybody but themselves and their shareholders instead of murdering a dozen or so people serial killer style they are in possession of millions of wage slaves who must grind away for decades just to hopefully have food shelter and healthcare that is not productive use in my book not at all,YourFriendMaryGrace
of course and btw i think the story of your friend giving you the crystal is so cool those spiritually intuitive kinda friends are a blessing,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont think its idiotic at all i think its really cool that theyll share those placements and i bet they will have a lot of understanding for each other as they grow up,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was curious too so i found this tldr he said he wanted to save the government money by hiring his own security team,YourFriendMaryGrace
as others have already mentioned thats not a good astrology app but in addition i think they have some kind of listening capability builtin because their do and dont keywords have been way too accurate for me more than once when i was redecorating my front porch i got front porch as a do for the day another time i was asking my boyfriend if we had any parchment paper and parchment was one of my dos the next day thats not astrology thats spying lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have the same theory the whole jesus as messiah storyline is remarkably similar to much older mythological origin stories including the virgin birth and coming back from the dead and its paul who flipped all the stuff jesus said about helping the poor on its head and said instead if a man doesnt work he shouldnt eat actually paul flipped just about everything jesus said around and christians believe what paul says jesus  uh  meant to say far more than they believe what jesus actually said christianity is 100 a religion of paul jesus the man would have wanted nothing to do with it,YourFriendMaryGrace
taxpayers are already footing the bill for their being arrested sentenced jailed on probation etc treating it as an addiction rather than a crime might very well end up being cheaper and actually help people but we will see agree withu2muckingfuch that this will serve as a good test run either way,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like you youre smart i think the democratic party has utterly failed to address the most important issues facing americans and frankly im not convinced those at the top level care one bit except for bernie of course theyd rather go hog wild combatting fringe issues and demonizing anybody who supports trump than look at themselves critically in 2016 i wrote a mildly critical comment about hillary on a liberal site and got nasty hateful messages for weeks and i even said in my comment that i do not at all support trump theres this selfrighteous fuck everybody who disagrees attitude among democrats that is gonna be the death of them if they dont change im like you still figuring out my politics but socialism seems to be the best way forward for us imo but like uapi is saying we have to start by putting up a candidate who will earnestly address the very legitimate concerns of the american heartland and stop being so damn unwelcoming to anyone who isnt already on our side,YourFriendMaryGrace
at the end of the day humans just want to feel like theyre safe and cared for trump obviously makes people feel that way and while i dont understand why i do understand how the left makes them feel unsafe and unwelcome,YourFriendMaryGrace
definitely look into wing chun according to legend it was created by a woman which is pretty cool im a small person as well and i dont like violence so the approach of training primarily to disableescape from attackers appealed to me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i wish more people understood this,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really hope youre right my friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
conservatives say its all soros liberals say its all koch bros andor putin i think the truth is probably all of the above and much more were merely puppets on the string of the super wealthy being manipulated into turning on each other so we dont look up and realize were all being swindled by the same forces anybody who thinks the billionaires on their side are actually on their side are painfully naive its an illusion if we united as a people wed be too powerful for their absolute greed to continue going unchecked as it has been for decades and thats their worst nightmare,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really truly think that this civil war narrative is being pushed into the conversations of both sides by an outside source theres major world powers that would have a lot to gain by americans being so divided against each other i have dear loved ones on both sides and nobody i know irl wants bloodshed online though i see it brought up more and more by both sides equally and both sides seem convinced that they have no choice because the other side is already planning on it i dunno maybe im paranoid but it all just feels very  orchestrated,YourFriendMaryGrace
for sure then again it could just as well be about anger youre actually feeling towards him but its just being illustrated in a satirical and overthetop kinda way dreamland is a very symbolic and metaphorical place and the details matter for example the computer keyboard the sloppy food they both mean something specific about something in your life that is or has made you feel pretty strongly the computer keyboard might mean that this is a dream about anger youre feeling specifically in regards your communications with the outside world or perhaps while working from home the sloppy food might mean youre feeling disgust too im just spitballing but you get the idea,YourFriendMaryGrace
hope its ok that i said all that i just get excited about dreams lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
love your style,YourFriendMaryGrace
i help people interpret their dreams as a hobby and i might be able to shed a little light quite often the people we see in our dreams arent playing the part of themselves they often represent a different side of yourself that you identify in them for example i have a very spiritual side but i also have a very logical reasoning side i have a friend darion who is pretty dismissive of anything spiritual metaphysical etc when ive had moments of feeling conflicted about these two sides of myself theyre often followed by dreams of me and darion being on bad terms even though were getting along fine so i see it as darion representing my logical side and my subconscious mind trying to tell a story that calls attention to this disconnected person within me,YourFriendMaryGrace
just something to consider in case its helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace

i have the same placement i think it is playing out for me like this the scorpio south node means that my past lives and my past in this life tends to be filled with drama power struggles abuse of some kind and money problems i feel my mission is to find peace stability and prosperity in this life and basically stop expectingcocreating chaos i think this tumultuous time period were in with the virus and worldwide political issues is such a good opportunity to be a port in the storm so to speak the inspiring thing about this placement is that if you believe in past lives you can bet that you have already been through just about everything a person can go through and youre still here youre stronger for it and you can handle anything its okay to just relax and enjoy life and lean into those lovely taurean traits like gardening enjoying good food and indulging all your senses,YourFriendMaryGrace
absolutely my bffexhusband and i have had a lot of lives together i think it sounds so cheesy but the first night we spent together we didnt even fool around just stared into each others eyes and felt completely at home i didnt even believe in past lives at the time yet i felt like id finally found him now 15 years later hes still the only person i can just look into their eyes forever and never feel uncomfortable were divorced but we are still as close as ever weve both done past life regressions and seen lives weve had together usually as a couple or just dear friends,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have another friend that i feel for some reason was my son in a past life ive also had the experience of simply locking eyes with a stranger and thinking i know them like an instant love and familiarity and it always makes me wonder if its a loved one from another lifetime,YourFriendMaryGrace
you need to be able to heal and process and release trauma before those experiences become helpful imo ive dealt with everything from sexual abuse to homelessness and for a long time it did weaken me but years and a lot of psychedelics therapy yoga etc later i feel pretty damn powerful i think that what doesnt kill you  saying does a disservice in the same way that calling cancer patients fighters does it gives the impression that if you dont possess a superhuman ability to immediately bounce back to better than before youre somehow deficient the focus should be on healing and transmuting and being supported until you start to feel stronger,YourFriendMaryGrace
im here for you if you ever want to chat,YourFriendMaryGrace
my cap moon is in the 4th house and cleaning my home makes 95 of my bad feelings feel better for a little while,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a pisces sun but a cap moon and 4 aries placements i still come across as gentle to most people at first,YourFriendMaryGrace
theres a lot of interpretations but generally i just take it as a sign im on the right path i would look into numerology if youre interested in learning more about the particular energy numbers carry you can even generate a free reading online based on your name and birthdate,YourFriendMaryGrace
it really does thank you shes amazing and i love the way her clever little mind works and i just want to support her the best i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
that sounds just like my 6 year old gemini sunmoon daughter any parenting advice for me especially when it comes to the tantrums,YourFriendMaryGrace
to be fair a lot of things have happened this year that we wouldnt have thought would happen in a million years its kind of the theme,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats what i hope for at this point,YourFriendMaryGrace
those are great placements imo having your moon and ascendant in the same sign helps because peoples first impression of you is better aligned with your inner self descendant signs can often represent your shadow side parts of yourself that are underdeveloped but having it the same sign as your sun means those traits are much more inherent in you,YourFriendMaryGrace
amazing i have the same placement of chiron and related to all of this i started unintentionally having spiritualmetaphysical experiences at a very young age that didnt jive with the religion of my family and community it was difficult enough just to process those experiences alone and trying to explain them was impossible and socially risky so i kept quiet im still figuring out how to share my thoughts and feelings about things without sounding crazy lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
i feel the same way about my pisces suncap moon thankful to have both bc i can see myself being extremely lazy or a workaholic with just one or the other lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
if the relationship is no longer healthy and the parents cant get along they already have an unstable family unit plenty of people grow up to wish their parents had just divorced rather than stay together arguing and being passive aggressive all the time,YourFriendMaryGrace
the 29th degree sun year is said to be a time of preparation for the changes to come when your progressed sun changes signs mine changes from aries to taurus next year and i am kind of feeling that energy like im getting ready for something,YourFriendMaryGrace
if he knew anything about true astrology hed know that summing someone up based on their sun sign is ridiculous unfortunately there will always be people who have a prejudice against certain signs but thats life you geminis are awesome and he sounds like a terrible friend lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
i feel like its safe to say they hardly ever use it that way this is their time to plot and scheme amongst themselves safe from the peoples expectations and opinions getting in the way,YourFriendMaryGrace
really rough but ultimately it was all necessary for me to transform into a much more authentic version of myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes i hear what youre saying and i cosign your petition for everyone to stop with the gun waving,YourFriendMaryGrace
right im referring to ops comment about his real life interactions the ones that know were not racist were there last night and people with open minds were willing to hear us out and have conversations with us,YourFriendMaryGrace
and saying that i dont think its fair to dismiss what hes saying about his real life experience and intentions just because it sounds like something trolls say,YourFriendMaryGrace
its crazy and honestly it scares me im reminded of that noam chomsky quote all the time lately,YourFriendMaryGrace
the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrum,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry but thats a stretch billions of people converse every day lol you cant attribute everything that is said and done in the real world to divisive online lingo personally i prefer to engage in good faith and if it doesnt work out i move on,YourFriendMaryGrace
why are we really at the point where wanting to have a conversation is suspicious if so then were completely screwed because exchanging ideas and perspectives is crucial for peace,YourFriendMaryGrace
woah thats crazy my first name in this life is similar to a name ive had before but dying in an alley and being reborn as ali is wild i hope remembering how tough you had it before has helped you release any guilt about having it good in this life you deserve all the best ali,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes ive done it many times probably at least a dozen times lol but its only worked twice in total ive seen 4 of my past lives one through regular meditation one through a guided meditation like this one was in a dream i had after a psychedelic trip and the most vivid and recent one ive been remembering since i was a little girl,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats funny i almost asked you if you have any fears related to big cities or alleyways honestly its really great to hear that youve had a good life this time your story was very sad and it sounds like youshe more than deserved a break this go round,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you have any experiences or feelings in this life that might be influenced by hers im always interested in the parallels like ive had a lifelong determination to only have sex with people who truly appreciate me as a person and then in one of my past life regressions i saw myself as a woman who had really low selfesteem and let herself be used by a bazillion different guys bc she thought being sexy was her only valuable quality,YourFriendMaryGrace
magician  and i relate to the description very cool thanks for sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats really heartbreaking im sorry 3,YourFriendMaryGrace
well im 35 years old and im embodying my libra rising more than ever so dont hold your breath,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow this is my boyfriends placement if you dont mind me asking were you bullied or just generally made to feel small by a parent,YourFriendMaryGrace
weird i didnt sleep at all last night and my 3yo was awake until like 3am my 6yo woke up about 4am and never went back to sleep,YourFriendMaryGrace
no problem im still fairly new myself browsing this sub plus reading birth and synastry charts of people i know then looking up the placements and aspects that interest me have been my best learning tools,YourFriendMaryGrace
its giving you the option of which astrological method youd like to use placidius and whole sign are probably the most commonly used ones around here personally i prefer whole sign you can search those terms in this sub for a lot more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
did you guys get more than a one time relief payment of 1200 months ago,YourFriendMaryGrace
damn im so sorry youre going through all this,YourFriendMaryGrace
another fireball checking in i have mars mercury and venus in aries also lilith do you mean that mars is in your third house in your natal chart or transit natal placements tell you how those energies will most clearly manifest in your life as a whole transit charts ie where mars is in your chart right now will tell you how youre currently being affected,YourFriendMaryGrace
is it in your 6th house in your birth chart or do you mean thats your current mars transit my natal mars is aries in the 7th house but right now its transiting my 6th house i am feeling super motivated in my health and wellness routines and getting a lot of things done that ive been putting off,YourFriendMaryGrace
well thats awesome youve already laid out a foundation for some really helpful stuff definitely give mdma a go if you can get your hands on some quality stuff if you need someone available to talk to during your trip id be really happy to help dm me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think you already know this but start by putting dating wayyy on the back burner until youre in a better relationship with yourself this woman was able to use you because you dont yet fully believe you deserve to be treated as an equal as for what to do expect some trial and error and be open to trying a lot of different things i highly recommend beginning a meditation practice because over time you will learn to detach yourself from your thoughts rather than letting them run the show and negative selfimage is the product of negative thoughts about yourself run wild it sounds like you have a lot of emotional trauma with regards to women and being in society in general so therapy can help you work through a lot of things using psychedelics like mdma with the intention of revisitinghealing negative experiences has been lifechanging for me but of course you should do your research and proceed with caution etc etc also work on building healthy platonic relationships its much easier to get sucked into an unhealthy romantic relationship when you dont have a solid friend or two you can lean on for support and honest feedback,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry this happened to you and i hope you keep working on yourself and your mindset because there really are great people out there who will treat you as well as you treat them,YourFriendMaryGrace
i worked in the tiny backstage of a 105 year theatre before i got laid off due to not being able to have shows anymore i dont know for sure because testing wasnt really available in my area at the time but i think i had the virus already working with internationally traveling performers and crew every day in tight quarters is challenging even without this particular virus idk if i can do that lifestyle again,YourFriendMaryGrace
it kinda blew my mind how people were celebrating it like i can understand being happy to see liberal media go down if you arent at all liberal but how could it not even cross their minds it what an awful precedent it was setting,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah hulk hogan vs gawker and im still sad about it gawker could be hella trashy but they had some really great journalists too and were one of the very few mainstream media companies left that were not owned by a billionaire,YourFriendMaryGrace
my dad is a retired doctor and has been in a remarkable number of situations where he has been able to help people off the clock via witnessing car accidents people having heart attacks on planes and at a gas station i dont know what it is either but i like to think the universe has a way of putting brave and helpful people like you guys where theyre needed sometimes,YourFriendMaryGrace
what is the factor,YourFriendMaryGrace
not his literal house though he said my fathers house meaning the temple people had basically turned the temple into a moneymaking scheme and jesus was extremely not okay with that thus the table flipping and such,YourFriendMaryGrace
because paul the opportunist came along and claimed to be miraculously converted from the guy who loved dragging jesuss followers to be stoned to the guy who was given special permission to tell everyone what jesus really meant to say he proceeded to write tons and tons of letters that he claimed were the word of god to the point that more than half of the new testament is just paul blabbering on urging people to be judgmental saying stuff completely opposite of what jesus taught and modern christianity is entirely based on pauls teaching not jesus,YourFriendMaryGrace
rpracticaleffects especially this post,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh i have a bunch of these and i do think some might be actual alternate timelines playing out like my dream self pops over to experience it for a little while theres a huge openair church that looks like a remodeledexpanded version of the church i grew up in i am no longer religious and i dont go to church but in these dreams it seems im still trying to play along and its very lonely disempowered feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
but the most frequent ones happened around 20122013 and they were scary the world was a dangerous lawless place and my ex husband we were still married at the time though and i had to be extremely careful about leaving our apartment bc there were so many violent people everywhere but every time i was there i knew that apartment complex parking lot etc like the back of my hand even though it doesnt exist in my life here,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really like to help people interpret their dreams because i have a gift for reading the metaphorical language of dreams but these types of dreams are just so different in the way they feel and the content is so undreamlike that when i have them i dont even try to interpret them anymore i just assume i went timeline hopping again lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
i read somewhere that the draconic nn is set to aries because of the idea that ultimately were all on a solo soul mission of some kind and aries represents that energy personally i resonate with my draconic chart in some ways more so than my birth chart but im not educated enough on it to speak to its validity,YourFriendMaryGrace
you dont have to do anything really except be mindful of your thoughts and feelings if you feel anger frustration anxiety whatever lean into it enough to see whats really under there we all have shadows and trauma and stuff weighing us down but remember that this is the energy of rebirth too releasing the old makes room for the new i like to do some symbolic things too like during the day i will clean my house really well get rid of some clutter and at night ill take a long bath or shower idk  just something about getting my environment and myself super clean while thinking about releasing and cleansing stuff that my old self went through really feels good,YourFriendMaryGrace
you can google rituals and stuff but i suggest trying different things and seeing what feels good and helpful to you just remember to keep directing your mind,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces so i cant do anything about it myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
lol my capricorn moon strongly disagrees,YourFriendMaryGrace
ooo id be interested in reading this if you have a link,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a capricorn moon my mom is a virgo moon and she had me when she was 25yo she is a cancer sun and i think thats a combo that led to difficulty expressing her emotions in a healthy way but shes improved a lot i had my first born gemini moon when i was 29 and my second child leo moon 25 years later,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think so i feel like i relate to my draconic chart more now than i would have if id seen it at a younger age but i think a lot of it depends on the souls evolution and intention for this incarnation maybe we take on the natal chart characteristics well need for this leg of the journey and for some people more than others that may mean a drastic change in how they operate compared to their draconian chart for example my exs draconic chart has a ton of capricorn and virgo placements which is baffling because he hardly has a drop of those energies in his birth chart or personality lol but his north node is in gemini so it kind of makes sense like if he came into this life with a capvirgo heavy chart itd be that much harder for him to embrace the free curious excitable gemini qualities hes meant to embrace this goround,YourFriendMaryGrace
is it really that bad i have toe thumbs and i try to tell myself its okay but i dont feel like its okay,YourFriendMaryGrace
pisces being lazy my capricorn moon almost completely cancels out my ability to be lazy unless my chores are done and im at somebody elses house where im not distracted by other things i could be getting done,YourFriendMaryGrace
when i was really little i was so gentle and looooved helping people to the point where my older brothers friends would take advantage of my kindness asking me to go get them water or whatever stuff they could have easily done for themselves and id do it one of my earliest memories of getting really pissed off is from when i was in first grade and my brothers friend told me to go get him something and i realized i was getting walked on and said no after that i was a lot less helpful for a few years lol and ive been quite wary of being taken advantage of ever since its funny looking back because thats the year i turned into a little aries im moving into taurus next year,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was just thinking about this last night my boyfriend has some troublesome aspects like pluto square venus and i have a lot of 7th house aries placements from what hes told me about his younger self i dont think we would have gotten along very well at all if we were the same age and wed dated in our twenties hes fifteen years older than me though so he has been working through a lot of relationship stuff since before i was even dating age hes also a leo but by progressions hes a virgo which i love,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have venus mars lilith and mercury all in aries in the 7th house and i endorse this comment,YourFriendMaryGrace
libra rising 25 degrees,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have mars in aries best was with fellow fire mars people,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a cap moon and i have learned to embrace my rather mechanical structured approach to processing emotions i think it can actually be very helpful for working out problems with others or for helping people sort out their own feelings because the analytical skills i have for it help me break issues down to the root cause see how different feelings are interconnected etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
part of fortune is where you can find success so if its in capricorn in the 7th house maybe you find success by working hard alongside your significant other or a business partner,YourFriendMaryGrace
chiron is where youre wounded but can ultimately help others heal for example mine is in gemini in the 9th house and boy oh boy does that resonate i was raised with a very strong religious doctrine 9th house stuff but from a young age was having my own spiritual experiences that didnt jive with what i was being taught so talking about my own beliefs sharing what i learned on my own gemini stuff was a liability that would have led to being told that i was wrong a sinner etc which honestly still hurts all these years later i think part of my purpose is to be brave enough to share and in doing so help others feel free of religious constraints,YourFriendMaryGrace
lilith is a little more varied in interpretation some people say its the part of you that society rejects or a part of your life where you embrace darkness i would look at different articles about your specific placement of lilith and see what feels applicable,YourFriendMaryGrace
how did you determine which fated events were indicated by them by looking at transits or was it the symbology of the placements making it clear,YourFriendMaryGrace
internet word for small,YourFriendMaryGrace
youd rather die than live without compliments,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats crazy i have both the sun and saturn trine my mc what about you and yes im definitely used to making changes in my life some of the things ive been through just in the past year i never anticipated happening to me like a divorce sometimes i think that might be part of my growth process learning how to be stable and consistent and enjoy life despite seemingly never being able to be sure whatll happen next,YourFriendMaryGrace
yay how do you feel about your sunmoon combo i like it because i think the cap moon helps me stay grounded in reality and keeps the stereotypical pisces laziness under control but sometimes it feels like my feelings are overly filtered out because i wanna analyze them to death before i share them,YourFriendMaryGrace
well i definitely relate to my scorpio south node im oddly comfortable with crisis darkness and the idea of just burning it all down about 7 years ago i gave away almost everything i owned and drove out to the desert with no plan except to start over this was before i discovered astrology ha ha and it was right before my saturn return but i can see how it reflected both nodes kind of a south node reaction with north node intentions my mc is in cancer so that combined with my nn signhouse im wondering if my calling is at least in part to be a source of comfort and stability in other peoples time of crisis,YourFriendMaryGrace
what about you,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have nn in taurus in the 8th house which honestly feels kind of contradictory i can imagine that im meant to focus on taurean qualities like stability comfort followthrough and generally just enjoying life but the 8th house would seem to be the opposite of a lot of that,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces sun capricorn moon and libra rising we should be friends,YourFriendMaryGrace
did you also feel a libra risingesque fear of displeasing other people by admitting that youre told that youre pretty because i did and still do,YourFriendMaryGrace
libra rising and i think i am pretty in a very conventional sort of way none of my facial features stand out as exceptionally good or bad i just have good symmetry i guess im clumsy but that always surprises people once they notice because im told i seem like id be very graceful lol im 54 and weigh about 115lbs so fairly petite i think most of this is aligned with the standard libra rising description except for my height as ive read they tend to be taller than average,YourFriendMaryGrace
okay im not arguing with your data as ive yet to see it myself im just saying that your phrasing gives the impression that being gay is unfortunate and even if you dont care about hurting peoples feelings i think youll get a more productive discussion out of this post if you share what youve been researching in a more neutral less negative light,YourFriendMaryGrace
saturn just entered my 5th house like 2 weeks ago so my experience is very limited but i feel the sudden urge to buckle down and complete a short film i startedabandoned two years ago whereas new creative ideas arent really coming to me ive also been doing a lot of reflecting about what i really need in a romantic relationship and what im really willing to contribute another thing i think its interesting timing that im stuck with my children almost 247 right now because its made me more aware of what they individually need from me as their mom and a lot of it seems to involve me being more structured planning ahead better etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
hopefully you get some more responses im very interested in reading about this from people who have been through it,YourFriendMaryGrace
can you give some examples might want to change your wording too lol i think i get what you mean but saying risk of sounds like being gay is a disease or something,YourFriendMaryGrace
i assume she means venus in aries maybe venus in scorpio too if going by traditional rulerships,YourFriendMaryGrace
depends on what you need us to be,YourFriendMaryGrace
whats your rising sign im a libra rising venus in aries and my style is similar,YourFriendMaryGrace
what country do you live in,YourFriendMaryGrace

happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
same here and i was terrified to grow up i cried a lot when i was getting ready to turn 13 because i felt like i was gonna be a teen and not a kid anymore now im 35 and i guess ive accepted it but if i could be someones kid forever i would lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
listen to take a walk on the wild side first then listen to can i kick it and you cant possibly miss it,YourFriendMaryGrace
and a tiger saw a man,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats funny i had the same recurring dream as a newlywed i think sometimes our brains just run through alternate path scenarios via dreams and your emotions in the dream help you feel what making different choices might have felt like,YourFriendMaryGrace
you cant be serious lmao these are babies when i was this age i told my babysitter i was gonna cut off her head i wasnt a future murderer just a little kid copying what i heard disney villains say if you wanna predict adult personalities based on tiny childrens behavior youd have to come to the conclusion that theyre all gonna be psychopaths,YourFriendMaryGrace
thatd be great thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
trying to avoid unnecessary trips the grocery store plus having way more time than usual to spend in my back yard definitely has me veggie gardening,YourFriendMaryGrace
wish theyd reverse it turning churches into homes even temporarily would do a lot more to help the sick and the poor  you know the people jesus said to look after,YourFriendMaryGrace
no im kind of the opposite of that if they seem uninterested i lose interest too,YourFriendMaryGrace
capricorn moon in the 4th house im cleaning and organizing the shit out of my home and putting together a homeschool plan for my kindergarten and preschool age children,YourFriendMaryGrace

im here if you wanna talk,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know if youve ever been miserably sick with the flu before but posting on reddit was probably the last thing on everyones mind and regardless of whether or not the commenters here had covid19 maybe we did maybe we didnt its not at all surprising statistically that out of over a million subscribers half a dozen or so people would have had their worst flu ever in the past few months statistically it probably happened to way more than half a dozen doesnt make us liars just unlucky,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah just lifting a cup of water felt like a physical feat at the time,YourFriendMaryGrace

i was too out of it to post anything i honestly for the first time understood how otherwise healthy people could die from the flu but i think i wrote some texts about how at one point my fever reached 104 and i was sleeping so hard i wouldnt have even woken up to take medication if my ex hadnt stayed over to keep watch on me and  our kids and checked my forehead in the middle of the night,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit oh and i have texts that i sent to my dad a doctor about how to watch for pneumonia bc my kiddos breathing was sounding wheezy,YourFriendMaryGrace
interesting i definitely had the worst flu of my life in december and my children caught it and both had some difficulty breathing for a few days maybe a dumb question but would that give us immunity now if it was indeed the same thing,YourFriendMaryGrace
alright well i hope you enjoy the rest of your weekend lola,YourFriendMaryGrace
asking about specific placements isnt allowed here for some reason its okay on rastrologymemes and raskatrologers though if you wanna repost this,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think you might find this post and comments really helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
ahhh yeah that makes sense i think pisces can be a very childlike placement if its not balanced out with some strong earth or fire signs i have a lot of aries which helps and without it id probably be looking for guidance all the time in an effort to feel grounded,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats interesting i have mars and venus in aries both in the 7th house which makes me a little relationshipcrazy lol ive had to teach myself to be picky about who i date because if im not careful ill stick with people who arent actually good for me he has a lot of first house placements which do make him a little selffocused but hes definitely a relationship person his venus is in 7th as well and its actually been good for me to be with someone who has his own stuff going on because my pisces tendency to get lost in people is kind of kept at bay im more able to rememberfocus on my goals and personal activities as opposed to other relationships where i got so wrapped up in someone that i lost touch with myself all that to say pisces relationships might work better for you if shes able to accept your individuality and let it encourage her to focus on her own as well,YourFriendMaryGrace
id say trust your gut feeling pretty much regardless of placements,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for your loss youre a good sibling,YourFriendMaryGrace
you have a lot of signs and often times the sun sign is less relevant to the personality than others for example im a pisces but i have a shit ton of aries in my chart and it shows lol so a lot of the classic pisces descriptions lazy reserved a pushover dont describe me at all put your info in a birth chart calculator and youll get a lot more insight into yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes i have a bowl shaped chart and its said that people with this shape often feel incomplete as though the missing half of the chart is felt but not entirely accessible i only started studying astrology last year but looking back at the charts of people ive dated i see now that i have definitely been drawn to guys with heavy taurus gemini leo and virgo placements maybe in part because theyre bringing some of those energies to the table that i dont have a lot of on my own,YourFriendMaryGrace
definitely this has been going on for quite a few years think how many apps you have and how many of them could easily be listening with your permission per the terms and conditions,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love the 8th house its nothing to be scared of honestly yes it deals with death but also rebirth transformation contracts secrets sex etc if it makes you feel any better my 50 year old boyfriend has some of these placements and hes one of the most welladjusted and lucky mfers i know lol he does have quite a fascination with horror movies though,YourFriendMaryGrace
my saturn return was god awful although in hindsight of course i can see how myself and my life is much better because of those trials im at the end of my sade sati and its been really rough and just as lifechanging but not nearly as heartbreaking as the stuff i went through with saturn return,YourFriendMaryGrace
the flight attendant said i want this lady off my flight and then the woman started apologizing saying she was really stressed out etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
no worries i was actually responding to unettlepunk about his capricorn date,YourFriendMaryGrace
but re your post im dating a leo guy and id say your best bet is just hype him up with genuine compliments often and carry on like it never happened next time something embarrassing happens to you maybe tell him about it for laughs so he remembers embarrassing things happen to everyone,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces and i listened to under the bridge obsessively in high school so i could feel all the feels,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really want to know what happened now,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love this decoding my toddlers mystery phrases is one of my favorite things about having a toddler lol i felt like a genius when i finally figured out boocoos was blues clues lykeen was lightening mcqueen etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
he looks unwell but someone showed methis clip of him dancing with little kids and its pretty damn cute so im pulling for him,YourFriendMaryGrace
i can definitely understand taking issue with him as a psychiatrist proposing that conclusion but he is far from the only one the cia did some fascinating research on the topic of consciousness that particular link is a rather dense read but its really fun to ponder all the potential implications if youre into that kinda thing,YourFriendMaryGrace
first of all thanks for engaging in convo with me respectfully secondly im not looking to convince you or anyone to believe one way or the other i do want to say though that a lot of the children remembered random people who the parents couldnt have known about and in some cases they recalled correct details that were not publicly available information also for his consciousness theories he rely on theories of quantum physics quantum mechanics theories which is not the same as pseudoscience  but i acknowledge that the birthmarks could be coincidence some kids remembered incorrect details etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
again believe what feels right to you and be as skeptical as feels right to you im open to the idea of reincarnation but mostly in the camp of who the fuck can ever really know how this crazy universe works,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats a depressing yet empowering thought lol on the one hand i dont wanna be a bug but on the other hand now i feel like a badass for making it to the mammal level at least once fuck yeah im a mammal,YourFriendMaryGrace
lotta possibilities like maybe their past lives were on other planets or maybe not everyone is reincarnated or maybe our consciousness spends time elsewhere before returning to a physical body so theres not extra people right now just a lot more here at one time than usual,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit could also be that we reincarnate as creatures sometimes if so i would like to be a bear next time because annual hibernation sounds awesome,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think youd enjoy reading dr jim tuckers  research hes a actually continuing another u of virginia school of medicine psychiatristresearchers work dr ian stevenson so their combined collection of data from children who have past life memories spans decades most children lose these memories by age 7 or so theyve matched soooo many childrens memories with real life people its nuts interestingly most often the remembered deaths are traumatic or sudden in nature so lil suicide baby in the meme fits right in lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
just let him go i definitely understand the need for closure but some people just arent willing to have the conversation and hes pretty clearly unwilling you deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you so put your focus on that and try not to take it personally lots of great people out there will want exactly what you have to offer,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams of having a baby are usually to do with birthing a project or a part of yourself something like that similarly a miscarriage dream can be about something that you maybe planned on or started working on that ended for whatever reason but you were happy about it so if theres something you startedended around 2 months ago that you feel good about it ending its likely symbolizing that rather than an actual miscarriage,YourFriendMaryGrace
dream interpretation is tricky with strangers because you dont have any idea whats going on in the dreamers life and feelings that may be symbolized but hopefully that helps you get started,YourFriendMaryGrace
whenever youre listening youre really just quietly wondering how long until you can talk about yourself some more,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww yay no problem im so glad it was helpful best of luck to you and your boyfriend,YourFriendMaryGrace
i see what you mean now thank you for clarifying and youre right i dont disagree i just wanted to point out that there are more legit options than say costar for example and for someone like me and presumably op who still has a lot to learn its kind of nice to have something simple to start with,YourFriendMaryGrace
not all astrology apps are social media based and some of them are remarkably indepth timepassages has over 70 aspects just for my birth chart with most of the descriptions being multiple paragraphs long including less known aspects like biquintile and asteroids like juno their synastry is just as indepth but you do have to pay for the individual additional charts,YourFriendMaryGrace
you sound a lot like me and my boyfriend im a pisces sun cap moon and hes a leo sag moon its been about a year for us as well and we are really compatible if you can get the app timepassages and pay 99 cents for his chart youll be able to use their compare charts feature which is awesome the most thorough and accurate synastry reading ive found it spelled out what makes us compatible really well and even explains the challenges in a helpful hopeful way,YourFriendMaryGrace
heyyy you have the same placements as my little 3 year old boy got any parenting advice for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you can find out his birthdate you can find out his moon sign venus north node and more which will be far more helpful than going by the sun sign alone im a pisces with a leo boyfriend and those two signs are supposedly incompatible but its a really lovely relationship,YourFriendMaryGrace
for lent im giving up a little bit of work to work on my life,YourFriendMaryGrace
not a bad idea actually,YourFriendMaryGrace
nodal returns squares and reverses never miss me lol you can read the timing and descriptions here,YourFriendMaryGrace
i grew up in america but this one makes me sad too i feel like humans are meant to live in community and sharing taking care of each other but instead we isolate ourselves and just schedule time to not be alone once in a while,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces with a leo boyfriend sometimes our love languages arent exactly aligned like he loves spoiling me with gifts and taking me to nice restaurants and stuff which is very appreciated but id be just as happy smoking a bowl whilst wearing jammies and talking about our childhoods lol im a very affirming person though which works well with his need for praise and i love his physically affectionate nature our senses of humor are pretty compatible too i think if id met him earlier in my life i wouldnt have appreciated our differences nearly as much as i do now it took a long time for me to realize that being super similar to my partner doesnt actually work out too well for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit another interesting thing is that according to the synestry of some other placements we have we should be butting heads a lot and having to reign in our tempers but i have never had such a peaceful gentle relationship before and when we do have issues were able to talk a them out in a really empathetic and loving way which again may come down to having met at the right time,YourFriendMaryGrace
what was your experience like with this combo im a pisces and my baby daddy is an aries we have a 5 year old gemini and a 3 year old scorpio  i like to think our parenting styles provide a wellrounded balance but i dont know,YourFriendMaryGrace
pluto and saturn making squares oppositions and sextiles to practically everything in my chart lol basically the last two years have been an unending journey watching of everything i used to think would never change changing including my marriage got divorced this past summer doing my best to sit with the uncertainty of it all and trust that greater fulfillment and selfrealization are on the other side,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww lol they were giggling so much as they signed it i wondered if they were writing crazy stuff but i guess they were just happy to be signing it thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
this was sad but i enjoyed reading the details thank you for sharing if you dont mind sharing how do you feel about relationships in your current life,YourFriendMaryGrace
at a theater where artists are allowed to sign the walls backstage a bunch of teenage performers wrote this  and id love to know what it says,YourFriendMaryGrace
mr rogers for pisces sensitive gentle guy who lived to make people feel loved and empathized with he had a 29 pisces sun with moon mercury and venus in pisces too lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow til never really looked into these before but i just looked it up and  my life has definitely shifted dramatically right on schedule with these returnsreverse returns,YourFriendMaryGrace
no idea we lived there for 3 years and never heard anything like that before or after,YourFriendMaryGrace
birth chart and transit chart,YourFriendMaryGrace
so very grateful for any input at all i can offer dream interpretation in return,YourFriendMaryGrace
this happened to me and my ex one time when we were the only ones in the house two really loud knocks on the bathroom door,YourFriendMaryGrace
the only place i have gemini is my chiron but feel like i relate to gemini the most of any sign,YourFriendMaryGrace
could be my partners north node is my sun sign and we have the rare and exceptional pattern it specifically says that being together supports the person hes becoming,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a cap moonpisces sun and i feel things very strongly but i wont reveal my feelings until im ready which isnt often and i can only talk about my feelings to like  3 people and even then its usually after ive ruminated over it and tried to feel better on my own for a long time,YourFriendMaryGrace
i set mine for desired  nap length  approx how long i think it will take me to fall asleep  10 minutes because it always takes me longer than i think it will,YourFriendMaryGrace
i can relate as i have a pisces suncap moon but im learning to appreciate the beauty of being able to deeply empathize with people without getting swept up in whatever is going on with them and that i can have my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground at the same time,YourFriendMaryGrace
i would definitely pass on the message even if anonymously like usubfootlover suggested who knows maybe this message could spur an awakening in her that would lead her to change her ways,YourFriendMaryGrace
in my experience youll only remember the things youre ready to see i had a deeply uncomfortable feeling of dislike almost hatred for a very minor celebrity on a show i used to watch even though i had no conscious or logical reason why years later id mostly forgotten about him but then i started thinking about him again at random times and feeling so uncomfortable i tried past life regressions many times before eventually seeing flashes of a life in which he was my horrifically abusive uncle now of course that was not a fun thing to relive but it was actually really helpful for me in working through some issues i had around sex and relationships with men but if id remembered all that earlier i dont think i would have been ready whats interesting too is that i no longer feel that anger or dislike of him anymore at all  i actually find it comforting that hes evolved over his lifetimes and is now as far as i can tell a good guy weve probably all been horrible people in the past so whatever you learn from it know that it doesnt define you now,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry this happened to your girlfriend shes really lucky to have you in her corner,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think a lot of people are intimidated by those who march to the beat of their own drum because theyre unconsciously forced to confront their own conformity like were all incredibly unique at heart but when fitting in is your priority you suppress your own unique qualities and then resent the people who are able to let theirs show i hope that makes sense its something ive thought about a lot as ive dealt with it in my own way,YourFriendMaryGrace
keep doing you you sound awesome,YourFriendMaryGrace
costar powered by pretentious delusional robots,YourFriendMaryGrace
i got caught in that cycle for a while when i was young i didnt have enough selfrespect to leave him but i had enough strength not to do what he said of course its shitty but some people just repeating what they see normalized and havent learned how much better and different a relationship can be,YourFriendMaryGrace
my brain went to the same place and i liked it,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have taurus in my 8th house as well as ceres in taurus in the 8th,YourFriendMaryGrace
what confuses me is that my north node is taurus in the 8th house and the descriptions of having a taurus nn is basically the opposite of the 8th house nn description am i supposed to be embracing comfort and stability or learning to live without it,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry you lost your son,YourFriendMaryGrace
readingrpastlives might make you feel better,YourFriendMaryGrace
my venus is in aries and ive never related to the falls in and out of love quickly thing if i commit to someone its because im hoping it lasts forever my venus is retrograde though so that may have some impact,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww well needless to say im a big sag moon fan and yeah the needing space thing took some getting used to because i felt rejected at first but that didnt stop me because my aries venusmars loves the chase lol just curious but have you ever lived with a partner before and how do you handle your need for alone time,YourFriendMaryGrace
my two most significant relationships including my ex who i was with for 12 years have been with guys who had a sag moon in the 1st house from my perspective their common themes are loyalty and a deep deep need for autonomy and freedom also both have a very funloving nature,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you i can tell just by looking at you that youre a kind person and i bet youre fun to hang out with too keep being awesome the world needs more people like you,YourFriendMaryGrace
ill believe you you might enjoy checking out rprecognition,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so weird but ive read similar stories before so youre not alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
what time was it before you blinked vs after,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so beautiful,YourFriendMaryGrace
no prob im glad it was helpful the collective unconscious fascinates me too i started learning about it when i was studying dream interpretation and how our subconscious minds use similar themes water  emotions for example in dreams to illustrate our deeper feelings i think that and probably many other influences numerical astrological etc probably play a big role in these types of persontoperson coincidences which arent actually coincidental at all,YourFriendMaryGrace
take your kiddos with you i drove mine to randomly generated spot in the middle of a suburban neighborhood and there were like 10 deer ambling around it was wild and they loved it never know what you might see,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont have an explanation but id say definitely keep in touch with him you can keep it light and casual and see where it goes maybe youve found each other for a reason if nothing else you know youve got a kindred spirit out there and thats always a blessing in itself,YourFriendMaryGrace
if its a metaphorical dream he probably represents a part of yourself that youd like to get reacquainted with or theres something about him that youd like to be more like think about his qualities and if theres anything about him you particularly admired could also be a glimpse into an alternate timeline,YourFriendMaryGrace
as a latenights working mom of a 3 and 5 year old quiet time is vital to my sanity lol just having even fifteen minutes or so to myself really helps me regroup and keep going,YourFriendMaryGrace
what did she keep in there,YourFriendMaryGrace
kenan,YourFriendMaryGrace
good morning you sexy beast,YourFriendMaryGrace
maybe but im glad you did i think i the way i worded that question was a little more bleak than i intended and i agree with you im still healing but its a process of getting happier and happier  and a lot of my healing has happened through metaphorical dreams like these because they help me identify what im feeling on an unconscious level which is why your question caught my eye thank you for the thoughtful response,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you also feel like you went through hard times that dramatically decreased your capacity for joy to this day because thats where i think my shitty disney world dreams come from,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have recurring locations but what happens there varies theres a ridiculously large mostly empty church that i wander around in sometimes a postapocalyptic disney world where everything is shitty and unsafe but its the best we can do,YourFriendMaryGrace
i only date people who are mature enough to value the content of someones character over the color of their skin,YourFriendMaryGrace
one of the past life memories i have is of being a woman who died in the 1960s with no spiritualreligious beliefs at all i floated above my hospital bed and just kind of hovered there for a long time before i realized that i wasnt obligated to stay in the room with my body lol after that i zipped around the world and saw things id always wanted to see like the eiffel tower before eventually making my way up to the clouds and beyond to start the betweenlives process which is a long way of saying that i think some souls need time to process the experience of not having a body or they simply arent ready to cross over because of fear or the feeling of unfinished business in this realm and thats probably where a lot of ghost sightings come from,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit i dont attribute all spiritual entities to this sort of thing though i think energy good and bad can manifest in this realm all kinds of ways and theres probably an untold number of extradimensional beings passing through at any given time that we cant fully perceive on this planet,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps i was raised christian as well welcome to the wonderful world of following your own path wherever it may take you,YourFriendMaryGrace
a shuttle cock for bad mitten sounds like the title of a whimsical porn written by a childrens book author,YourFriendMaryGrace
my boyfriend has never said i love you to me even though ive said it to him many times hes incredibly kind and affectionate and generous and thoughtful which makes me  feel loved but not hearing it is really starting to hurt,YourFriendMaryGrace
i wrote about mine here,YourFriendMaryGrace
i went to school with someone who is getting fairly well known as a comedian a few people found her annoying but most people including me thought she was funny i guess its still a little surprising just because so few people actually make it in the entertainment industry and she did it,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think the idea that anyone can be a bad dancer is silly just move your body in whatever way feels good to you whether alone or with people those who make fun probably just wish they were brave enough to dance,YourFriendMaryGrace
its never too late to turn things around geraldo,YourFriendMaryGrace
i said no one of either gender should be forced into killing being killed didnt expect  that to be an offensive statement,YourFriendMaryGrace
how about the kind of equality where no one of either gender gets forced into killingbeing killed on behalf of some rich dudes,YourFriendMaryGrace
my moon is in capricorn and i feel like im good at stepping up to the plate for other people not so much for myself lol definitely feel guilty about my irresponsibility on a daily basis but guilt doesnt seem to motivate me so im trying to be more selfaffirming,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes been getting a normal amount of sleep at night yet feeling desperate for naps and caffeine just to get through the day way more dreams than usual too,YourFriendMaryGrace
this article is really fascinating to me they talk extensively about the pole shift and estimate the number of smaller circular structures similar to this one to be in the millions but for more indepth reading you might find this and this interesting english explorers who discovered the ruins in the late 1800s found it inhabited as is illustrated in the picture i linked above and documented some of the things locals said about it,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think it would be super awkward at first and yes painful for a while but personally i believe the vast majority of people are really good at heart and so much of the pain we cause each other is really because we ourselves are confused afraid and hurting and that telepathy would ultimately bring us closer together in a new way because wed be able to feel the pain thats causing people to act the way they do and maybe even inherently understand the source of their pain and the feeling of being understood and empathized with would change peoples lives for the better i think thered still be factions but it would be a much more massive yet simpler twosided one of good vs evil instead of the everymanforhimself sort of world we live in now but im just speculating of course,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for reading i have had mixed results sharing this with people in real life so its nice to be able to talk about it and not feel like im coming across as crazy haha its weird i feel a deep sense of tragedy and loss looking at pictures of the ruins and if really it was an accident that shifted the poles and caused us to lose telepathy that really would be a great tragedy to be able to communicate and empathize seamlessly and effortlessly and then suddenly everything changes for everybody in an instant and nobody understands why misunderstandings uncertainty about peoples motivations and so much more would be a problem for the first time and our resulting sense of being alone in the world would be so painful to experience all at once and if that is what happened it makes sense that there would be factions and people would start splitting up into tribes and inventing their own way of communicating like in the story of the tower of babel,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit another interesting thing about these ruins is that theyve discovered hundreds of much smaller versions of it covering a wide area around it as though the people who built it were experimenting and working their way up to the big one and it doesnt make sense as a fortress or city walls or a place for livestock or really any of the things we associate with ancient human lifestyles,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have past life memories and by far the most vivid one is of being shown the footprint of a massive structure and understanding something similar to what youre saying except the languages came to exist because of a sudden loss of telepathic abilities as a child i would see the shape of this structures footprint everywhere in clouds popcorn ceilings the floral pattern of my bedding and it drove me crazy because i couldnt put into words what it was and how i recognized it then a few years ago i ran across this image of the footprint of the great zimbabwe ruins  and it stopped me in my tracks because its the exact same shape ive remembered my whole life then i started reading more about the legends surrounding it and it sounds an awful lot like the tower of babel theres even theories about it being some sort of natural energy producing mechanism that was just too big and too powerful and the people who built it ended up accidentally shifting the magnetic poles which could indeed affect the way our brain computers link up anyway i could go on and on but its a fascinating rabbit hole to fall down for sure,YourFriendMaryGrace
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace

i wanna see,YourFriendMaryGrace
as you grow and evolve youll take on characteristics of the sign following your natal sun for example im a pisces sun and i still have many of those characteristics but ive been a progressed aries sun since childhood and i relate to that because i had to learn to be more independent and assertive than the typical pisces at a young age,YourFriendMaryGrace
who always has their dms open if you need someone to talk to,YourFriendMaryGrace
not at all everyone needs to feel wanted and loved i hope you find someone who appreciates you for you really soon,YourFriendMaryGrace
speaking with kindness hearing them out and acknowledging their feelingsperspective even if i disagree and sharing my own feelingsperspective without insisting that my way of thinking about it is the only correct way basically i make every effort to have a polite discussion rather than an argument and by doing so i find that its far more likely to go my way and even if we stay on different pages the relationship can usually carry on just fine,YourFriendMaryGrace
i am,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
just call it a leg injury and reduce your recovery time by two weeks,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww thank you very much for saying that my man i hope you have a great day too,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre awesome thank you for chatting with me about this i agree with you that the media is pushing it pretty hard and as someone who has  almost zero trust in the media i do have to question why but at the end of the day i think its a good thing for kids to feel free to explore the world around them without having to deal with all the cultural input theyll be dealing with the rest of their lives and if this kind of thing helps parents feel better about itnot read into it too much i think thats great,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway thanks again it says a lot about you that youd earnestly consider the other side and be willing to change your way of looking at it the world would be a much better place if more people were brave enough to do that i have to work on it myself all the time,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive read all your comments here and im not a fan of arguing id like to understand your side i dont get it yet but im trying it seems youre okay with your son consciously choosing to dress as a woman once hes old enough to understand that what hes wearing will be perceived as feminine and good for you i think thats great what i dont understand is why youre not okay with a little dude playing dress up before hes old enough to have picked up on all the culturalgendered associations isnt that inherently more pure in intention its like you want to teach him its not okay but then be cool about it if he does it anyway which in my personal opinion is kinda sad because then hell only be able to express himself with the knowledge that hes going against what his parents have taught him is acceptable,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a transgender friend who still gets emotional talking about the time as a child when they said they wanted to wear a waitress costume and their parents laughed at them and said no thats for girls it was the beginning of a 20 year long shameridden hide out in the closet until they were finally able to even think about expressing their femininity again and they still arent close with their parents statistically the odds that one of my kids will be transgender gay etc is low but regardless id so much rather be supportive of them wearing what they like than set up a precedent where they feel like they have to audit their choices based on my personal feelings as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i dont see any reason to get picky,YourFriendMaryGrace
if a little boy wants to wear a dress its got nothing to do with their sexuality and everything to do with wanting to look like a character they enjoy my 3 year old boy likes to put my makeup on sometimes bc mommy does it and its colorful sparkly shit that can go on your face all of which appeals to his toddler sensibilities assuming that makes him gaytranswhatever would be idiotic,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hear you on the first point but you cant just lock your door and keep sleeping when your kids wake up early unless theyre old enough to be unsupervised which takes years,YourFriendMaryGrace

i am my day job i work with artists but not doing art myself but ive been painting for a few years and sell them sometimes ultimately i want to be a filmmaker too im learning how to animate and id like to make short films what about you,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh thank you that made me smile and youre welcome please feel free to reach out any time you have a dream youd like some help figuring out of course youre the best interpreter of your dreams because youre living the experiences that lead up to having them but it always seems to help me having someone readhear mine and tell me what sticks out to them i used to have chronic nightmares as well and learning how to understand what my brain was trying to sort outtell me made a huge difference i also usually google the setting and such for common interpretations which helps like last night i had a dream that took place in a stadium and i was on a computer trying to animate i read that dreaming youre in a stadium can mean that you are trying to be more assertive and put yourself out there more which sure enough is what im trying to do with my art so it makes sense,YourFriendMaryGrace
interesting im a pisces sun cap moon and an infj makes sense since infj are known for their empathetic yet emotionally reserved ways,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh yeah i know but it still might be relevant since the description of the metaphor strangulation  stifled emotions aggression kinda fits with your description of the dog having to be kept in the garden due to being aggressive with certain people im sorry it made you feel horrible bad dreams can be really upsetting i would interpret that as your minds way of telling you that whatever the dog represents be it stifling your emotions or something else its a valuable part of yourself that you should protect no part of ourselves are ever really killed forever they just get pushed back or forgotten but theyre still there and you can nurture them,YourFriendMaryGrace
it might be worth a try to ask yourself what the dog represents before going to bed tonight i do that sometimes and will get a new dream that illustrates it differently,YourFriendMaryGrace
hmm thats interesting i googled the meaning of dreams about strangulation and this came up,YourFriendMaryGrace
in dreams the feeling of being strangled suggests a deliberate act of suppression strangulation suggests a violent act of suppression emotionally our more violent aggressive side may not allow us to act appropriately in certain situations  to dream of strangling someone is an attempt to stifle our own emotions,YourFriendMaryGrace
maybe something in your life has made you feel like you were too aggressive or said too much or like you had to stifle your emotional responses that might explain why your brain chose that dog specifically for this dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
possibly but that someone could also be you the subconscious usually creates a character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so sometimes you are all the elements of the dream do you remember any more details like how the dog was killed how would you describe your cousins dogs personality irl,YourFriendMaryGrace
animals often represent a vulnerable part of yourself it might help to think about it metaphorically and whether you might feel like youve lost a part of your personality,YourFriendMaryGrace
mars in aries here too and same,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces woman with a leo man i like our differences for the most part the biggest hurdle probably had to do with his sag moon though he doesnt like to talk about feelings until theres a problem and i could talk about feelings all day lol but ive learned to appreciate his love language of making fun plans and helping me with stuff instead of expecting him to express it my way,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you look in the shared experiences section of a particular pattern some of the comments may tell you what its based on a lot of things seem to be based on the rising signmc,YourFriendMaryGrace
is your rahu different from the north node my western north node is in taurus but if i do a vedic chart i get aries rahu,YourFriendMaryGrace
me,YourFriendMaryGrace
heres what its like for me personally,YourFriendMaryGrace
the cons too much of my self esteem is tied up in feeling accomplished i have an emotion and then i immediately feel compelled to ignore it categorize it explain it away or feel bad for feeling it in the first place lol i rarely get comfortable just  feeling i spend a lot more energy thinking about what i should and shouldnt feel,YourFriendMaryGrace
the pros  it overrides a lot of the less helpful pisces sun traits like laziness lack of boundless and so on also makes me popular with employers as i have a very overpowering urge to work hard edit to add i like to think that as i continue to learn how to accept and integrate what im feeling it will be even more of an asset i hope i can learn to use my pisces empathy and my libra social skills combined with cap moon stoic side to be a port in the storm for others,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks so much and btw if youre ever interested in reading professionally id love to be a client just read your kim post and its fascinating,YourFriendMaryGrace

well you sound like a good parent to me and i appreciate that we were able to chat about our different perspectives without it turning into a pointless fight all the best to you and your family,YourFriendMaryGrace
wanting to wear someone elses clothes sure sounds like creatively experimenting to me obviously well have to agree to disagree here and thats fine but my belief is at least partially formed by experiences like when i sat across the table from a gay friend of mine last year and held his hand as he cried about the time when he was 4 years old and his conservative manly man dad made him feel ashamed for wanting to buy a barbie hes 30 years old and that shit still hurts another friend who is trans has memories of being laughed at by his parents for wanting to wear a waitress costume these parents didnt raise manlier boys by censoring their interestsexperimentation they raised boys who grew up to feel like their true selves werent good enough for their parents,YourFriendMaryGrace
im not saying youd do these things just explaining why i dont want to be the person who makes my kids feel bad about experimenting and liking what they like theyll get plenty of that from the rest of the world and when that happens ive got their back,YourFriendMaryGrace
i get you i was just responding to the other persons question of why not and i get your reason for saying no in your case but yes id let him wear his sisters clothes to school if thats what he wanted to do and she didnt mind hes only 3 but hes worn her shirt with the hearts on it out and about before lil homie just really likes hearts as long as theyre safe and not hurting anybody i try and let them figure out what they like without putting my personal feelings and bias in the mix,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have kids and i let my son wear his sisters pajamas lol theyre the same size and she doesnt mind he likes them so yeah why not,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think its all pretty much done by ai like they have certain plugin phrases for planetsignhouseaspects and the robots then string sentences together based on your transits for example my moon is in capricorn in the 4th house and my venus is in aries in the 7th house so when theres a transit happening with my moon and venus it might say something like explore what happens when you allow your sturdy emotional connection with home and family to recharge your energy for significant relationships sometimes its eerily helpful and accurate sometimes its just word salad,YourFriendMaryGrace
kids will be petty no matter what you do though id rather teach my kids to express themselves in spite of the occasional negative feedback than teach them to try and fit in my 3 year old son likes fire trucks and digging in the dirt and stuff but he also likes having his nails painted different colors he studies his options carefully and usually picks specific colors for specific fingers its cute but if later on he stops wanting to do it ill be cool with it i think theres a balance between encouraging them to be themselves and forcing them to buck the trend all the time i hope i get it right but im far from the perfect parent,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so awesome youre definitely not alone i wasnt feeling well and didnt have the best experience last night in particular but generally i find the days before during and after a new moon and full moon to be extra beneficial for that kind of inner healing,YourFriendMaryGrace
libra rising with a lot of aries and scorpio im petite like 53 and 110lbs dark curly hair which i usually have as a pixie cut or a kind of mop top lol big brown eyes small nose often told i look like a fairy,YourFriendMaryGrace
libra rising and this moon is transiting my 8th house also my north node is taurus in the 8th house im thinking about my future a lot what will truly make me feel happy and comfortable im also feeling a strong urge to examine my inner self and what my actual wantsneeds are vs what i feel like i should wantneed my moon is in capricorn so i dont often get the urge to just let myself feel what i feel riding the wave while i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
full moons are great for releasing think about yourself as a cup and the feeling of heaviness as a symptom of being too full what behaviors fears thought patterns etc are you ready to release,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit the moon is in taurus so you can work with the energy of this specific full moon by also thinking about your five senses and indulging in pleasure take a long bath eat something yummy listen to beautiful music etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
no worries at all just wanted to offer i bet youll find the perfect deck in no time i dont use tarot myself but ive enjoyed getting readings so if you ever want to practice on someone lemme know,YourFriendMaryGrace
well they say your first deck should be given to you if youre comfortable sharing a mailing address with me send me a pm id love to gift you a deck from amazon if not no worries ive seen them in stores that sell games and any crystal or magick shop should have them,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so cool you gotta do it keep me posted if you have time,YourFriendMaryGrace
second house is in scorpio with saturn in scorpio and uranus in sagittarius there as well i dont know what im good at but it sure isnt makingkeeping money interestingly my south node is in scorpio in the 2nd house using whole sign so it seems i should be able to overcome this but idk im still pretty new to astrology,YourFriendMaryGrace
its cool you had this dream so close to todays date of 1111 i typically read dreams metaphorically but this one might be worth looking into literally get yourself some tarot cards and learn how to read even if its just for fun,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for your loss i hope things look up for you as the days go by be patient with yourself im sure you know this but the grieving process takes time  im always here for you if you want to chat,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have the exact same placements and disposition,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats sounds about right the circumstances of my childhood made me feel like i had to be very stoic and cheerful especially around my mom shes in a much better place now and our relationship is good so i forget how much that probably still affects me subconsciously,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think of cancer like a mama bear looks very cuddly and sweet likes to hibernate but holy shit dont mess with her or her loved ones im mostly basing this on my own mama bear who is a lovely very badass cancer and my cancer granddad who was the same way im a pisces sun with a lot of scorpio and while i have some great qualities from those placements sometimes i think theyre less practicalhelpful in the outside world than cancer qualities,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh thats really interesting my south node is in scorpio and my life came crashing down at age 27  i went full scorpio lol and basically expedited the burnitdown process myself so i could move on to rebuilding and i had a pretty major epiphany that could be called a spiritual awakening it was a rough time in my life but im thankful for it now everything i lost was just stuff id built trying to please or impress other people,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh man i totally do that lol for me its usually because something ive been ignoringsuppressing with various distraction tactics has suddenly bubbled up to the surface and i cant get it out of my mind and because i dont like to talk about my feelings until ive had time to process them alone i end up sitting there unable to pretend nothing is wrong and unable to talk about what is wrong its awkward,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit you can help by not forcing them to talk about it just let them know youre there if they want to talk,YourFriendMaryGrace
capricorn moon i was just reading about it this placement this morning actually bc im 34 and i still dont understand my own emotions very well,YourFriendMaryGrace
id say that it applies to my current career in a sense my midheaven is in cancer and i work with a lot of emotionally sensitive people a nurturing personality isnt required for my job but it sure helps ultimately id like to be an artist fulltime and i can see how my art might take on some cancerlike qualities eventually right now its very scorpio though,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow thats awesome i cant think of a more appropriate profession based on your sunrising empathetic yet very comfortable with death,YourFriendMaryGrace
re the bowl shape i find it confusing because some of the information i read seemed to indicate that the best way to move forward in life would be to work counterclockwise starting with the first empty area which would be taurus8th house others seemed to be saying that sorting out the saturnscorpio 2nd house stuff would be the biggest factor,YourFriendMaryGrace
re the aries at 29 degrees in the 7th house i feel confused about what it means i got married too young and i still struggle with the balance between being myself and going for what i want vs truly merging with another person and my north node is in the 7th house so i feel like this is important to figure out edit i forgot that i used whole sign for this chart which puts my north node in the 8th house,YourFriendMaryGrace
and finally my progressed sun hits 29 degrees in aries next march which feels significant heres a pic of my progressed chart for that date in case its helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
any help or insight suggestions etc with any of the above would be hugely appreciated,YourFriendMaryGrace
go for it i like to learn,YourFriendMaryGrace
what charity,YourFriendMaryGrace
why should i move my backpack off the one empty seat left on the bus when youre capable of standing why should i not be a murderer we all do a lot of things because its the right thing to do why do you want the people who run companies to be an exception so bad,YourFriendMaryGrace
im glad you mentioned infrastructure because its a great example of what im saying pipelayers provide an incredibly valuable service and the work is difficult af starting pay is about 24000 a year does that seem fair to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah it would be dumb because bench pressing cars has no value getting the food i ordered in mere minutes does and just because people arent properly compensated for doing difficult work doesnt mean they shouldnt be,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you have a dog capable of standing up for hours at a time in a hot kitchen keeping track of multiple orders at a time busting ass to collect bag each order in well under 5 minutes interacting with customers many of whom are unpleasant working with computer systemscash registers and making correct change you should get that dog a tv show,YourFriendMaryGrace
ill never understand why people think working at mcdonalds is easy i get tired just watching them,YourFriendMaryGrace
because the white car ended up on top of the red truck that tried to pull it out of the water i think,YourFriendMaryGrace
im no expert but i think thats more of a synastry question specifically where you have placements in each others 5th house maybe 4th house too,YourFriendMaryGrace
go to astro seek or horoscope yourself websites and make a birth chart using that info,YourFriendMaryGrace
lol my 5 year old has been a demanding lil punk all morning i was just telling her that she should try being positive and encouraging more often if she wants people to care enough to cooperate with her this video couldnt have come at a better time,YourFriendMaryGrace
the night i met my boyfriend he had an astounding number of conjunctions happening with his natal venus and his north node was parallel his sun sign which is kinda cool because his north node is my sun sign,YourFriendMaryGrace
mars in aries 7th house,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think just about everybody does that in one way or another,YourFriendMaryGrace
driving in a dream usually symbolizes the way your life is going so the fact that youre the one driving and nothing scary happens is a great sign probably indicates that you feel in control of your life people who are stressed about life circumstances often dream theyre driving a car with no brakes for example it being your dads car probably symbolizes having to do some things your dads way or with his permission which makes sense given your age just my perspective take it with a grain of salt,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh thats interesting sometimes i think i might be projecting and its actually me that keeps us from talking about stuff lol i feel self conscious because my circumstances at present are keeping us from being able to progress at any rate its nice to hear that sag moons are capable of getting excited about commitment  the stereotype is so bleak when it comes to sags and commitment,YourFriendMaryGrace
my boyfriend has the same placements and this describes him to a t im curious though how do you feel about talking about the future with regards to relationships hes a sag moonasc so maybe that plays into it but hell talk my ear off about nearly everything  but  the relationship even though all the other things he says and does point to him being as committed if not more so than me,YourFriendMaryGrace
hahaha thats a perfect nickname im a pisces sun so we probably have a lot of the same tendencies i have dreams where im leading a goth girl army whose weapon of choice is literal fireflies flies that zoom into buildings and burst into flames then another part of me dressed in white swoops in and saves the people i like so clearly theres a subconscious conflict within me between wanting to help everyone and wanting to watch it all burn to the ground lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a libra rising with pluto in scorpio in the 1st house i make a very cheerful feminine first impression and then people seem surprised when im very comfortable with the darksexualtaboo sides of life i also have very dark brown eyes,YourFriendMaryGrace
its 6 people standing with their arms in the air look at the black space between the womens legs as tall skinny women in a dress and the vulva is a neckhead once you see them youll see two men in between them and men on the far left and right sides,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have costar and use it as a quick reference point sometimes but astroseek is a lot more detailed and will give you more information such as your north and south nodes which imo are some of the most helpful things to know about yourself but i definitely recommend supplementing your knowledge by googling stuff no app or website really covers everything time passages is another great app btw,YourFriendMaryGrace
google venus in aries and read some articles then google venus in the 5th house and read some more the combination of what you read will give you a fuller picture,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit astroseek gives birth charts that include interpretation of both house and sign but its usually a very brief description,YourFriendMaryGrace
from what i can tell it can cause people to be extremely cautious about entering a relationship or even having sex i was in my 20s before i had sex and in my 30s before i had sex with someone else from what i understand thats not uncommon with venus retrograde people i really like sex id just rather be celibate than be intimate with someone i dont feel a strong connection with this thread might be helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
science is not a belief system it does not rely on hopes and dreams,YourFriendMaryGrace
i completely agree with you which is why im sharing scientific research with you instead of my hopes and dreams i have no idea whether or not pluto or the apparent retrograde  of planets etc affects us neither do you but thanks to decades of research we can say with mathematical certainty that the cycles of the moon as well as some of the inner planets do in fact affect us i dont think you were expecting that so youre pretending like im linking you to pictures of voodoo dolls burning in sage piles rather than engaging with what ive actually written,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also agree with you that clinging to beliefs is antiscience which is why its disappointing to see you clinging to your belief that planets have no effect on us despite being shown hard data indicating that some of them do i linked you to properly scientifically conducted research on the topic of planetary effects on humans hoping to have a cordial sciencebased discussion  it seems youre more interested in being insulting im not insulted but it feels like you want me to be and arguing against a meme that im in no way trying to defend so i dont really know how to engage with you now arguing on the internet just isnt my thing but lemme know if you ever feel like discussing research and the implications of the results,YourFriendMaryGrace
btw i checked out your music and youre very talented i also work in film and i used to live in ocean beach,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you believe in science and i suspect that you do then approach this scientifically and see if the evidence supports your hypothesis you stated earlier that the planets moon etc do not affect personality life experiences etc conveniently this is by definition a null hypothesis which means that nearly all the research found here applies to your hypothesis statistically significant meaning that mathematically speaking the correlations cannot be attributed to random chance  evidence rejects this null hypothesis which as scientific research usually does brings up a whole slew of new questions youve already listed some really great ones in the comment im replying to now which is why its a bummer to see you close by restating your belief that its all silly and nonsensical rather than examining the evidence and seeking the answers to your own questions asking questions and examining the evidence is the best approach we humans have for learning about our universe the idea that the earth revolves around the sun was once considered silly and nonsensical too but naturally the scientists of the time kept asking questions and examining the evidence and found it to be true,YourFriendMaryGrace
and fwiw i do understand where youre coming from im 34 years old and up until may of this year i believed that astrology was a bunch of make believe woowoo nonsense and to be fair the socalled astrology seen in memes and pop culture very often is made up written by people who arent even using astrological methods to back their claims but when i ran across an article citing scientifically conducted studies showing that ancient astrological methods can be used to predict certain human behaviors and experiences to a statistically significant degree i had to accept that i might be wrong of course you are fully entitled to your beliefs and fully entitled to disregard any evidence contradictory to your beliefs but theres a lot to be said for keeping an open curious mind without open curious minds there would be no scientists,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams are often metaphorical but this one might be a little more straightforward perhaps youve been thinking even just hypothetically about having sex and what the ramifications would be in a worst case scenario or maybe youre trying to separate your true feelings about sex from how your parents raised you to think about it just my perspective may or may not be true for you fwiw i grew up in the same kind of household and it took me a while to let go of the guiltshamefears i had about sex but ultimately these types of dreams are helpful and probably a good sign that youre letting go of some obstacles to being yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
well now youre just being obtuse lol my second link has a long list of statistically significant data on the effects of not just the moon but many of the other planets everything is cited and you can even read many of the studies yourself and see the data if you just feel like arguing knock yourself out but calling research done by phds using blind studies and scientific methods of measurement voodoo makes no sense,YourFriendMaryGrace
in no way does it effect humans emotions or personalities or life experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
theres an awful lot of statistically significant data suggesting otherwise heres a very small collection of examples  and more here but theres lots more out there if youre interested,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you for saying that i hope it helps someone im very glad youre still here,YourFriendMaryGrace
this made me sad im sorry your parents reacted like that when what you needed  was empathy and support,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope you feel better soon,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is so cool i cant wait to try it thank you for sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
it could be a reflection of how you feel youre currently progressing through life for example when people are feeling good where theyre going in life they might dream of driving a nice car down a beautiful road or flying in an airplane lately ive been dreaming of being in a car thats out of control with no brakes so youre not alone lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace
see  for more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
can you think of anything in your life lately that youve killed it could be a relationship an idea you decided not to pursue a part of yourself that youve suppressed or even someone whos feelings you hurt the fact that you did it without thinking but felt bad afterwards is probably a helpful clue,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry to hear that,YourFriendMaryGrace
same here and i dont relate to the typical venus in aries description very much im extremely choosy about who i have sex with and rather than lose interest quickly as venus in aries supposedly do ill stick around way longer than is healthy for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
in answer to your question op i think i interact fairly normally but under the surface im a bundle of insecurities for the beginning of the relationship and even once im settled in i have an underlying fear im not good enough ive come a long way but i still need fairly regular reassurance from my partner,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats actually an urban legend and not at all based in factual evidence the universe and i have arrived at the conclusion that youre a six foot tall pile of awesome,YourFriendMaryGrace
i would love that someone posted a dream here like a year ago where aliens invaded and created a test to determine whether she was a real human or an alien in disguise it said what did you do last summer yes or no and she was sweating it out trying to guess what the aliens thought a human would respond that needs to be a meme i still laugh when i think about it,YourFriendMaryGrace
im glad it was helpful and congrats on making big strides forward,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a straight woman and im not even on tinder but samantha has the power to change all that,YourFriendMaryGrace
definitely start keeping a dream journal it will help you start remembering them with way more clarity also check out rprecognition youre not alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
the profile pic in my dream was a little different her pose was less sassy and more fml with her shoulders slouching arms down and she was frowning but i could only find so many options for images of women in coveralls,YourFriendMaryGrace
isnt it crazy i only discovered the nodes a few months ago and i was amazed as my north node is precisely what i had realized that i needed to cultivate in myself earlier this year i showed a friend of mine how to look up his and he had the same reaction best of luck to you we got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
driving  your life path the dream with your high school friends might have been about the path you were on back then,YourFriendMaryGrace
bridge  connection between things so it could be pastpresent and future for example where an unfinished bridge represents an uncertain future or unclear path to get what you want,YourFriendMaryGrace
busbus station  public aspect of your life journey or the parts of your life that you have less control over,YourFriendMaryGrace
these are just some possible metaphors to consider dreams are usually little stories we tell ourselves to illustrate how we feel so think about the feelings in the dreams and what they might represent for you personally like the fear of heights you have in the dreams might represent a fear you have about falling or losing control in some aspect of your real life right now,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
normally i default to the metaphorical method of dream interpretation but this is one of those dreams that feels more spiritualenergy related to me i do think its relevant that youre doing emdr therapy right now if i had to guess id say that youre probably ridding yourself of some yucky energy that accumulated in the time you lived in that house and the therapy is bringing it to the surface to be dealt with so while im sure it was awfully scary its probably a sign of progress renergywork might be a good resource for releasing it just remember that youre safe and in control,YourFriendMaryGrace
would you mind recommending a website ive tried astroseek and the timepassages app but neither of them seem to include north node in their synastry interpretations the person im seeing now his north node is my sun sign which id think would be a good thing but im an astrology newb,YourFriendMaryGrace
how can you tell that hes activating your north node,YourFriendMaryGrace
your sister and i have the same sunmoon placements i agree about the pushover stereotype i think its because pisces are intuitive enough to recognize why someone is behaving badly and empathetic enough to give them a pass if they feel like it like if someone is going off on me about some trivial thing i can see that theyre actually stressedangry about something that has nothing to do with me and it makes me feel like figuring out whats actually bothering them more than getting defensive so from an outside perspective it looks like im just incapable of standing up for myself when actually its a conscious choice to let them off the hook and see if i can help my mars is in aries though so im fully equipped with a temper lol it just doesnt flare up easily,YourFriendMaryGrace
or to run away from peoplerelationships if you feel pressure to conform to circumstances or the partner i love aquarius so i think thats a nice placement however,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh snap thats definitely me i can hang in there for a while i just ended a 12 year marriage that i was mentally ready to leave 6 years ago but i feel very claustrophobic when a partner expects to have a lot of sway in my decisions im still trying to figure out whats fair in that regard,YourFriendMaryGrace
and i love leos btw i have no leo in my chart and i wish i did theres just a cheerful magnetism in the leos i know that draws me in like a moth to a flame lol im currently seeing a leo sunsag moon which seems to be working out well in that he needs his freedom and respects mine the lack of communication is trying though,YourFriendMaryGrace
secondary characters often represent parts of your psyche that arent fully integrated sex kissing etc often represents the integration or merging of this part of yourself into the whole so for example if youve been working on being more assertive your subconscious might illustrate that with a dream like this thats just one possibility to consider you can try asking yourself what the man represents as you fall asleep and it may be illustrated in a different way with a new dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
my jupiter is in aquarius in the 4th house of all my placements ive probably looked into that one the least im still not sure how it manifests in my life my venus is in the 6th house and opposite the ascendant within 35 degrees according to timepassages would that be considered wiggle room mars opposite ascendant within 45 degrees i dont relate to the venus in aries descriptions very much i never knew why but what you said about the double negative and directing the typically outward tendencies onto oneself is interesting and got me thinking mine is 22 degrees so from what i understand if i were to pick up on the tendencies of another venus placement itd be taurus but i relate more to the venus in pisces descriptions,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey cool im a libra rising too i wish i could take credit for the chart analysis but it must have been someone with a similar user name im still kinda new to astrology but im glad another your friend or mary grace out there was helpful ha,YourFriendMaryGrace
my lilith is also in aries as is my mars both in the 7th house and conjunct my venus it occurred to me recently that in all my major relationships theres been an ongoing power struggle where my independence and need for autonomy is perceived as a threat to the relationship im also very choosy about who i have sex with to the point of long periods of celibacy even though i have a really high sex drive i dont even know why but i just cant do causal sex and im happy with how i look now but its been a loooong road to get here,YourFriendMaryGrace
how do you feel like it affects you im a retrograde venus in aries,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive forgotten several including the big one that seemed to cause some major glitches in the following days i take it as a sign that my jump was so successful ive just forgotten the previous timeline,YourFriendMaryGrace
you can find out right now using this free calculator once you know what nodes you have google north node in  and read a few different sites to get a good understanding,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you do locate your chart it should also tell you what houses your nodes are in which will give you even more insight into your souls journey,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love all of this shes very artistic but she has a short attention span so i think something that requires figuring it out as she goes would be perfect and hold her attention better thanks so much for the suggestions,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is so fascinating i absolutely give in to her wanting to quit things all the time and i would say ive been doing less discipline than id planned im a softie pisces sun lol but i can see how it is more helpful to her in the long run to teach her perseverance and responsibility now thanks for taking the time to respond its really useful stuff,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow its really good you brought this up because her dad and i are very recently divorced so theres lots of changes happening and my tendency is to keep her out of the loop unless its a big obvious thing that needs to be discussed but shes so observant that i find her asking questions that she wouldnt be asking if she hadnt already picked up on a lot of what is going unsaid thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
if youre open to astrology calculate your birth chart and see what your north node and south node is theyre commonly known as karmic parts of the chart with the north node being the traits you should develop and the south node being what you need to overcome for example my south node is in scorpio which indicates my past lives have been dramatic and probably full of controlabuse issues this is reflected in my past life memories and has been true for my current life as well and my north node is in taurus so im meant to learn how to be in control of myself alone and build a stable enjoyable life for myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
i suppose it comes down to a matter of belief but personally i believe that our loved ones animals included can use the dream world as a vehicle to come check in on us and let us know theyre still around i had some very memorable dream moments of conversing with my granddad after he died as did several other people in my family who were close to him,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry for your losses and hope it helped to be able to see them again,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is so helpful and encouraging thank you it definitely sounds like her she loves to paint and seems to have a knack for learning languages my challenge with her is that she is very interactive she doesnt like to entertain herself and wants me to be engaged in everything she does and she wants to do a lot so im always looking for ways to keep her busy so she doesnt feel ignored when mama needs a minute,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry to hear that,YourFriendMaryGrace
my 5 year old daughter is a gemini sun and moon pisces rising would you guys mind sharing your parenting tips what helped or would have helped little you thrive and feel supported growing up,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a pisces sun and a capricorn moon i consider it a blessing because the practical downtoearth cap qualities help me regulate my spaced out pisces tendencies,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre the best interpreter of your own dreams so the following is just my first impression take whats helpful and disregard the rest,YourFriendMaryGrace
seeing her in a gritty fast food restaurant  this was not a healthy or nurturing relationship,YourFriendMaryGrace
resembling someone you dislike  seeing with new clarity the aspects of her that didnt jive with you,YourFriendMaryGrace
all black clothing  endings closure,YourFriendMaryGrace
holding a baby  new beginnings,YourFriendMaryGrace
fwiw i find its pretty normal and common to dream of an ex once you find a better partner when youre still single and searching it can be harder to process the emotional impact of a past relationship and harder to see it clearly too youve found someone more compatible which makes it easier for your brain to sort out what was wrong before think of it like selftherapy its possible you woke up after did you ever love me because thats not something you can really be certain of either way,YourFriendMaryGrace
hope that helps and best of luck with your new relationship,YourFriendMaryGrace
the hot and cold thing,YourFriendMaryGrace
ok thank you for the straightforward feedback i definitely dont want to change him i guess i just wanted to understand if this is his true nature or if im just not someone he feels safe opening up to or what,YourFriendMaryGrace
hes a leo sun not positive but i think hes an aquarius rising no aries in his main planets but a neptune in scorpio venus in gemini yes to the temper tantrum letting it go quickly though the tantrums have so far been directed at people he feels are being tricky or unfair and not at me he does get jealouspissed at the thought of guys hitting on me though,YourFriendMaryGrace
i i am so glad you told me this thats the opposite of my natural reaction lol thank you but what if he never brings up anything thats bothering him like ever until eventually hes so fed up about something that he wants to end things and its something i could have made better if only id known,YourFriendMaryGrace
does anyone here have advice on getting a sag moon partner to open up about his feelings or at least admit to having them,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats amazing if you havent already looked at the research into past lives i think youll be surprised how much evidence there is to support it jim tucker is a great place to start,YourFriendMaryGrace
that being said i find its helpful to think about it from the perspective that regardless of whether or not the memories are real these images and storylines came from your own subconscious mind so theres something in olivers experiences that you can learn from or relate to in this life i did one of those regressions and had vivid recollections of being a really sad and sexually degraded woman named marnie who married for money and then spent the rest of her life depressed and bored out of her mind ive always had a strong desire to marry for love respectown my sexuality and make my own living and maybe those hard lessons marnie learned are part of the reason why or maybe its just a story my brain told me to illustrate how i feel either way it was helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for the update how would this affect someone with their venus in gemini,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know  but i do think it gets easier with practice for me the mental diet definitely seems to be helping that being said last night i found myself worrying again haha so im still learning,YourFriendMaryGrace
im reading this 44 minutes after you posted it,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for the things you never got to experience with him i bet hes so proud of you he cant stand it,YourFriendMaryGrace
first of all im really sorry youre feeling this way,YourFriendMaryGrace
id suggest you start by manifesting better selfesteem imagine that youre happier and more confident in yourself than youve ever been imagine that youre turning heads when you walk into the room or getting compliments that make your day  whatever feels like a wish fulfilled of being a confident person to you just leave sp out of it as much as possible for now and when you do think of him try to simply intend that hes happy and fulfilled too i know its not easy and definitely give yourself a grace period of processing that anger but it will help you in the long run to work towards genuinely wishing him well in life with or without you,YourFriendMaryGrace
once youve got that selfesteem up then work on the sp by then you may not even be interested in getting back together but if you are youll be all set to have a healthier happier relationship,YourFriendMaryGrace
sat  state akin to sleep but im not sure how it might be translated into the books youve read its the method of getting very relaxed but still awake and visualising the end result of what you intend to manifest,YourFriendMaryGrace
sp  specific or special person its not a neville term as far as i know its used by people who have a particular person usually someone they know like a friend or an ex they want to date,YourFriendMaryGrace
damn thats exciting youre a badass and you got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
there ya go perfect step one for your new formula i like being subscribed to  rhydrohomies because its like a wholesome drinking game for me lol if im scrolling reddit and i see one of their posts i stop and drink some water it also helps me to keep a reusable water bottle i can carry around with me its a little annoying to keep up with but thats part of what makes it an effective tool for remembering to hydrate once you get used to the wonderful feeling of being well hydrated for a few days in a row i bet itll become a habit the mental clarity alone makes it worthwhile not to mention youll start to look and feel more healthy,YourFriendMaryGrace
without any specifics its hard to offer advice but generally speaking i think starting with small changes in the way youre going about life can get the ball rolling go to bed thirty minutes earlier tonight drink a little more water than usual tomorrow say hi to that neighbor you usually dont speak to,YourFriendMaryGrace
kind of depends on the context of the dream but it often represents some new or underdeveloped part of yourself could be an aspect of your personality thats ready to grow or even an idea youd like to see brought to life feel free to message me if youd like some help with anything specific from the dreams,YourFriendMaryGrace
usually overwhelming emotions maybe youve been through or are in the midst of an emotional experience the good news is that you either made it through or youre well on your way to making it through,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh man thats a lot of stress to deal with and i think its understandable that youd feel totally overwhelmed by it but its also the kind of thing that a few years from now you could be telling a new partner or friend or colleague about and theyd say what you did that and laugh their ass off because it is so out of character for the person theyve come to know and love one of my favorite people in my life is a guy who got duis and stole shit in his younger days even spent some time in jail and now hes so damn accomplished and successful and happy that i a relatively successful woman with two kids look up to him a lot,YourFriendMaryGrace
point is as bad as this may seem it is really and truly okay and you can get through it and come out the other side with lessons learned and a hell of a story try and cut yourself some slack were lucky to have you here and i really hope you stick around,YourFriendMaryGrace
i often dream of my friends as a representation of some part of myself and sex dreams can often be symbolic of mergingintegratingaccepting two or more disconnected parts of yourself it might be helpful to think of the first thing that comes to mind when you think of each friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
for example lets say kevin is really comfortable in social situations a dream about having sex with him might be your subconscious minds way of illustrating that theres a part of you that can also be comfortable around new people and you can integrate it,YourFriendMaryGrace
you would probably find rastralprojection very useful youre already halfway there,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think first and foremost you should follow what brings you joy that being said real love in my opinion doesnt involve trickery and confusion and demands of loyalty its just freely given to you as you are im wary of anyone or anything that expects you to jump through hoops to meet their needsdesires it sounds like both these fellas have you in a rather vulnerable and confused place even as they may say its for your own good you are all you need to be empowered and vibe high,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know that theres anything we can be 100 certain about in this realm of existence thats part of the adventure but you might find it helpful or at least entertaining to do a past life regression meditation on youtube i saw myself in vivid detail as a humanoid cheetah looking being from another planet who decided to come here to spread love and light the revelations about that life and what i was like before continued to come to me through dreams and meditation for about a year afterwards regardless of whether or not its true it all came from my subconscious mind and really helped me know myself better as well as refocus my energy and refine my goals for this lifetime,YourFriendMaryGrace
i havent experienced flips with anything but fruit loops and it seems to flip every few months for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
this reads like a message from you to yourself that you can be more assertive its all started with you saying yes to a date not because youre dying to go but because you dont want to be rude and then you stay in a very uncomfortable situation because he told you to you only get freedom in the end by doing what you want and need to do in spite of the guys orders it seems like a horror story about being passive in other words,YourFriendMaryGrace
but thats just my interpretation and i might just be seeing it that way because i tend to be way too passive and im working on being more true to myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
gotcha thank you for clarifying were probably going to have to agree to disagree here but personally i believe holding fast to love and light is the only way to fight the dark responding with violence only begets more violence and round and round it goes nothing new about that i also believe that respecting the free will of others is essential to being truly loving and as such we cant really wake people up we find our own way when were ready,YourFriendMaryGrace
ok but what does fight mean to you as in physical violence,YourFriendMaryGrace
what do you mean by fight,YourFriendMaryGrace
is that across the street from the thinkery,YourFriendMaryGrace
four years ago at the time there were a lot of sightings reported around there and iirc there was a group of austin people who would meditate together at night in manor because it always seemed to summon ufo but i should have said it used to be a hot spot as i dont know how many have been spotted there as of the last couple years,YourFriendMaryGrace
manor seems to be a hot spot for ufo i saw one there on my 30th birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
keep googling them theres an article for just about every number you could possibly see but know this the idea of good and bad numbers is a human concept angels will only send you love and encouragement i get 43 pretty often and i like the last paragraph of this interpretation as it often crops up when im overwhelmed by the clutter in my home or workplace,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit oops just realized you said 42 not 43 but hopefully something i said was helpful anyway,YourFriendMaryGrace
can confirm am the wife,YourFriendMaryGrace
interesting that they chose to live as the person they dont remember being i would rather continue living the life i remembered and as a family member id rather be around the person who thoughtactedremembered as the person i knew than be with a virtual stranger who only looked like my loved one,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams of having a baby are often about birthing or in this case losing a part of yourself i think its interesting that the baby looked fake to you my guess is that the baby represents some aspect of yourself that you lost in the process of datingbreaking up with him the fact that youre not very sad about it and it didnt look real to you in the first place maybe suggests this part of yourself and wasnt a part of who you truly are,YourFriendMaryGrace
just something to consider if it doesnt resonate disregard,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is a synchronicity for me i had a strong urge yesterday and this morning to lie in the grass and get some sunshine i felt a little bad about it both times because my brain was so quick to remind me that theres chores to be done gotta get ready for work etc but yesterday my 2 year old seemed to read my mind and ran into the back yard and stretched out in the grass smiling i followed suit and then did it again this morning that little bit of spontaneous relaxation just for the pleasure of it seemed to set my whole body and soul on a better track,YourFriendMaryGrace
reading this at 1111,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my never knew about this before but its super intriguing thanks,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think so too and i wonder if the magnetic pole shift believed to have happened many thousands of years ago may have messed up earths frequencies or messed up our ability to receive them ive also wondered if this is where the tower of babel story comes from people working together to build something suddenly lose their ability to communicate and have to invent languages amongst themselves,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome so glad to hear it was helpful i relate to that very much especially the fear theres always a dozen whatifs that stop me from doing things that i know would serve me and others well we can unlock those chains i believe in us,YourFriendMaryGrace
mindless activities like riding the bus can put you in a hypnotic state much like meditation so it could have been some subconscious imagery coming through not unlike a dream it might help to think about it metaphorically bikes are used to move us forward is there a metaphorical bike youre leaving chained up when you could be well on your way to somethingsomewhere else could be a spiritual emotional or even literal journey youre ready to go on when i was ready to go back to work after having my baby but i was nervous and hesitating i started dreaming of cars stuck in a garage,YourFriendMaryGrace
feel free to send me a message,YourFriendMaryGrace
if youre open to the idea check out the subs for past lives and reincarnation,YourFriendMaryGrace

it might be helpful to do some imagination work with the end result in mind imagine your excitement in telling your mom how everything is going at work imagine how you feel a little nervous on your first day imagine a year from now when you are welcoming a new employee and remembering back to when you were the new guy,YourFriendMaryGrace
i had an interesting conversation with my husband the other day that prior to learning about the me would have turned into an argument lol we were discussing some decisions we made over the summer and the motivations behind them without going into boring detail basically the way i remember his motivations are completely different from the motivations he remembers not only having but discussing with me at length before this would have angered me and i would have thought he was delusional but seeing how me has effected us both differently some of the differences being cultural stuff that has happened since weve been married i feel like theres really no use trying to insist that im right about how i remember him feeling we might just be coming from slightly different timelines,YourFriendMaryGrace
ohhh i get it now that makes so much sense thank you for clarifying gonna try it tonight,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you set an alarm for every 90 minutes,YourFriendMaryGrace
if nikola tesla and johnny depp had a baby,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats really sweet  one of my coworkers was telling me recently that his wife watched the andy griffith show every night at the same time after she passed away he was watching a game with his friend neither of them touching the remote and the channel flipped over to the andy griffith show not once but twice they were really in love and when her cancer got really bad she told him before she died that she would do her best to let him know she was saying hi from the other side he had a lot of cool experiences like this,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps so sorry for your loss hope its a comfort to know hes never really gone,YourFriendMaryGrace
its usually a good thing a sign that youre discovering new or long forgotten parts of yourself the windows might represent that this part of yourself gives you a new outlook on life or the world around you,YourFriendMaryGrace
heres the original post for 2 cups usneakyrabbit,YourFriendMaryGrace
you look like little michael yagoobian before he turns evil which makes me want to take you home with me and love you if youre up for adoption please let me know before its too late,YourFriendMaryGrace
love your style,YourFriendMaryGrace
probably so the subconscious tends to tell stories to help us work through whatever were consciously thinking about you might really enjoy taking something like meyers briggs to help you get to know yourself better i was in the same boat trying to figure out who i was without the outward influences and it really helped me to take this and read about my type if the first result you get doesnt feel like it describes you very well try this one,YourFriendMaryGrace
hope that helps,YourFriendMaryGrace
re your post title you might find it interesting to check out the recent research coming out on the nature of our dreams it would seem that they are often meant to be helpful in processing our emotions and experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway i think the finale of the dream is quite interesting because bathrooms are where we tend to our most private business and in dreams they often represent the same thing but youre in a public bathroom which seems to be a hint that this is symbolizing a private element of your life that is difficult to keep under wraps the costume or rather pretending that you are wearing a costume makes me wonder if theres some part of yourself or your personal life that you try to disown in front of others,YourFriendMaryGrace
but you are the best interpreter of your dreams since you alone know whats on your mind and whats happening in your life if any of this was helpful awesome but if not please disregard,YourFriendMaryGrace
asking for help is an act of strength not weakness theres nothing pathetic about it and the sooner you can accept that the faster youll be able to make some strides this has been the biggest lesson ive had to learn this year and its tough its sad because we come into the world as little babies who are completely dependant on others for survival and we accept this about ourselves naturally but over time we internalize messages about being independent and forget that humanity wouldnt have survived nor would it continue to survive without relying on each other its natural and human to need help and by asking youre giving people like me a chance to experience the joy of lending a hand,YourFriendMaryGrace
another thing i see in your post is the negative spin youre putting on your life story i have failed at many things as well but thats just one way to look at my life i could just as easily frame my failures as many different things ive had the opportunity to learn the story we tell about ourselves is very very powerful and sets the stage for our future so look again at your life experiences and think about how much youve grown what youve learned what lessons and experiences youve had that you can utilize in your new chapter,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also recommend taking a personality test that can help you identify your strengths and weaknesses i really like meyers briggs  which of course is not perfect but has really helped me to understand myself and how i best fit into the world,YourFriendMaryGrace
okay i could go on and on but the most important thing i wanna say is that you are doing great housing debt wealth and all other forms of material success can never ever tell us about who you truly are you were worthy of love and acceptance the day you were born and you didnt bring a dime with you  the same is true for you now even if it doesnt feel like it i love you and im proud of you and  im here for you anytime,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams like this usually represent neglecting yourself in some way water often symbolizes emotions so perhaps you have some emotional cleaning out to do the big dangerous fish could represent anger sadness or some other feelings that are affecting your wellbeing,YourFriendMaryGrace
of course this is just one possible interpretation thoughts,YourFriendMaryGrace

i have similar dreams about trying to protect my daughter from critters and other dangers i think its just a symbol of the anxiety we feel knowing that we cant protect our children from everything dangerous in the world,YourFriendMaryGrace
i just want to say how terribly sorry i am for your loss  i know that pain my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage and its a heartbreak i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy please give yourself time to grieve and reach out to me and anyone else who is willing to listen you are not alone and you never have to be im here for you anytime,YourFriendMaryGrace
the grungy mirror likely represents not being able to see yourself clearly floods almost always symbolize an overwhelming level of emotion this could be a current situation or something from the past but typically if its set in the past there would be some indication of that in the dream which there doesnt seem to be the person trying to stop you from mopping up the water could be a lot of things think about who or what in your life is an obstacle to sorting out your feelings it could be a representation of some part of yourself that avoids working through difficult times,YourFriendMaryGrace
the finale is a bit difficult to guess could indicate that the overwhelming emotions are workrelated but honestly im not sure,YourFriendMaryGrace
does any of that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
the nasa solar page is down as are a bunch of other observatories,YourFriendMaryGrace

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace
see  for more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive been following this as well and one of the main reasons people have been skeptical about it being related to the sun is that other solar observatories around the world are still up and running interestingly that no longer appears to be the case list of solar observatories going offline,YourFriendMaryGrace
very curious,YourFriendMaryGrace
i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy cake day friend thanks for sharing this great picture of your handsome pops and uncle,YourFriendMaryGrace
you are an amazing artist this is beautiful,YourFriendMaryGrace
the most effective tip ive found is setting the intention as youve already done by jumping and carrying on as if its already done think about it like placing an online order you trust that it will come to you but you dont expect it to show up instantly or order it again and again you just place the order and know it will be delivered,YourFriendMaryGrace
it also greatly helps to put it out of your mind as much as possible and when you do think of it practice feeling grateful for the thing youve asked for in other words think im so thankful that i get to have  rather than why havent i gotten my  yet,YourFriendMaryGrace
ahh fair enough well i wish you the best of luck and if i can help you with your experimentation lemme know,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think your belief in it working is pretty helpful so going into it expecting it wont work may manifest exactly that  not working i wouldnt advise you plan on trying again for the same thing rather do your best to expect the jump you already did will work that being said i typically wait at least a week between jumps,YourFriendMaryGrace
more gradual methods can be found at rlawofattraction or rnevillegoddard ive had success with both but mostly prefer these over the jumping methods,YourFriendMaryGrace
loving and forgiving people brings you much greater joy and peace of mind than holding onto your frustrations and pain easier said than done i know but worth the effort every time,YourFriendMaryGrace
narwals are not a fictional creature,YourFriendMaryGrace
i used to coordinate weddings brides and grooms were 10x easier to deal with than the parents of the couple tended to be moms of the bride and groom ime are very nervous about everything going well and end up being a huge nuisance trying to control everything and worrying about stuff for no reason,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats cool who knows you may find that you have more in common with your sister than you thought and you could encourage each othermanifest together,YourFriendMaryGrace
my most successful two cups jump ever was for more creative ideas maybe try jumping for business ideas,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was in high school learning about the french and indian war little did i know my future husband was in college also learning about the french and indian war pretty weird but we have a lot of these synchronicities from before we even met and many more since then,YourFriendMaryGrace
i just remember feeling really sad and wondering if it would have a bigger impact on american history than the french and indian war,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was walking through my apartment complex on a rainy night there were lots of snails on the sidewalks and i stepped on one this caused me to scream and become frozen in fear of crunching another one it took my husband a while to convince me to start walking again and almost as soon as i did i stepped on another snail rather than get stuck again or ya know watch where i was walking i decided to make a run for it crunching snails and screaming all the way home,YourFriendMaryGrace
st johns wort its otc and remarkably effective also just taking good care of myself even or especially when i dont feel like it specifically i try to have at least one green smoothie every day so im sure i get at least 45 daily fruits and vegetables getting out in the sunshine exercising several days a week limiting my internetscreen time and making time to do creative stuff this is not medical advice by any means but personally i took antidepressants for years and they werent nearly as helpful as all of the above also finding friends who arent judgmental and will listen to my problems and empathize ive been fortunate to find a few online and irl friends like this and its lifechanging,YourFriendMaryGrace
the smell of chlorine and sunscreen public libraries american girl stuff i often feel nostalgic around 4pm because it was my favorite time of day as a child i would get to eat snacks and watch pbs,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so damn cool my spiritual journey was kickstarted in a single evening early 2013 and its hard to explain just how radically lifechanging a moment like that can be when talking to someone who hasnt experienced it how awesome that yours was during an ellipse and yes please do pm me i love to chat about this stuff,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like to meditate and beforehand i set the intention of receiving any kind of help that comes from a source of love and light however i dont think theres anything you have to do other than be willing if youve ever woken up in the morning with a new insight or just been walking along and suddenly had a revelation or clarity about a problem thats what i would consider a download,YourFriendMaryGrace
for me days with big energy shifts or upgrades often make me feel super restless like i need to run sprints or something and in the days following i often find myself having enormously helpful dreams about my emotional life sometimes i make unplanned changes for example on 8818 which is sometimes called lions gate i suddenly lost all interest in eating meat others found that their habits and addictions were suddenly much easier to kick,YourFriendMaryGrace
now that youre aware that these things often come in waves youll be able to make note of your own personal symptoms its different for everyone yet theres a lot of common experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
id love to hear about your achievements if youre comfortable sharing  i think its really cool you live in ireland i spent the summer in dublin one year and loved it my kids are only 4 and 2yo but i hope they grow up to travel and have different experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
as for always being the one to reach out first i feel ya try not to take it too personally people are busy and caught up in the day to day world and just dont take the time to reach out sometimes it doesnt make you any less valuable or important in this world,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you and im proud of you please feel free to pm me anytime you want to chat,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah the subconscious mind is pretty cool were all different yet we dream in a lot of the same or very similar metaphors and symbols when im feeling vulnerable or exposed in some way i usually dream that im in the shower and people are just walking right in the bathroom to talk to me,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is so awesome what program do you use,YourFriendMaryGrace
the best way to make them stop is to figure out what theyre trying to tell you even stressful dreams nightmares etc are your brains way of sorting through the emotions and situations youre faced with starting school back can definitely be stressful but it could be something from your past or even worries about the future that are surfacing,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you feel like sharing your dreams or even just some of the recurring themes id be happy to help out,YourFriendMaryGrace
front yards usually represent the way you present yourself to others or how you feel like youre perceived toilets are typically used in private so having to use one on the lawn would seem to be a metaphor for you feeling like your privacy and personal business are exposed think about what in your life has madeis making you feel vulnerable and it might help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to help you with,YourFriendMaryGrace
we really are my friend i love how the internet enables us to find our kinds of people,YourFriendMaryGrace
i couldnt agree more about the monetary system i really believe well evolve out of it or it will simply collapse at some point in our lifetimes in the meantime im sending you abundance vibes with all my heart were gonna make so many people happy with our random tips gifts and donations,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit another thought i had that seemed to come from somewhere greater than me if i really want to peacefully disrupt the system and i do what better way to do so than to open myself up to greater abundance and redistribute it myself it seems obvious now but it was a revelation when it came to mind yesterday,YourFriendMaryGrace
you got me thinking with your post so thank you as well its funny you mention the financial stability  ive been having this realization over the past 24 hours that i dont need to be broke to be a good person not that theres anything wrong with being poor in fact i think guys like jesus and ghandi are in part why i have been afraid to accumulate money but for now i see that getting to the point where im not worried about the bills and actually have enough to take care of myself and others would better enable me to give freely and use my gifts of service its a wildly different perspective but it seems like im getting the message that being financially strapped is actually keeping me in a place where i have to think about my needs more than i would without financial stress i think too that i need to learn to trust myself im terrified to turn into a selfinterested rich person who is negligent in the needs of those less fortunate so i keep myself in a situation where im always busy trying to make ends meet which isnt really helping the less fortunate either,YourFriendMaryGrace
the silver triangle,YourFriendMaryGrace
i havent had the chance to watch your video yet but your title is a little synchronicity for me as ive had the phrase you cant pour from an empty cup running through my mind lately i have two children 4 and 2yo a husband a dog a cat two parttime jobs friends and family who have their own emotional and practical needs i try to fill the list goes on and i can do a lot but i tend to be selfsacrificing to the point where i simply dont take the time to nourish myself or get enough sleep,YourFriendMaryGrace
i used to consider taking care of myself as service to self but i no longer see it that way i see that getting adequate nourishment and rest putting on clothes that make me feel confident instead of schlepping around in whatever i pull from the drawer first exercising getting out in the sunshine and putting on makeup or earrings or whatever else feels fun that day these things allow me to open my arms wider and work harder for others,YourFriendMaryGrace
to me the only real difference is intention im refilling my cup so i have more to pour out not so i can keep it full and set it aside just for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
as for the darkworkers thing i actually never heard that term until this week but it perfectly describes my pastlife memories on a spaceship and essentially what i do best in this life i seem to have a knack for walking right up to the bad guys and diffusing situations breaking up fights etc which is kind of funny because im tiny but when i first ground myself in love and light i am somehow able to gently talk down angry men who could chuck me across the street if they wanted to lol but it is essential to do so as though they are my beloved brothers  because they are,YourFriendMaryGrace
so i consider myself a lightworker i just thrive in the presence of darkness and transmute it the best i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
this sounds like a game i would have played all day you should try rtipofmytongue,YourFriendMaryGrace
i am so very sorry this happened i have been the first person to drive up on the scene of a fatal accident and it was horrible i was so upset i couldnt sleep all night  im glad youre reaching out to us and i hope that you can make peace with this as for what the universe is telling you dont stress about it if theres a lesson in this im sure it will be clear to you in good time,YourFriendMaryGrace
please know that theres no shame in your feeling that you wanted no part of it its a horrendously traumatic thing to witness and our brains are wired to avoid trauma you managed to override that fight or flight reaction in order to call 911 on her behalf and thats all anyone could ask of you,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you and im sending you all the good vibes i can please feel free to pm me if youd like to talk about it youre not alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
when this happens to me i like to stare at the palms of my hands sometimes i pretend im a character that just morphed into the body im in and im seeing my own hands for the first time come to think of it this is a much weirder thing that i do than the other thing i posted in this thread,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway it zaps me back to the present moment and its almost surreal sometimes like i suddenly feel more alive,YourFriendMaryGrace
i take it as a sign im on the right track i think we live in the midst of infinite timelines and repeating signs that feel positive are basically a function of the more optimal timelines,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry im always here for you if you wanna pm,YourFriendMaryGrace
i work with moderately famous people but the nature of my job means never talking or posting any details about it lest i lose my job,YourFriendMaryGrace
the sheer number of great ideas for art products and businesses that come to my mind every day and i almost never do anything with them,YourFriendMaryGrace
when you said it generated energy something clicked in my mind because when i saw the shape turn into a structure being built i felt it had tremendous importance and ive read theories that structures like the pyramids were made to generate energy and maybe even create portals or open dimensions,YourFriendMaryGrace
tell me what you think about this image its a recreation of what the great zimbabwe ruins looked like and how they were being used in the 1500s and the people who lived in them at the time said they didnt build the walls they were built in ancient times using unknown technology heres an aerial view,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit another potential clue looks an awful lot like a cell its got the nucleus and everything diagram,YourFriendMaryGrace
really i was hoping someone would recognize it truly mindblowing how we share these things it makes me feel so thankful for the internet and the opportunity to compare notes,YourFriendMaryGrace
tell me about the waves does it feel like the shape is creating the energy somehow,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont feel bizarre but i did have an awful lot of energy both physical and mental all night long couldnt sleep a wink i wrote this to a friend at like 3am because i couldnt stop thinking about it,YourFriendMaryGrace
theres this little mystery shape ive had in my minds eye since i was a tiny child maybe 3 or so i knew this shape so well that id constantly see it in clouds patterns textiles everywhere pareidolia but instead of a face i see a 2d twotone shape that looks something like this,YourFriendMaryGrace
the feelings i have at the sight of it even today are like a deep recognition and a sense of nostalgia which has always mystified me because what even is this how can i recognize something i dont remember,YourFriendMaryGrace
and then one day whilst meditating about two months ago i saw it appear in my minds eye and then transform juuuust a little bit into a birds eye view of an ancient building being constructed with ancient people working together just a super quick 8 bit quality glimpse with the implicit knowing that it was ancient,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know what any of it means but its jolting to have a sudden development after 30 years of having no idea what i was looking at,YourFriendMaryGrace
in addition to the meditation and suggestions already offered it might be helpful to look up some common dream interpretations of the basic elements of these images or even just contemplate and do word association with yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
knights make me think of armor and therefore protection but being in a coffin makes me think of the death of some form of protectionarmor many different cups makes me think of hosting or communing with many people or having an abundance of domestic resources but having them on a shelf behind a knights coffin makes those things feel less than accessible thats just my brain though needless to say it may not be remotely close to what your own self is telling you,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww i think its sweet if she was an awful person in life id totally find it sinister but it sounds like she was lovely and just wants to be in the familiar for a while longer,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for your loss op i hope you find it comforting to know her essence is still with you,YourFriendMaryGrace
is it okay if i post something i more or less agree with because i think paul sabotaged jesus message on purpose,YourFriendMaryGrace

ive happily eaten way too many burgers and chicken wings to claim that the actual eating part makes me feel sad but thinking about them being killed does,YourFriendMaryGrace
i know and far be it from me to begrudge anyone a good meal i just wasnt expecting the adorable rabbitfeelingsafeinacuddlyblanket imagery to take a turn for the slaughterhouse lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
that lpt has a surprisingly sad ending,YourFriendMaryGrace
this post is turning into a karma goldmine  thanks little bots maybe the last few days of downvotes were just their dark night of the code,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like to imagine them having little bot protocol meetings,YourFriendMaryGrace
dammit qp295 you gave uqueenameliafox 18 upvotes were downvote bots dude downvote bots now get back out there and fix this mess,YourFriendMaryGrace
woah 18 upvotes in 2 minutes did the downvote bots have a sudden change of heart this is hilarious and awesome,YourFriendMaryGrace

i used to live in that neighborhood that blue eiffel tower looking thing is adjacent to sea world and everything else is just a large grassy area,YourFriendMaryGrace

im sorry i bothered you just sharing my thoughts love you bro,YourFriendMaryGrace
what did you guys do with them,YourFriendMaryGrace
also this is excellent rwritingprompts material,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont claim to know how it works but i can elaborate in case its helpful i was telling myself that everything would be okay no matter what and trying not to focus on the money so much as the goal of having our needs met in fact my husband got the email  about the money almost immediately after getting off the phone with a family member we were considering moving in with so in a sense it came through the minute we gave up weird,YourFriendMaryGrace
manifested 3300 that we were previously told wouldnt be available for many years it came when we really needed it without us even trying it was crazy like some law changed and the funds had to be released to us immediately,YourFriendMaryGrace
my body has changed quite a bit too though tthats more of a lesson in be careful what you wish for lol i used to be athletic and pretty thicc but i desperately wanted to be skinny and petite like a ballerina through a years long process of getting sick depressed anemic etc im now so small and skinny that i often hear you should eat more i used to daydream about being told that and now it really bums me out im at the gym trying to put on muscle and eating as much as i can trying to get my booty back haha so yeah i think its all attainable just make sure you have goals youll be happy with longterm,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sure hes a great guy and thats probably why hell still be your friend after this personally im much happier now that ive grown into friendships where we dont poke at each others insecurities for fun life has a way of making us feel like crap about ourselves all on its own at best friendships are a welcome break from that not an additional source of it just my personal perspective friend to friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
whoever you are the fact that your friend would post something like this tells me that you are someone who is so awesome that people will go out of their way to try and put you down,YourFriendMaryGrace
dont let em you keep being awesome and dont let goofballs like op get you down,YourFriendMaryGrace
you look like kristin cavallari,YourFriendMaryGrace
no problem i used to live in socal and took about a million visitors from back home to see the walk of fame lol theyve always looked this way in my timeline but im curious what others remember,YourFriendMaryGrace
grey slab pink star gold letters and an icon for the type of media the celeb was best known for ex a camera for film stars,YourFriendMaryGrace
i i thought it was just me,YourFriendMaryGrace
nothing wrong with feeling compassion imo there are no bad guys just lost wounded and confused souls who dont realize theyre just pawns it is sad,YourFriendMaryGrace
im really sorry about your dad i hope youre hanging in there,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry you went through that i cant imagine  sending you hugs and lots of love,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is so intriguing and weird its rglitchinthematrix material for sure,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for your loss  i hope youre doing okay,YourFriendMaryGrace
im interested in the story if you feel like sharing also do you remember what the individuals looked like,YourFriendMaryGrace
heart stopped beating,YourFriendMaryGrace
were you aware that you were dead did you have thoughts or feelings,YourFriendMaryGrace
have you guys ever listened to these songs remixed to sound like theyre playing in an empty mall they fill me with a strange mix of nostalgia and existential dread,YourFriendMaryGrace
im gonna copy and paste the thing i wrote in an ask reddit thread about alien abduction,YourFriendMaryGrace
not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago  he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared,YourFriendMaryGrace
it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day,YourFriendMaryGrace
i had a series of past life dreams after this that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button,YourFriendMaryGrace
the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate,YourFriendMaryGrace
eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all,YourFriendMaryGrace
the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing,YourFriendMaryGrace
long answer pregnant women dont lactate unless theyre already nursing another baby milk doesnt come in until a few days after the baby is born before that what comes out is a sticky clearish substance called colostrum which is easier for the newborn to digest and contains the nutrients it needs most,YourFriendMaryGrace
short answer shes most likely got a breastfed baby at home,YourFriendMaryGrace
under the umbrella tree,YourFriendMaryGrace
my four year old and i were painting a picture together and i had to briefly stop when her baby brother woke up from his nap i told her id be back in a few minutes and that she could play on the ipad in my absence she typically jumps at the chance to play on the ipad so i thought nothing of leaving the paint out as i hurried off to the kids room big mistake,YourFriendMaryGrace
angered by the sudden motherdaughterpaintytime interruption she proceeded to paint all over herself the floor two cabinets and my grandparents antique pie safe,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah great minds think alike,YourFriendMaryGrace
i cant speak for your mom but i really just want my kids to be happy if getting marriedbeing in a relationship wouldnt make them happy i sure wouldnt want them to fake it on my account she might just be talking about it under the assumption thats what you want you know,YourFriendMaryGrace
at any rate youre perfect just as you are,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry  i hope things get better for the both of you soon,YourFriendMaryGrace
thinking about it metaphorically do you feel like youre unable to get control over some kind of situation in your life maybe you cant say what youre really thinking to a boss or family member food often represents nurture maybe you lack nurturing environment in your life and have to take what you can get in terms of feeling loved and cared for im not sure to be honest but thats what comes to mind at first glance,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry  and im glad youre here,YourFriendMaryGrace
i am so very sorry for what youre going through  it may encourage you to know that theres thousands and thousands of accounts of loved ones reaching out in this way letting their families know theyre okay i experienced it myself after my grandfather died science tells us that our brains operate in 11 dimensions only 4 of which are we currently able to observe and measure so theres an awful lot to our consciousness that we dont yet understand but that doesnt mean its not happening once upon a time there was no credible evidence for radio waves or electromagnetic fields  i think our consciousness is eternal and just like the internet doesnt cease to exist because your laptop dies we go on long after this particular body were inhabiting here is done,YourFriendMaryGrace
im always here for you anytime please feel free to pm me sending lots of love to you and your family,YourFriendMaryGrace
that was a dick move on their parts for sure but fwiw the way you turned him down so politely tells me youre a really good person i hope you findfound someone who deserves you,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey there lots to unpack here but ill do my best to help the first thing that jumps out at me is a recurring theme of overindulgence too many chocolate covered strawberries public masturbation taking things too far with the girl you werent engaged too etc the subconscious tends to use metaphors to illustrate things so it helps to think about what reallife situations and feelings might be symbolized here,YourFriendMaryGrace
obviously theres a lot more going on in these dreams but that seems like a good place to start does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
i actually laughed out loud thanks for this one,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like to google angel number x with x being the number i saw and see what if anything resonates but off the top of my head 4545 is interesting from a numerology perspective because in numerology you add single digits together and then if you end up with a double digit number you reduce it to a single digit number by adding the individual digits together,YourFriendMaryGrace
so 45 9 and 4545 18 and 189  basically any way you slice it youve got a pretty potent 9 there in numerology 9 is associated with the end of a cycle and old things falling away to make room for the new given all youve been through this year that seems pretty apt,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know if thats helpful but if nothing else maybe itll give you a fun rabbit hole to fall down,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps im so sorry for all your troubles hang in there theres brighter days ahead,YourFriendMaryGrace
you dont pee on the whole stick lol just the cottony part that sticks out of the very end which is then covered by a plastic cap,YourFriendMaryGrace
you can request that some of your birthday or christmas presents be donations to a cause you care about especially if you tend to get gifts you dont particularly enjoy,YourFriendMaryGrace
but you shouldnt feel guilty be thankful you were born into abundance and thankful that you have opportunities to pay it forward i think its lovely that you recognize your good fortune and want to help others,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is really lovely thanks 1889 man for inspiring me to be a better friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
i can understand you being disappointed but i can also understand wanting my kids to have as normal of a childhood as possible and be able to just focus on family time when taking them places it would suck as the kid to feel like your parents career is always going to be a priority,YourFriendMaryGrace
this makes me happy i love kith and especially scott,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes waited on them in this context means they served them a meal or drinks at a restaurant i can see how it would be confusing since waited on them could also mean it took time for them to arrive,YourFriendMaryGrace
sometimes i listen to binaural beats or a meditation track on youtube but most of the time i just lie still and focus on relaxing my body from the feet up then i mentally repeat  loving phrases starting with i love myself this is a tricky one for me because i tend to dwell on my mistakes and i dont usually feel like i actually love myself at first but i keep repeating it until it feels good then i focus on my love for my family and friends much easier and finally everyone in the world and the universe after that i try to let my thoughts drift off unless some other affirmations come to mind by then im usually sinking into the deep waves and thats when the tingling and vibrating begins sometimes it causes me to come back up to a fully conscious state because i get kind of excited lol and i have to remind myself that its normal and i can let go,YourFriendMaryGrace
i often experience this in meditation and light sleep cycles to me its like im subconsciously conversing with my angels and its a normal occurrence in that state but of course once i wake up im often left wondering what we were even talking about and the vibration thing often accompanies the chats i especially feel it in my neck and face,YourFriendMaryGrace
sometimes ill remember key points or suggestions that are really helpful and encouraging other times ill only remember something random and seemingly nonsensical but it will make sense later this morning i could only remember them telling me something about tiny bears lol so im excited to discover whatever the heck that was about,YourFriendMaryGrace
all of the above being said its a good idea to meditate on love and light a bit before going to sleep or meditating as i have also had the strange experience of some less benevolentfeeling interactions as well,YourFriendMaryGrace
tldr i have no definitive answers but i know what you mean,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww your mama sounds like my kind of person my best friends mom always said were making a memory in the same contexts i think its a nice way to look at things,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so happy youre okay i was quite sad to see you not yourself you get infinite love and forgiveness from me always everyone here does please take good care of yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
i had sleep paralysis once and it was a demonic cat trying to suffocate me it sucked i felt that it had this intense hatred for me i really dont know if these sleep creatures are actual demonic entities or what but its certainly not fun to experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
the dream itself feels more metaphorical to me as dreams often are can you think of any reallife parallels the coworker may represent an aspect of yourself maybe something you do as way to escape something you cant otherwise avoid for example if you dont like your job but you cant quit the job itself could be represented by the person chasing you the fainting coworker could represent calling in sick does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think god is everything and nothing can exist outside of it because it is existence itself to be anything is to be god the source of everything i think the idea of god having personality and individuality is a manmade concept devised for various reasons heres a post i wrote here quite a few months ago which is about an experience i had which blasted my last remaining christian ideals about god out of the water well except for the god is love part that part absolutely still rings true but thats just me ultimately you have to find the truth for yourself and you may discover something different,YourFriendMaryGrace
think about it symbolically and what barbie might represent to you subconsciously if you liked playing with them as a kid maybe its a symbol of carefree childhood joy thats just out of reach or maybe its about trying to live up to a certain image or standard of beautylifestyle and feeling like other people do it better does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams are most often symbolic and the subconscious attaches or in this case doesnt attach emotion accordingly so in this dream id guess that its really about killing some part of yourself associated with that person as a way to grow,YourFriendMaryGrace
for example maybe your mom has been a little too pushy about your career choices a dream about killing her wouldnt need to feel sad because letting go of her input and listening to your own life goals would be a helpful thing for you hope that helps but if not let me know,YourFriendMaryGrace
true spirituality and drugs are polar opposites,YourFriendMaryGrace
im one of many people who was using a psychadelic when my life changed forever i was going through a really hard time and one night i smoked some weed and was crying out asking the universe god something to give me a reason to live then it hit me like a ton of bricks that love is the answer to life the universe and everything i knew it was true to the core of my being and it set me on a path of awakening that has continued sans drugs for five years now ive had equally profound experiences in sober meditation so i dont mean to imply that drugs are necessary at all just that some of them can and do provide a little window or cheat code into 5d that can spark enormous spiritual growth,YourFriendMaryGrace
i sure try to be that kind of person everyone needs help and support sometimes ive been lucky to have people on reddit cheer me up when i needed it and im always glad to pay it forward,YourFriendMaryGrace
check out rprecognition  this is a very cool and surprisingly common thing,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh that must have been traumatizing im so sorry,YourFriendMaryGrace
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace
see  for more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
im really sorry youre dealing with physical disabilities and some bad luck but youre right youre a survivor and you can and will cross the ocean  i hope you have a good day too and please feel free to reach out any time,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know you but i have a feeling youre being way too hard on yourself wanna pm me and we can chat i dont have all the answers but ive hit rock bottom and bounced back to a better place more than once and id be honored to be a listening ear,YourFriendMaryGrace
this sounds like a disagreement or misalignment between your conscious and unconscious mind youre consciously creating positive thoughts and so the icky stuff comes out of hiding to be dealt with it sucks but ultimately its a good thing because dealing with the icky stuff will allow you to feel consciously and unconsciously better about yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
try to identify the thoughts and feelings youre having just before the selfhating thoughts pop up chances are youre experiencing shame guilt or some other difficult emotion and thinking i hate myself is a sort of mental escape hatch to avoid processing those feelings once youve identified the trigger face the source of those feelings headtohead and work through them forgive yourself forgive the situations that have hurt you or caused you to hurt others and keep up the positive affirmations,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you,YourFriendMaryGrace
hold up what happened with the dead body did you call the police,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive had some glitchy stuff happen after doing the two cup method but it was harmless stuff i wouldnt fault yourself for that persons death or your fils job loss unless those occurrences could somehow move you closer to your goals i really doubt theyre related i second ucoolchic101 suggestion though neville was awesome and his method is much more gentle,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think our brains subconsciously store just about everything sometimes ill have a random flashback to eating at a certain restaurant or hanging out with an old friend and then when i look back at my journal or a photo i took ill discover that it was exactly a year or many years ago its pretty cool were all a lot smarter than we consciously realize,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps happy cake day,YourFriendMaryGrace
im far from family too and ime ditching social media has actually made me feel more connected to them i actually have to call or text them which enables us to really talk about our struggles and hopes and stuff rather than the superficial level of interaction via social media,YourFriendMaryGrace
i wonder if it would help to have a rprecognition link somewhere visible im fascinated by prophetic dreams and ive had one myself but since theres a whole sub dedicated to them and a lot of the dream posts here are precognitive it might cut down on the quantity if there were a link,YourFriendMaryGrace
that being said i do enjoy the dream posts here,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry friend  theyre very lucky to have you around hang in there,YourFriendMaryGrace
when my mom wants to listen to a song she just turns on the radio and says lets find it and most of the time she does its like she just knows itll be playing even if its an old song,YourFriendMaryGrace
weird i definitely feel like theres an energy shifting tonight but for whatever reason im feeling pretty great everything feels more real somehow like im immersed in the present moment more than usual its interesting how these things hit us differently,YourFriendMaryGrace
some of my favorite movies are the ones where the character has a lot of sadness and difficulty to overcome it would be a pretty boring movie if everything was just sunshine and rainbows from start to finish think about harry potter his parents are dead he lives with his emotionally abusive aunt and uncle and his bullying cousin then he gets into a magical school only to find out that teachers apparently hate him and some really powerful guy wants to kill him but thats why we keep watching because we know these challenges are what make it an epic story and its not the end yet its not the end of your story either and i for one would like to keep watching,YourFriendMaryGrace
sense of adventure gentle gets excited about stuff willing to consider other peoples perspectives and either change his mind or respectfully disagree ive been married to a man like that for 11 years and hes awesome,YourFriendMaryGrace
oops thanks,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit your bio made me laugh keep up the okay work,YourFriendMaryGrace
please listen to me i know it probably just seems like fun and spooky entertainment to interact with these different energies but it isnt a good idea at all until our technology advances enough to detect other dimensions its almost impossible to know for certain what exactly youre inviting in but regardless its almost certainly bad juju,YourFriendMaryGrace
i might get roasted for taking you seriously because a lot of people havent had the experiences weve had but look  theres far more power and beauty in the love and light kind of energy and it offers real love and protection far better than whatever bullshit a is peddling you need to get rid of the tools youve been using and issue some firm but loving commands to them go away and repeat as needed and if youre still spiritually curious and i hope you are check out subs like rsoulnexus or rastralprojection or rluciddreaming and seek out some positive metaphysical experiences  theyre much more fun i promise,YourFriendMaryGrace
what can you remember about them are there any recurring themes the subconscious mind tends to create nightmares in effort to help you consciously process emotions that you may be suppressing i had nightmares nearly every night for years until i learned how to understand what they were telling me im happy to help you with this if you feel like sharing youre welcome to pm me as well,YourFriendMaryGrace
the first lecture is just a long rambling monologue and its impossible to tell whether or not what theyre saying should go in your notes,YourFriendMaryGrace
think about what the old man might represent within yourself for example a dream about killing a greedy person might mean youre trying to be more generous does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
theres nothing wrong with wanting to be around people im not an extrovert by any means but too much alone time makes me feel crazy and kinda sad after a while i think its good and even important to get out of the house and talk to people we have a light to shine after all,YourFriendMaryGrace
and dont do what i did and carry on for ages assuming that youre alone im amazed at how many people i meet that are every bit as awake as i am uber drivers homeless people baristas theres a lot of people waking up and have been for a while just gotta give them the space to feel like they can open up,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the meantime im always here if you want to chat,YourFriendMaryGrace
just to clarify i didnt mean to imply that 1010 bullies were bullied as well though i did say most ime kids and grownups who truly feel good about themselves and their place in the world tend to want others to feel good too and sadly the reverse tends to be true also,YourFriendMaryGrace
at any rate you sound like a wonderful teacher and im very glad that lil guy found his way to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
sure seems likely to me im so sorry about your pup i hope youre able to take the time you need to grieve sometimes i find that just listening to a sad song really leaning into the feelings id typically try to avoid like sadness and letting myself have a good hard cry makes a big difference,YourFriendMaryGrace
this typically represents a situation where youve felt you had to kill some aspect of yourself for example maybe the loved one you strangled is a very funny person irl that would mean youve had to stifle your sense of humor lately does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you with all of the hearts,YourFriendMaryGrace
i bought a day pass to the swimming pool for myself and my kids so my life will have a lot more chlorine and floaties,YourFriendMaryGrace
im in,YourFriendMaryGrace
consider how you should act with young children saying i love you every time they misbehave would be a terrible thing to do to them and it would be deeply and genuinely unfair to the other kids who may be suffering at the hands of unchecked bullying,YourFriendMaryGrace
far be it from me to tell you how to parent but in my personal experience as a parent and teacher i have found the opposite to be true when my 4 year old yells at me responding to her with love and compassion is absolutely the most effective way to help her see that shes wrong i used to try and oneup her by being very stern tough love and all that but it only served to create more anger and frustration ive learned that by responding with love and compassion shes infinitely more willing to listen to what i have to say apologize and do better,YourFriendMaryGrace
as far as bullies go 1010 times they are acting out of insecurity and most of the time they are being bullied themselves often at home its not a disservice to the children who are being bullied for a grownup to let the bully know he or she is loved its the surest way to help them see that they dont need to hurt others to feel good about themselves,YourFriendMaryGrace
none of the above has be in place of consequences or in place of explaining to them what they did wrong its just a whole lot more likely that theyll actually listen and want to change if they first feel that they are worthy of love,YourFriendMaryGrace
101 dalmatians  the animated one,YourFriendMaryGrace
hmm if your so is willing it might help to join forces on this and speak your instruction out loud remember to instruct not request some people recommend burning white sage around the house as well also check out the spiritual lessons in the sidebarcommunity info as theres some specifically for protection if it persists let us know sending you all the good vibes,YourFriendMaryGrace
the sense im getting is that the energy is less than positive dont be afraid of it or angry towards it just ground yourself in love and light and issue a firm instruction to leave your presence think of it like a neighborhood kid whos out late and needs to go home youre the adult here and you have the power to send it away,YourFriendMaryGrace
beautiful eyes,YourFriendMaryGrace
whats the thought process behind that myth its very confusing,YourFriendMaryGrace
typically yeah but some womens bodies are just like lets do this and labors can escalate very quickly with my first baby i was just chilling breathing through spacious contractions like a champ got in the tub to clean up before heading to the hospital and suddenly my contractions were less than two minutes apart my second baby came so fast that i was still gathering up my phone charger and toiletries when i felt him move down and the urge to push was so strong i couldnt walk to the car we had to call for an ambulance and within minutes there were five firefighters surrounding my bed strategizing how to get a stretcher down our narrow hallway lol if we have a third i might have to either camp out at the hospital for the last couple months or deliver it myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
please tell your grandmother i said thank you for sharing this lovely little glimpse of her life with us,YourFriendMaryGrace
im gonna have to take a pass on the fusion but thanks just the same and ill keep a steady stream of love and light headed your way  and im glad it was helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
is there anyone irl you could reach out to maybe go for a coffee or something i dont know what your social life is like but for me staying inside with my own thoughts and energy can get overwhelming and confusing its important to keep a steady footing in the human world and it might help to get out of the house and do some normal stuff every day just a humble suggestion,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey buddy things seem to be a bit muddled and confusing in your communication lately are you okay i know youve been struggling with the job search and as someone in the same boat i just wanna say that youre not alone and youre worth so much more than a job could ever encompass im sending you lots of love and light and i want you to know that im thankful for the encouragement youve given me here so many times please dont forget who you truly are you have a gift for offering clarity and support to those who feel lost just remember to reach out when you are in need of the same you dont have to have all the answers none of us do and thats why were here im always here for you k  love you brother,YourFriendMaryGrace
i care about you,YourFriendMaryGrace
awesome please do report back i wrote creatively unfulfilled on one and creatively fulfilled on the other i recommend doing it at night i think it helps to go to sleep with the expectation so your subconscious can adjust without the distractions of daily life have fun,YourFriendMaryGrace
doughnut shaped,YourFriendMaryGrace
out of the thousands and thousands of people ive interacted with online ive become close friends with three of them two of the three turned out to be infjs lol i do think its a subconscious thing on some level because i was drawn to one of them long before she said anything particularly infjlike but it also makes sense that wed be drawn to people with similar values,YourFriendMaryGrace
if it makes you feel any better participation wasnt exactly voluntary,YourFriendMaryGrace
its really up to you but the original method recommended using as few words as possible and waiting about a week between jumps,YourFriendMaryGrace
btw my very first jump was for new creative ideas and i went from a two year streak of no creative inspiration at all to keeping a notebook with me all the time because the ideas just kept coming,YourFriendMaryGrace
be grateful that you were able to help someone who needed it and trust that the universe will repay you with or without that persons help if you focus your attention on that specific person repaying you you shut out the infinite possibilities of the money coming back to you some other way,YourFriendMaryGrace
resonates as this days energy has been reminding me again and again that i came here to help others i get so lost in the concerns about how to pay the bills how to explain myself to others that i forget how simple my mission ultimately is,YourFriendMaryGrace
im feeling all sorts of shaken up about some conflicts with my parents some financial issues and what feels like a setback in my life and dreams its hard to know where to put my focus and i keep internalizing a lot of guilt and shame but i dont know what to ask exactly general guidance,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much for offering,YourFriendMaryGrace
how did you feel about what you were doing i had a dream where i was trying to distance myself from some girl who was shooting up and for me it was about trying to distance myself from some bad habits i have not heroin lol my habits are legal but still damaging,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think we all use it all the time because its basically just the energy we send out coming back to us eventually but i focused on the belief that the job i really wanted was mine and even though i didnt hear back from them for weeks i got the job another time i was running late for a flight and the line for security was so long there was no way i was gonna make it but i focused on the belief that i would make it and suddenly a tsa agent walked out of a side door and opened up a new line making me have to rush to get my shoes off because i was suddenly second in line,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive also manifested money creative ideas and more feelingsbased things like confidence,YourFriendMaryGrace
the thirty minutes or so before and after my babies were born,YourFriendMaryGrace
helping a woman get away from her boyfriend after i saw him throw her up against his car felt pretty good too im tiny but for some reason he backed down when i told him to,YourFriendMaryGrace
trying to get somewhere in life like,YourFriendMaryGrace
whats your favorite number,YourFriendMaryGrace
what is one of your happy childhood memories,YourFriendMaryGrace
what do you miss the most about having both legs,YourFriendMaryGrace
also and i know this isnt a question but i love you and im glad youre here,YourFriendMaryGrace
give the homeless man more than 3 and some chicken nuggets because hes gonna start telling you that youre a blessing and a light that youre gonna be okay and hes gonna make you feel like you are worthy of being happy so much that as you drive away youll start crying with gratitude and have to pull over just to compose yourself its worth every penny you have on you just to experience the wholesome encouragement of someone who has been through much worse than you yet found peace and joy in just being alive,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you for sharing this ive been having to look at my financial situation and face the fact that ive been irresponsible and impulsive its painful and i have a lot of shameguilt about money that keeps me repeating the same patterns its really nice to see that im not the only one having to look at myself and my actions and take stock of the changes to be made i have a tendency to think that everyone else has it all figured out and im the only one screwing up,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also see that the blame ive been placing on others is actually disempowering me making me feel like it cant be helped and that by owning my mistakes i give myself the agency to do better tough stuff to go through but my hope is that by doing so im preparing for the brighter days ahead,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you both,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is good advice it also helps me to remember that i can never know the full story behind someones motivations i tend to take things personally that might have nothing to do with me using your example maybe people at your sisters church make her feel guilty when she doesnt go maybe shed actually rather help you but shes afraid of being made to feel bad at church maybe she needs the unconditional love you give her more than youll ever know so your being kind about her saying no could be really healing for her and help her stop caring so much what the church people think of her obviously i dont know your sister or her situation so this is a hypothetical but youre right and thank you for sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
trading its something we can start doing on our own and allows just about everyone an equal chance to use their skills and work with what they have i dont know how we can upend the money system in a big speedy way but i think looking for every opportunity to simply stop using it is a great start i once coordinated a wedding for a massage therapist who gave me treatments after each planning session and totally fixed my jacked up shoulders we both felt like we got a great deal,YourFriendMaryGrace
that is a common and enduring myth im not saying you should hate on them just that theres really no such thing as a job anyone can get they only hired 62 of applicants in 2011 and now theyre rolling out automated cashiers so theyll need even fewer human employees,YourFriendMaryGrace
holy yes batman this is huge i was told anger is just justifiable selfrespect that wasnt allowed to express itself in time and i have found it to be true i tended to bottle things up until i exploded often hurting people who werent even the cause of my real pain they were just triggering the same feelings i had tried to suppress for far too long if this sounds like it could be the case for you as well i really recommend the book selftherapy by jay earley just reading the free introduction sample on kindle was kinda lifechanging for me and others whom ive shared it with,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont claim to know anything but my feeling is that the event is an ongoing process of our collective human consciousness expanding and our steady gaining of awareness about the true nature of ourselves and the universe for a great many of us it started soon after the end of 2012 and i think it will continue to gain speed throughout our lives and beyond,YourFriendMaryGrace
so personally i dont anticipate a single day in which everything dramatically changes i think thats perhaps a 3d expectationmisunderstanding that crept into the general public because people correctly sense that things are changing and correctly sense that somethings coming but our limited human understanding of time leads us to get excited about it happening all at once but when i think about it in all the billions and billions of years of eternity a few hundred years or so of awakening on a single planet might as well be all at once does that make sense just my perspective and i may very well be wrong,YourFriendMaryGrace
as far as the burnout goes i dont think theres anything at all wrong with focusing on the down to earth stuff as long as you are tending to your own well being in fact i think getting too swept away by the spiritual chatter can be a frustration and distraction sometimes because everyones experience and purpose here is different its ultimately about discovering and utilizing your inner voice your light and your mission here and that right there is best done in my experience by drowning out everyone else and just letting your truth arise in its own time,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope that helps and if not thats okay too just know that youre loved and cared for by me and many others and youre doing great,YourFriendMaryGrace
one possible interpretation is 54 so the number nine its the number of endings making way for new beginnings,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love this and i love you,YourFriendMaryGrace
look up the shadow man or the hat man dude is seen all over the world,YourFriendMaryGrace
hahaha im glad im not the only one looking around at my life like,YourFriendMaryGrace
hang in there i bet well see each other on the other side of this and be like man we had nothing to worry about,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh thank you for offering ill gladly take you up on that am i making the right decision moving to tn for a while,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit actually just any reading will do i have so many questions about my life that it might be better to leave it openended and see what comes up,YourFriendMaryGrace
are you talking about the op or the video i linked your explanation could work for the op but not sure how it would apply to all the footage in my video,YourFriendMaryGrace
heres another sky anomaly which to me is even more bizarre really cool whatever it is,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is a manmade hypothesis with which he explains away things he does not understand,YourFriendMaryGrace
preach i feel the same way about the phrase just a coincidence,YourFriendMaryGrace
man its been bananas for me too i havent done a tarot for myself lately but my angel card readings  have been pinpoint accurate and yesterday umajorarcanamonk did a reading for me that was super helpful and even echoed some of what my angel cards and dreams have been telling me to a very attentiongrabbing degree,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive started documenting the batterytime number synchronicities on my phone for example ill have 33 battery at 1022pm and theyve been off the charts on wednesday i had nine of these syncs and today im already up to four,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive also been having really intense dreams mostly about emotional baggage related to money family and other crap im ready to let go of now its not exactly pleasurable but i know its a good thing in the long run,YourFriendMaryGrace
the biggest thing im noticing today is a very strong urge to nourish myself i have struggled with disordered eating in the past and even though ive come a long way i still tend to skip meals or just eat a bit of something on the go but today ive been happily going after fruit fruit juice and all the water its nice,YourFriendMaryGrace

sample lyrics life is surrounded by signs if youre connected you know,YourFriendMaryGrace
happy birthday,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow your second paragraph is extremely similar to this remote viewing of mars circa 1 million years bc which was conducted by the cia in the 80s soooo fascinating,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont have any answers for you but i know somewhat how youre feeling i just keep trying to be a light in my day to day life and meditating hoping to be the change i wanna see and all that,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have so many questions its hard to choose so either general guidance or why am i feeling unmotivated or is there something i can do to speed up my manifestations dealers choice ha and thank you as always for sharing your gifts here,YourFriendMaryGrace
holy cow dude congrats this is all kinds of inspiring thank you so much for sharing your story,YourFriendMaryGrace
lord yes a big one i feel like everything is on the line and i dont know what to expect next im gonna be checking in on this thread and sending my comrades at the crossroads lots of abundance vibes with love and light,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey same here i first noticed it following me around when i was a kid and similarly adopted it as my favorite number i hope this full moon is transformative for the both of us in all the best possible ways,YourFriendMaryGrace
heres 27 stars for you,YourFriendMaryGrace
god i hope so i feel like ive been in the throes of labor all summer this gives me hope thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
your weapon against light,YourFriendMaryGrace
huh,YourFriendMaryGrace
ha this is timely because i just did it before checking in here i woke up before dawn due to a really upsetting nightmare about my current situation i walked into the living room and sat down with my phone opened the music app and asked if i made a mistake if the choices ive made that lead to this situation were a mistake i got three little birds by bob marley,YourFriendMaryGrace
woke up this morning smiled with the rising sun three little birds by my doorstep singing sweet songs of melodies pure and true singing this is my message to you dont worry about a thing cause every little thing is gonna be alright,YourFriendMaryGrace
i let it play all the way through and the next song on the shuffle was rhapsody in blue which has long been synonymous with adventure to me and i even used to listen to it in the early morning hours the last time i felt like my life was falling apart id kinda forgotten about it,YourFriendMaryGrace
fwiw ive had encouraging and helpful messages from music for a long time and personally i dont attribute it to this sam but rather my own angelsguides if you try again it might be worthwhile to ask for communication with only those who come in love and light,YourFriendMaryGrace
remindme 6 months,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont want other people to know either but what amazes me is that when i do open up i find that im sooo not alone nearly everybody save for a few very lucky people maybe have needed help from time to time and even wealthy people worry about money because they have loans that are overdue or stocks that crash or because their pal has a bigger summer house lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
for me my fears about money are tied up in worrying that i wont spend it wisely once i have it or that ill get cocky and stop caring about people who are struggling or that ill only make enough to get on my feet but i wont be able to sustain it etc basically a lack of trust in the universe that im gonna be okay today and in the far future but im gonna be okay and you are too,YourFriendMaryGrace
im gonna set a reminder and well check in with each other in six months i bet well have all kinds of amazing new things to share,YourFriendMaryGrace
im in the same boat as you and an affirmation kinda popped in my head a few days ago thats really been helping me money is a tool some need it some dont either way is fine,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know if that helps but its allowing me to shed some layers of shame and to be okay with needing some support right now and i think that shame and fear is the thing thats been holding me back from going for things,YourFriendMaryGrace
i prank called my dad using one of those soundboard sites i was shocked by how completely unimpressed he was like uh huh yeah thats tom hanks voice got it made me see my dad in a different light i guess id never realized hed lived a whole life complete with pranks and shenanigans enough to be bored by my feeble attempt,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats adorable,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like to keep an open mind so i dont have firm beliefs about this but the one that i been contemplating a lot lately is infinite timelines basically at any given moment were living in one of an infinite number of timelines and shifting into different ones constantly without realizing theoretically then mandela effect glitches maybe even ghost sightings would happen when we shift a little further than usual creating discrepancies in our experience of reality,YourFriendMaryGrace
forgiveness takes a lot of strength but its so damn powerful for me it helps to remember that believing that others deserve forgiveness creates a universe in which im worthy of forgiveness too and goodness knows i need it sometimes,YourFriendMaryGrace
it also helps me to remember that everyone has their own unique path and its not going to look like mine and thats more than okay once upon a time i mocked people who meditated and now its a huge part of my life i thought everyone else was an asshole for years before realizing that i was just as much of an asshole  point is people are going to let us down but it doesnt mean theyll never change  and actually being truly kind to them can be the very thing that sets them on the path towards change probably more than youll ever know,YourFriendMaryGrace
just my perspective keep what resonates with you and disregard the rest,YourFriendMaryGrace
you got it i hope you enjoy your new job,YourFriendMaryGrace
same here i remember when it was so tiny and the love and light of it was so unique and still is that it felt really renegade but full of joy like little kids running around playing without adult supervision  gosh i love this place,YourFriendMaryGrace
me too also the way my 4 year old uses the ipad is so wholesome it hurts she would facetime her friends every day if she could but since other people are sometimes busy she also loves to play roblox with me and her dad learn how to do magic tricks color by numbers and fire up some tunes for impromptu dance parties,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know why people think its an eitheror situation she loves being outside reading books painting going places technology is just an extension of the things she enjoys its not at all a replacement,YourFriendMaryGrace
some say horizontal stripes are unflattering but i think he looks very handsome,YourFriendMaryGrace
one time my husband and i took our two little ones on the train to downtown we got off the train one of us holding the 3 year old and the other pushing the baby stroller and walked past a guy who said look at that dad of the year right here i just had to laugh,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats so thoughtful of you i dont know what teens are into these days but i think anything you do will be appreciated maybe a gift card to the neighborhood pizza place or a little themed gift basket like for for a family moviegame night,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think we exist in a stream of infinite timelines and for whatever reason they are merging and collapsing at an increasing rate so theoretically the moment you remembered playing that game with your sister would be a moment in which a timeline where that did happen folded itself into this timeline,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive experienced this as well and i know what you mean by the memory feeling just out of reach i think its because its more like a memory of a memory your brain is trying to reach into a void where that timeline and all its events were once held but theres nothing to latch onto which creates a weird cognitive dissonance along the same lines ive had sooo many glitchy things happen to me which at the time were completely shocking yet ive noticed that unless i write them down immediately within a few days i cant even remember what happened,YourFriendMaryGrace
at any rate welcome to this timeline i brought you a cookie,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow this is exactly what i needed to hear its remarkable how well it fits thank you so much youre very gifted im indeed at the end of an era in my life and i think my blind spot has been thinking i need to check in with everyone else before trusting what i already know my heart is telling me thanks for the empowerment,YourFriendMaryGrace
unless youre in desperate need of the money id say cut your losses and definitely cut contact he may be withholding the money precisely because it keeps you in contact with him if you really need the money pursue it through a third party if at all possible,YourFriendMaryGrace
at any rate im glad youre safe and sound,YourFriendMaryGrace
considering that you explicitly stated you didnt want him to replicate the story i understand you being upset i can also understand not being totally over it and ready to celebrate as if you have nothing to be upset about,YourFriendMaryGrace
however as someone who has been married almost 11 years i highly recommend taking a minute alone to scream cry kick a pillow whatever you need to do to release your frustration and then try to move on and enjoy your evening hes apologized hes trying to make it up to you and a good marriage is one of forgiveness youll be the one apologizing for something sooner or later so extend the grace to him that youd like to receive,YourFriendMaryGrace
also plan your next anniversary birthday etc together its a lot of pressure on your spouse to have to come up with an evening youll both enjoy and placing the responsibility on both your shoulders will prevent a lot of potentially disappointing celebrations,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps congrats on your one year milestone,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey there thank you for sharing your perspective abraham hicks is fully entitled to his opinion as are you personally i dont disagree with the possibility you speak of but i also think theres not a singular correct way to look at dreams our minds are too big too varied and theres no way to say with absolute certainty that a persons dreams are always made for one specific purpose,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have found that after i set a new intention i tend to have vivid dreams set in my past for a few days and lots of emotional conflicts that bubble up i think its because as i adjust to the new reality im creating i have to address and release some old fears and feelings that would otherwise keep me tied to the old reality,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway thats just my two cents and if it didnt resonate with you thats okay i certainly did not mean to be offensive or frustrating to you and if i was i sincerely apologize,YourFriendMaryGrace
i help people interpret their dreams and i lovingly disagree about nightmares predicting the future they certainly can be prophetic but far more often theyre a reflection things that youve already been through and feelings that your subconscious is still trying to process if you or anyone for that matter would like to pm me a dream id be happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to bring to your attention,YourFriendMaryGrace
so cool i had something similar happen where i was meditating and a strange phrase popped into my head i googled it and it turned out to be a lucid dreaming technique id never heard of it never tried to lucid dream i have no idea where that phrase came from at all and soon after i had my first lucid dream its like my subconscious mind was trying to get me to try before i ever consciously considered trying,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway i dont know how these things work i just know that youre not alone and sometimes we somehow know things before we know them,YourFriendMaryGrace
when we first looked at our rental house it was late at night wed just found it on a rental site and wanted to see it in person before calling the property management company the next day our soontobeneighbor was freaked out by our late night appearance and walked over to yell at us being super rude and confrontational i remained calm acting as though i perceived her actions and words to be friendly i wished her merry christmas told her it was nice meeting her smiled etc the way i would have if she really were coming over to make friends,YourFriendMaryGrace
the next time we saw her she was every bit as friendly as i was pretending she was the first time we became friends for real and she ended up being the person who petsit for our animals when we traveled shed bring gifts for my toddlers birthday and baby gifts when my son was born we love her and she and her wife love us,YourFriendMaryGrace
tldr acting as if is a powerful tool ive been successful in transforming peoples anger into kindness many many times this is just one example,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for the offer any insight into my blind spots things i may benefit from paying attention to etc would be lovely  i cant shake the feeling that im missing something,YourFriendMaryGrace

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,YourFriendMaryGrace
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,YourFriendMaryGrace
see  for more info,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have this too theres multiple realities i visit at night and the main thing they have in common is that im married to my same husband but we have no kids which is interesting because we spent the first 6 years of our marriage not planning on having kids but changed our minds and now we have two,YourFriendMaryGrace
the one i visit the most is like a cross between hunger games and the amazing race were racing alongside others through forests and rivers but it doesnt feel fun or even remotely safe it feels like were just trying to survive but with all the alternate realities its like you describe theyre continued storylines and being there always feels normal complete with a memory bank for that particular reality,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a halfbaked theory that our souls or consciousness travel to these places at night and learn lessons like an extra credit or night school program for the things were meant to learn in our daytoday reality,YourFriendMaryGrace
dimetapp was delicious,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have news for you thats called an episiotomy and its very real and very common,YourFriendMaryGrace
let us know next time ill bring drinks,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh its real the cia has declassified multiple documents containing extensive research and experimentation on the phenomena concluding that its not only real but a valuable tool heres just one of many such documents you can find on their site this one  is far more in depth but absolutely fascinating,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope you enjoy the chance to expand your mind once upon a time i thought this stuff was hogwash too im glad i was able to accept that i didnt know everything about how the universe works because its pretty fucking magical and i was really missing out on some cool experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
hugs,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry that happened to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you,YourFriendMaryGrace
general guidance would be greatly appreciated as im at something of a crossroads in my lifethank you so much for sharing your gifts,YourFriendMaryGrace
my 4 year old watched a video about continents recently and asked me which one we were in when i told her we were in north america she thought it was amazing and jumped off the couch and said look at me im standing in north america you gotta try this so i stood up and yelled im standing in north america too its actually really fun and i would recommend it to anyone in any continent,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey look at you go youve manifested a reply so you can find this later,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes love has my back i am gonna make that my affirmation today thank you,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think youre exactly right  weve been feeling like we should move and reach for some new thingsgoals for a while now but kept on maintaining the status quo i love your perspective and i hope this is just the end before a much better beginning,YourFriendMaryGrace
i took your advice and sent a message to the coworker i was concerned about and she was perfectly understanding about my mistake i suggested to my boss a way of avoiding the confusion next time and he thought it was a great idea by the time i left they were both praising my work so i couldnt have asked for a better resolution next time ill do it before i leave to avoid a restless night thanks so much for your wise and very kind words,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much for the vibes i was able to check my phone periodically throughout the work day and felt like i was receiving a warm hug all day long,YourFriendMaryGrace
thank you so much and thank you for creating the loveliest lightest place on the internet,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you too  so dang much,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh this brought tears to my eyes  s such solid wisdom and advice thank you so much it is so helpful and appreciated,YourFriendMaryGrace
beautiful  i cant thank you enough for your focus and energy on my behalf love you brother,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh i cant imagine how tough that must be youve both got all the wishes and good vibes i can muster  and ill keep em coming your way  im always here if you want to pm and just vent or have a virtual shoulder to cry on  big hugs,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry for what youre going through it may not be much but fwiw a random internet stranger is thinking about you and your mom today,YourFriendMaryGrace
id suggest asking your subconscious that very question today and just before going to sleep ask yourself who is this man and how can i make peace with him intend to have a followup dream about this and give it a few days keep in mind that the followup dream may consist of entirely new storylines and symbols so feel free to check in and share any dreams you may have and ill be happy to help,YourFriendMaryGrace
awesome im so glad to hear it was helpful,YourFriendMaryGrace
is the buying of gambling chips in any way notable it dawned on me we didnt actually gamble we just kept buying chips,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes its almost certainly symbolic of a recurring behavior mentality or something along those lines dreams arent big on filler content ha its probably worthwhile to try a little free association with the various elements of the dream and see what first comes to mind,YourFriendMaryGrace
for me gambling immediately calls to mind the word risk but in this case the real risk is in not gambling youve already bought the chips so youre better off playing and possibly winning than just continuing to stockpile chips perhaps the chips represent some leverage or asset youre not using to your advantage in the dating game or at work perhaps you are comparing yourself to others and feeling like your metaphorical pile of chips are inadequate thereby making you feel unworthy of the relationship or career you desire,YourFriendMaryGrace
just a few things to consider,YourFriendMaryGrace
in the dream world your house represents yourself as a whole person taking a shower is symbolic of an emotional cleansing forgiveness spiritual renewal etc its significant that you saw this man before you got in the shower as it would seem to indicate that he represents something or someone who is keeping you from undergoing the emotional and spiritual cleanse that you need its entirely possible that this man is an internal part of yourself its also interesting that he is doing his own thing he isnt actually hurting you but youre afraid that he will,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont think this is about your potential relationship exactly it seems more like your subconscious trying to draw your attention to some fears or perceived threats that are holding you back if that doesnt resonate let me know and im happy to help you examine some other possibilities,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have experience helping people interpret their dreams and would be happy to help you with this one can you provide all the details you can recall including the setting characters colors emotions you felt and so on,YourFriendMaryGrace
buying the chips because the other women were suggests that youre caught in an undesirable feedback loop or that you arent being true to yourself in some way the subconscious mind likes to cast an additional character for each part of yourself that it wants to illustrate so its likely that all three women represent parts of yourself since your subconscious chose single friends specifically it may be a feedback loop within yourself that is keeping you single,YourFriendMaryGrace
the business cards are interesting because you left them in two stacks two is often used to represent the idea of a relationship you put out cards that dont direct people towards yourself but rather your uncle by way of a job he doesnt  even like this seems to be indicating that youre either not putting yourself out there at all or youre putting yourself out there in a way that is ultimately directing people away from you,YourFriendMaryGrace
dream interpretation works best as a collaborative process so do let me know what does and doesnt resonate with you and im happy to help you hone in on what your subconscious is trying to process,YourFriendMaryGrace
wowwwww dude i cant even tell you how much this applies to me right now theres two loved ones in particular who deserve my love and support right now but ive been withdrawn and i dont know why thank you so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
also i got your message at 1111am and theres 33 comments in your post time for me to pay attention,YourFriendMaryGrace
general guidance please thank you so much for your kind offer,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for taking me seriously i felt pretty selfconscious posting this i  dont remember what the deals were exactly but i had a series of  past life dreams after this experience that were intensely vivid they felt more like memories than dreams i never saw what i looked like but all my friends looked like the guy i saw in my living room we lived on a spaceship that was small but expandable like additional rooms could just kind of materialize at the push of a button,YourFriendMaryGrace
the feeling i had with them was total love and support we were workers who spread love and light everywhere we went we zipped around and took meetings with aliens who worked for the dark side so to speak we never fought with them though we just used a kind of telepathy to determine if they were willing to work with us and maybe even become less dark if they were i or one of my buddies would teleport to their ship and negotiate,YourFriendMaryGrace
eventually i got bored and wanted to try something harder so i heard that the planet earth was in trouble and needed volunteers to come and spread the light by being loving and forgiving i was told that id need to be careful not to hurt anyone i thought huh why would i ever do that its hard to explain but the dimension or atmosphere of this place i was in made it really easy to be loving all the time i was really naive like i couldnt possibly understand how much id be hurt in this life and how much id hurt others as well they tried to tell me but i just couldnt comprehend it and i was too excited about the adventure of it all,YourFriendMaryGrace
the idea was that theyd basically upload my consciousness into a baby and my next memory is being in the womb already able to sense how painful and difficult it is to be here thinking oh no i dont want to do this anymore but it was too late the dreams came to a screeching halt after that but i dont mind because if and i realize thats a big if this is at all true my focus needs to be on this life i chose and work i signed up for,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit interesting side note my whole life ive had a recurring thought that i wish i hadnt been born id have this thought a lot even in the happy times but ever since i saw my old friend and had all these dreams ive found myself thinking that im glad i was born honestly this all feels very real to me but either way its been a blessing,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh im gonna sound completely insane but fck it not an abduction but i saw an alien in my living room about a month ago  he was blue with an enormous mushroom shaped noggin i didnt feel afraid though as he looked strangely familiar like an old friend i thought to myself why am i seeing this guy and the answer was telepathic saying you made some deals before you came here i understood this to mean that i knew him in a past life and had done him some favors so he was going to help me out in this life in some way then he disappeared,YourFriendMaryGrace
it was bizarre obviously but somehow really comforting i actually got emotional thinking about it the next day,YourFriendMaryGrace
winona ryder it has no effect on my life except for randomly being told i look like winona ryder from time to time,YourFriendMaryGrace

beautiful thank you for sharing my brother has autism and i am a better person for having grown up with him he got a job bussing tables and my dad had to teach him about paying bills because he just wanted to give all his money away  im so glad you and kyle found each other,YourFriendMaryGrace
ueateroflife283 remotely viewed you order food last week you picked your side and it was mashed potatoes,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome and its not a dumb question at all its normal to second guess things especially when feelings are involved i hope you have a good time on your date,YourFriendMaryGrace
i sort of naturally believed in the loa as a child for example my mom took me to see the play annie when i was about five years old and i became obsessed i pretended to be starring in annie all the time and would practice as if id already been cast when i turned 10 just the right age for the part i saw an ad for annie auditions in my hometown newspaper and i got the part,YourFriendMaryGrace
rediscovering the loa as an adult i found it harder to act as if but i basically use the same techniques of imagining myself in the scenario i intend to manifest so far so good,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre welcome im only able to offer this advice because i struggle with the same things and becoming aware of it has been helping me a lot you got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
when my daughter was three she used to tell us all kinds of stories about when daddy was a little boy always from the perspective of an adult i tried to ask her about when mommy was a little girl and she said she didnt know she also said that her baby brother was her brother before but he was a girl,YourFriendMaryGrace
youd probably enjoy checking out rpastlives if you havent already theres some cool stories there,YourFriendMaryGrace
i believe you mac have you read about the mandela effect,YourFriendMaryGrace
you and op should check out rprecognition  youre definitely not alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
and i just read this comment at 1133,YourFriendMaryGrace
i manifested a very positive conversation with my boss i really like him but he was a jerk recently and it was pretty upsetting i focused on projecting love and forgiveness towards him until the next time we worked together and the whole drive to work that morning i tried to feel grateful for the best possible outcome of the situation,YourFriendMaryGrace
truthfully i wanted to tell him he was wrong but something in my mind told me that i should ask what i could be doing better instead so i did and he immediately responded with an apology for the way hed acted said that it wasnt my fault and that hes very happy with my work i cant even tell you how unlikely it seemed that hed ever acknowledge he was a jerk much less apologize im so thankful and surprised it was also a learning experience for me to keep an open mind about people and to stay humble and be willing to be part of the solution rather than assume theyll never change,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really like all of rgarbagedolly advice heres a few things that jumped out to me in your post and responses,YourFriendMaryGrace
unnecessary limitations theres a lot of ways to make money besides being a massage therapist or a server so starting your own business doesnt have to be an allornothing situation unless you make it one try and open yourself up to many possibilities for earning a living and see what comes up because the possibilities are endless i have a part time job a small business and a hobby that sometimes pays and i love this combo because its never monotonous and i dont have to strictly rely on any one thing in order to have income ive also found that even though the jobs are in fairly different fields i still get clientscontacts through one job that end up being business for another,YourFriendMaryGrace
negative motivations its hard to get excited about something if theres shame attached and theres definitely some shame in the motivation to finally get out of your parents house it has the implication that youve been there too long you should have reached full independence by now etc which are making you feel bad every time you think about this goal thats supposed to bring you joy youre doing great and theres no real shame whatsoever in living with family at your age so try to focus on moving out for the most fun and uplifting reasons,YourFriendMaryGrace
externallyplaced identity i get the impression that you feel like you need money success a home etc to feel like youre enough but you were worthy of existing on the day you were born and you didnt bring a single one of those things with you the same is true for you now it just doesnt feel like it because of over time were conditioned to think the most important thing we can do is make money theres nothing wrong with the goal of financial success but please dont measure your worth as a person that way you have much to offer just as you are and were all lucky to have you here,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you and im pulling for you keep us updated as you experience the sunrise in your  new beginnings,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont think youre crazy but i do think youre freaking out for no reason  theres no chance ive been pregnant the past month and ive been seeing 333 like crazy our reality is an unpredictable place so i would ease up on the assumption that this is a sign youre having a baby ime its more likely to be a little pat on the back saying youre doing great you are loved than a prophecy,YourFriendMaryGrace
that being said the thing i recommend the most is the power of positive thinking believe that if you have another child it will be a very special child that has been planning to be with you since before you were even born believe that you will have more than enough resources and time to raise another little one believe that you are in the middle of something so much greater than yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
we were practically homeless when i got pregnant with my oldest and for a month or two i wasted so many tears worrying about how things could possibly work out we had to move to a new city and get different jobs etc but in the end we were able to provide for her better than i could have imagined not only that but the sacrifices we made in order to take care of her ended up putting us in a far better position to reach the very goals wed been trying and failing to achieve for years we thought we needed to hit all these goalposts before we could have a baby and it ended up being the other way around so take a deep breath and know that the universe is working in your favor baby or no baby,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is great how long does it take you to animate about one minute worth of video in this style,YourFriendMaryGrace
id love to will do so shortly,YourFriendMaryGrace
careful with that your thoughts are very powerful and if there is a satan hed like nothing more than to make you feel afraid especially when you might be on the verge of some beautiful experiences ive been seeing repeating numbers a lot more recently and i try to remember to mentally express love and gratitude every time assuming that the numbers are a positive sign and guess what ive had extraordinarily good luck lately and so many things ive been working towards for years are just falling into place all of the sudden,YourFriendMaryGrace
for every good thing that can happen to you you can find someone on the internet telling you its a bad thing you and only you can allow the energy within yourself to skew negative or positive so if you think youve got an evil entity in yourself you might as well have one simply declare yourself free of their control and you are free declare yourself open to the influences of love and light and expect miracles to believe that youre a helpless victim of darkness is to throw away your tremendous personal power and to miss out on opportunities for a happier life,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps im posting this at 1222pm and i feel great about it  dont worry be happy,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is just one of a dozen or so websites that collect near death experience stories of course you gotta decide for yourself what to believe but it certainly makes for some interesting reading,YourFriendMaryGrace
passionate empathetic and creative certainly describes me in fact i was working on illustrating a childrens book when i got your message ha thanks so much for the reading its a very cool gift that you have,YourFriendMaryGrace
based on the information id say shes genuinely interested in you,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you dont mind me asking at what age did you develop this or did you always have it i used to nanny for a little guy from age 23 who would tell me what color i was after i had a miscarriage he had no idea why i was sad but he started telling me i was gray  i moved away 5 years ago but ive always wondered if he was seeing my aura and what color hed see from me now,YourFriendMaryGrace
check out the sub rprecognition and youll see this phenomenon is pretty common when i was 11 years old i dreamt about the grisly specifics of my pet rabbits untimely death a few days before it happened been trying to understand the nature of reality ever since,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps im so sorry about your pup,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit spelling,YourFriendMaryGrace
so much food for thought here  this is something ive been learning a lot about recently and i feel like its a vitally important topic for our whole society,YourFriendMaryGrace
i really respect your courage and honesty  anger is something weve all felt but many are afraid to talk about because its not considered a good emotion to have we learn from a young age that only the bad kids get angry and this shaming is reflected in the subsequent years as we become conditioned to choke it out lock it in a cage but there is no part of ourselves that can stay locked up forever just like you described eventually the banished emotion escapes and then youre dealing with the anger of the situation at hand plus an eruption of backlogged anger,YourFriendMaryGrace
but it doesnt have to be this way anger when properly integrated is just a calm steady voice of justifiable selfrespect its a small but powerful flame within that gives us the courage to ask for a raise firmly assert boundaries and protect the vulnerable when we accept that anger is a natural emotion just doing its best to protect the self or others were able to harness the selfrespecting motivation behind it and express it lovingly as soon as we feel disrespected its much much easier to keep your cool if you address what youre feeling long before you get hot,YourFriendMaryGrace
i tell my kids its okay to be angry but you cant hurt anybody and i even suggest punching a pillow stomping etc sometimes because i firmly believe that anger has to be allowed to be released i actually did a therapy session recently where i found myself screaming fuck you into a pillow over some things that happened back in high school i couldnt believe how much lighter calmer and more forgiving i felt and still feel after that crazy stuff id unknowingly been carrying that rage around with me for 18 years,YourFriendMaryGrace
point is your anger isnt shameful its just ready to be let out of the cage so it can become the loving safe and wellintegrated tool its meant to be just my two cents take what resonates and leave the rest behind much love to you my brother  keep it up,YourFriendMaryGrace
you mean these books i grew up with this set and just started reading them with my own kids,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats thankfully a myth dying in a dream is not uncommon but it is usually something that happens in symbolicmetaphorical dreams and is meant to illustrate some aspect of your emotional life,YourFriendMaryGrace
i would categorize this as a precognitive dream which is surprisingly common as well check out rprecognition for many similar accounts glad youre okay,YourFriendMaryGrace
i pay attention to the feelings i get while considering the action if following him on ig makes you feel excited nervous in a good way joyful etc do it if you feel unpleasantly anxious or conflicted about it wait for the next possible action and see how that feels,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry you went through that  sounds terrifying youve got such an encouraging and uplifting vibe im really thankful youre okay,YourFriendMaryGrace
your story is bound to be controversial because money is a loaded topic to begin with and its such an unexpected twist to the almost died storyline most people will probably be watching expecting to see you speak on a newfound appreciation for life and then your taking the money will seem shallow in comparison but anyone who has been greatly in need of 100 raises hand knows that the gratitude you feel once youre struggling a little bit less is anything but shallow,YourFriendMaryGrace
and none of us can say how wed react unless weve been in your shoes so dont let the criticism upset you at the same time i do suggest being willing to consider how you might have responded differently not because you did anything bad but because every moment of our lives is a sliding door to other possibilities and we can learn so much from considering the other paths we might have taken you shouldnt feel any guilt or shame though you are beautiful and deserving of everything good,YourFriendMaryGrace
me toobut i also feel like the exhaustion and discomfort arent bad but rather temporary symptoms of having shifted in some way i was meditating last night and i quickly started to feel a really pleasant tinglingvibration the phrase ancient upgrades came to mind and i saw a 2d shape thats been coming to my mind and puzzling me since i was a child the shape started to turn into a 3d construction project being built in ancient times which was so cool aaaand then my son woke up and i had to snap out of it and go be mommy,YourFriendMaryGrace
tldr i wonder if something leveled up in our dna or consciousness last night that were energetically adapting to today,YourFriendMaryGrace
its a great sign it means youre on the right track in addition many believe its a sign from your angels or guides that theyre with you and proud of you you can google angel number and the numbers you keep seeing and read multiple interpretations but i think its important to remember that only you can sense the true meaning because whatever you see is for you and specific to your experience,YourFriendMaryGrace
you might want to try posting this on rretconned as theres some really interesting discussions over there about geography changes,YourFriendMaryGrace
rlostreddditors  slaying isnt quite what were about here,YourFriendMaryGrace
its funny you mention aliens though because a few nights ago i dreamt of an alien invasion everyone was terrified including me but i intuitively knew that wishing them harm was the only way they could get me i focused all my energy on sending them love and light and it was like they had no choice but to pass on by not only was i safe my loving intentions made me uninteresting to them because provoking anger and fear is how they get their kicks,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit by they i mean this specific group i think the vast majority of aliens are benevolent,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh wow when i wrote the other comment i had no idea that you were the same person i responded to here i read sooo many posts but feel compelled to respond to relatively so few of them its crazy that i inadvertently reached out to you twice you and i must be on the same wavelength,YourFriendMaryGrace
im honestly not sure why but i felt like i should delete my other comment and resend it via pm so i deleted it but i hadnt sent the pm yet if youre open to it id love to talk more about these newold friends of ours,YourFriendMaryGrace
im on board if youre interested in illustrations,YourFriendMaryGrace
oh my goodness youve made my day i appreciate and love you so much too and im here for you anytime,YourFriendMaryGrace
its not vain to see your own power and potential its beautiful and essential that you do you are one of the greats embrace it life is long and sometimes its really hard but if you can learn to appreciate the hard times as a trial by fire a chance to burn off the things that are no longer serving your highest potential so that you can grow into something much greater youll soon come out on the other side like a phoenix born from ashes,YourFriendMaryGrace
you mentioned getting your whole self to cooperate and i truly get what you mean i highly recommend this book even if you only read the free sample youll get a lot of helpful realizations,YourFriendMaryGrace
the idea is that as we go through life experiences of trauma sadness etc parts of our truest selves go into hiding while other parts of ourselves spring up to put up defences and barriers to try and stop the wounded selves from getting hurt again these bodyguard parts of self only have good intentions for you they want to protect you but sometimes theyre misguided or no longer needed,YourFriendMaryGrace
for example you have a bodyguard part of yourself thats telling you youre tired and its safer to stay in bed if you view that part of self like hes bad it only doubles down on the hurt and fear hes already feeling you have to be thankful for his efforts love him assure him that you are safe and gently tell him that he can move along now,YourFriendMaryGrace
tldr love forgive and appreciate every single part of yourself even or especially the parts that you dont want to be anymore and they will dissipate and reintegrate back into the whole making you into a new and improved version of yourself you got this,YourFriendMaryGrace
hugs youre never alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
i see a lot of selfdefeating assumptions in your post such as the assumption that your brain is wired to be negative you have a beautiful brain its just in need of a little makeover,YourFriendMaryGrace
you can change anything you want and changing your way of thinking is one of the easier things to change if you dont meditate its time to start my brain is very active always going and going so i really understand what its like to feel stuck in a negative thought loop meditation trains your brain to slow down and starting with just a few minutes a day can make a noticeable difference in less than a week so start there,YourFriendMaryGrace
next write down some positive affirmations and try and think of them every single time you catch yourself having a negative thought you dont have to believe the statements are true  just start thinking about them and they will start to become your reality heres a few of my favorite affirmations,YourFriendMaryGrace
the worst is behind me,YourFriendMaryGrace
im doing a great job,YourFriendMaryGrace
im safe and loved,YourFriendMaryGrace
everything is going well for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a lot to look forward to,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love everyone,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have an abundance of money,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have an abundance of energy,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have an abundance of love,YourFriendMaryGrace
im really blessed,YourFriendMaryGrace
i also recommend thinking thank you and i love you as much as possible you can direct your love and gratitude to yourself random strangers the universe whatever you want just practice feeling love and gratitude especially on the tough days,YourFriendMaryGrace
i love you and im here for you anytime,YourFriendMaryGrace
plaaahstaahk lol my brother and i loved this movie and loved to imitate his weird pronunciations,YourFriendMaryGrace
your associations make perfect sense to me in case its helpful heres my thoughts on few of them,YourFriendMaryGrace
mario kart maybe about how you are navigating through life or the games you play socially at work etc to get ahead,YourFriendMaryGrace
toilets could represent your thoughts feelings about what youre producing with your current life or something you andor others are trying to keep hidden,YourFriendMaryGrace
belly of the serpent makes me think of the wolf in sheeps clothing but its a man in snakes clothing and it feels like a trap does that parallel to a feeling you have sometimes like you have no choice but to appear threatening,YourFriendMaryGrace
shark in the water water often represents emotions the shark could be an angry part of yourself or an emotional threat of some kind,YourFriendMaryGrace
shopping centers often represents how you are presenting yourself or how you see yourself in relation to society,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you have any more recurring characters thinking of your immediate associations with the people in your dreams or the recalling type of person you were back when you spent the most time with them might be helpful for identifying which parts of yourself the dream is trying to resolve for example you mentioned the exgirlfriend dreams perhaps theres a part of yourself thats still stuck in those days waiting to be reintegrated so for instance if you felt like you were selfish back then forgiving yourself and your mistakes would probably soothe those particular dreams away,YourFriendMaryGrace
well i for one dont think youre crazy imo its entirely possible that scientists there and elsewhere are doing all kinds of crazy stuff that isnt disclosed to the general public but regardless of whether or not our universe is being tampered with i think the most important part of your comment is this,YourFriendMaryGrace
he believed it was absolutely crucial that people need to hold true and not lose themselves,YourFriendMaryGrace
i believe that too and i think people are doing it all on their own its amazing how many people myself included are actually living better and happier lives since experiencing these alternate dimension type dreams glitches etc and even though the recent batch of shared dreams were apocalyptic the underlying theme was that the dreamers felt calm and knew there was no reason to be afraid thats beautiful and worth taking to heart,YourFriendMaryGrace
all of this to say dont worry be happy personally i believe theres an awakening force of love and light rolling in and its unstoppable,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont think it sounds stupid at all and i think your mom is blessed to have you in her life  my advice is to lead by example try new things and pass along the things that you find helpful heres my goto daily list for improving my mind and body complete with an acronym swem,YourFriendMaryGrace
supplement getting all the vitamins and nutrients i need either through food alone or food  supplements,YourFriendMaryGrace
water staying hydrated,YourFriendMaryGrace
exercise hitting the gym doing thirty minutes of yoga or even just dancing around the living room is great for my overall energy and mood,YourFriendMaryGrace
meditate i try and do at least ten minutes a day,YourFriendMaryGrace
these are just a few ideas but the point is to take care of good yourself and talk to your mom about the benefits youre experiencing wishing you both all the best,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats amazing im in a private subreddit and the same thing happened huge influx of powerful dreams reported friday morning,YourFriendMaryGrace
seeing the little ordinary daily life things in places like this fill me with existential dread someone washed that coffee mug set it on the wire rack to dry and then what where did they go,YourFriendMaryGrace
are you serious im so glad you shared this i cant wait to read more,YourFriendMaryGrace
he said he doesnt remember any colors in particular do you,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like the shared dream idea  i hadnt thought of that sometimes i wonder if our consciousness have experiences in alternate dimensions while our body is sleeping its as if some really crappy universes were destroyed and yall were all there for the end of those particular times somehow knowing that it wasnt the end of you,YourFriendMaryGrace
first of all im sorry youre feeling this way it sounds like youre under a lot of stress and some old wounds are feeling raw its understandable that youd be upset but keep breathing and know that everything is going to be okay,YourFriendMaryGrace
the idea behind those dimensional jumping methods is that we can shape our reality if thats true then its not really possible for you to jump into the wrong dimension unless you decide that it is and if you did decide that you jumped into the wrong dimension you could simply jump into a better one,YourFriendMaryGrace
are you familiar with the law of attraction its the same general idea but instead of trying to jump straight from one version of your life to another you set the intention to have certain changes come into your life ive had success with both approaches and i think its really just about deciding what you want for yourself and then moving forward with the assumption that your desires are already manifesting,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you want to speed up the process then expect the best practice feeling love towards yourself and others and be grateful for everything good in your life no matter how small its pretty mindblowing how many wonderful things you can attract,YourFriendMaryGrace
beautiful the number 27 has been my favorite since i was a child it wasnt until i turned 27 that i learned its my grandmothers favorite number as well its a very special number,YourFriendMaryGrace
truthfully i dont know what it is i dont really have a belief system about this i just observe correlations and look for patterns and sometimes i notice that the people around me and everywhere i look online seem to be experiencing some very specific things within a 36 hour or so block of time this time around it was people who dont normally remember their dreams having vivid dreams people unexpectedly reconnecting with someone they lost touch with and random good things happening to people,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you dont mind sharing what was your dream about,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so very sorry about your friend its a sad irony that depression can make us hide away from the very people who love us and are willing to help im sure you meant more to scott than youll ever know,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you remember what it was about,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre never alone,YourFriendMaryGrace
anytime you wanna get stuff off your chest please dont hesitate to pm me i dont judge and id be honored to provide listening ear,YourFriendMaryGrace
what the what my husband had that exact same dream heres another one  and another,YourFriendMaryGrace
mazel tov gay jesus,YourFriendMaryGrace
whoa wouldnt it be cool if that plays out in reality its like we got some kind of system upgrade that improved relationships and circumstances,YourFriendMaryGrace
did the logo appear yesterday by chance it seems like a whole bunch of people myself included shifted to a better timelineuniverse sometime thursday night,YourFriendMaryGrace
this has happened to me before i saw my face morph into the faces of dozens of old women and their faces reflected the emotion i was feeling in that exact moment for example i started to feel anxious and my face became the face of a woman who was anxious her whole life when i calmed down and felt happy i saw the face of a woman who was at peace her whole life,YourFriendMaryGrace
i believe its a function of the third eye ancient cultures throughout time were well aware of the abilities of the third eye but in modern times its less common for people to hear about it so when it activates we dont know whats going on the brain is a fascinating and complex machine capable of all kinds of amazing things stay positive and start meditating if you havent already done so youre in for some beautiful experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry youre dealing with this my friend it sounds awful its possible that theyre going through something thats making them feel angry and aggressive and not telling you about it i would try and get them talking about it at a time when everyone is calm and happy tell them that you dont understand what changed and that the constant fighting is breaking your spirit be honest and express your feelings with love and gentleness be open to the possibility that they are just hurting i think theres a lot of truth to the phrase people who are hurting hurt people,YourFriendMaryGrace
beyond that do what you can to create a port in the storm go to your room and listen to binaural beats meditate intend to have a healing experience with them intend for them to have healing experiences on their own practice hooponopono  and direct the energy to them know that you are safe and loved im always here anytime you want to chat,YourFriendMaryGrace
forgive yourself love yourself and be patient we all have painful experiences that can leave us stuck in negative thought cycles you arent thinking bad thoughts because youre bad at this youre thinking that because youve been hurt so getting mad at yourself is just doubling down on the hurt youre already feeling does that make sense,YourFriendMaryGrace
try this whenever these ughhhh thoughts come up respond to yourself with positive affirmations like im doing a great job or im a beautiful person inside and out or im thankful for how i look its okay if you dont necessarily feel like theyre true just yet by replacing the negative thoughts with positive ones youll begin a healing  process and raise your vibrations to a level where you can receive the gifts youre asking for know that you are deserving of all gifts and practice feeling grateful for the beauty that is already manifesting for you,YourFriendMaryGrace
1 stay hydrated,YourFriendMaryGrace
2 look for every opportunity to make someones day a little better,YourFriendMaryGrace
3  practice hooponopono,YourFriendMaryGrace
4 take a break from reading the news and social media,YourFriendMaryGrace
5 text a friend just to say youre glad theyre in your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
youre not crazy and theres nothing to worry about think of it like a little wink from the universe letting you know youre on the right track theres no real reason for it to be ominous all kinds of amazing things could happen to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
this comment reminded me of this song that i love to listen to when i feel low because it lets me express my sadness and loss before celebrating all that i have,YourFriendMaryGrace
i got my arms got my hands got my fingers got my legs got my feet got my toes got my liver got my blood ive got life ive got my freedom ive got life,YourFriendMaryGrace
dont worry about the rockstar example i should have worded my suggestion better,YourFriendMaryGrace
the method is just to gain confidence by pretending youre already confident imagine yourself as youd like to be perceived by others and then imagine that youre already being perceived that way as you go about your day we all put out energy to others all the time anyway be it anxious shy agitated whatever this is just the act of consciously altering your energy as you get used to the idea of projecting confidence or any characteristic really real confidence begins to grow underneath,YourFriendMaryGrace
think of it like exercise first you decide you want to be able to run 5 miles and eventually you will but it starts with jogging around the block,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think its just the way you go about it you can be confident and also be warm and inclusive,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey there just checking in after a little reddit hiatus im so glad my response was helpful fwiw the free of charge bit in my title was a joke  i never charge so please feel free to comment or pm me your dreams any time i relate to some of your experiences and would be happy to help however i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
love it,YourFriendMaryGrace
walk into the room pretending to be super famous and that everyone wants to talk to you you dont have to 100 believe it just keep mentally projecting the confidence of a rockstar and see what happens its pretty crazy how heads start to turn try it and see,YourFriendMaryGrace
okay thank you for the solid advice kind stranger my children are quite little ages 1 and 4 so they are far more into stuff like swimming roblox dinosaurs and impromptu dance parties than anything i could possibly say on this subreddit,YourFriendMaryGrace
but i feel ya i was raised in a very religious household and when i grew up and felt differently about religion than my parents it was really tough and i didnt know how to tell them so i hope very much that my children never feel like im pushing my personal beliefs onto them i dont feel as though i need them to be interested in or even aware of what i think about the universe i just want them to feel as safe happy and loved as i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps what are your thoughts on this if i may ask i dont like to argue on the internet but i am always up for a friendly discussion,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope you have a good day,YourFriendMaryGrace
ha because i let them watch willy wonka or because their mom enjoys pondering theoretical and practical applications of physical science either way i love you i really do,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks so much for sharing and congrats on the lucidity ive only had a lucid dream once and i decided to fly right away haha that was just a few months ago so im hoping it happens again soon,YourFriendMaryGrace
im eager to hear the message of this dream if you dont mind sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
im glad you asked this is a pretty common one so dont feel bad  a quick way to figure this one out might be to ask yourself what do i feel guilty about,YourFriendMaryGrace
the accidentally cheated dreams can come from the feeling that youre spending too much time on work video games thinking about other people and so on  in other words the dreams may not be about actually cheating with a girl at all but rather some other form of letting her down or simply a fear of letting her down does that help,YourFriendMaryGrace
how strange they say that we often dream of stores as a snapshot of how were considering presenting ourselves in society in that light this might be a dream about feelings of society being past its prime holding nothing new for you and yet creepily keeping tabs on you just the same however childrens dreams are a bit no more difficult to translate because childrens associations can be so different from adults,YourFriendMaryGrace
so a good way to figure this one out might be to try and think of your life at the age you had these dreams and what your associations with stores might have been if not place i go to get stuff i need to function in society maybe place my parents take me or place i might get lost then think about the imagery and feelings you had against that backdrop,YourFriendMaryGrace
let me know what you think,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey thats not a bad thing my husband is the same way i have vivid and memorable dreams almost nightly and his memorable dreams are few and far between maybe one or two a year,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have a theory about this totally unproven hes a really extroverted feeler like hes able to process his emotions very well and speak to what hes feeling in the moment whereas i tend to try and avoid thinking about my feelings and sometimes i keep em suppressed and unprocessed until they come out in the form of dreams so ive wondered if those who dont remember their dreams tend to be able to process and express their emotions on the fly what say you,YourFriendMaryGrace
first of all and hope this is okay to say but id love to see this as a scene in a movie,YourFriendMaryGrace
as with any dream you should trust your instincts on this one your spiritual journey is your own beautifully unique thing so ill leave the spiritual interpretations up to you disregard anything that isnt resonant but heres what i see in the emotional intelligence of the dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
the setting of the girls house may be uniquely significant if she was a real girl you know if it was a random girl then the setting seems to me to be conveying that this dream is illustrating in part how you feel about yourself in societyin relation to others,YourFriendMaryGrace
the thing that sticks out to me the most is that the painful feeling manifests immediately after being shushed by your mom you were just sharing your thoughts hurting no one and she made you feel as though you were doing something wrong your confidence was undermined and you werent able to truly stand up for yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
the punched in the gut feeling is one of painful shame and sadness and personally i often feel it when ive done nothing wrong i onlyfear that i have does that sound like what you expedience its a sickening feeling for me and one im only just starting to realize that i dont deserve to feel that so much of the time many many of us get traumatized by feeling shame in front of others at a young age or any age and then long after the critical condescending or angry voices that made us feel that way are no longer around we still feel the affects of them and for some it feels like what we call social anxiety and depression its exactly the kind of stuck emotions that are the subconscious 1 job to make better but it all needs to be consciously processed before the healing can begin so vivid dreams are born from that subconscious effort to help you know what you are feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
tldr  perhaps you have difficulty speaking your feelings and beliefs due to some negative conditioning,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps what are the six orbs of energy and whats your interpretation of the parable,YourFriendMaryGrace
dont want to intrude upon your own way of looking at the dream because as always you are the best interpreter of your dreams its most likely to be a culmination of the things youre experiencing and feeling so above all else trust your instincts,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is a good one its fascinating that you were in the backyard because in dreamland backyards often represent childhood and the past experiences now behind us its as if this dream was meant to be brought with you into adulthood which certainly warrants a closer look,YourFriendMaryGrace
to interpret a childs dream it helps to think like you did as a child bees can represent transformation as in the honeymaking process community collaboration hard work etc but to a child the association may be as simple as thing that might hurt me,YourFriendMaryGrace
hands are usually symbolic of the work that we do whether its a child building block towers and cutting paper shapes or an adult doing the dishes and having a job we use our hands but they can also symbolize our lifes work our true calling and the fact that this dream has stayed with you leads me to think this is the case,YourFriendMaryGrace
to be bitten in a dream typically indicates feeling attacked vulnerable leeched off of or some other form of threat but whats interesting is that you feel no pain almost as if your hands were prepared for this,YourFriendMaryGrace
to be perfectly honest i dont know what this dream is saying but if i were to guess the message id say its something like nothing can stop you from doing what you came here to do,YourFriendMaryGrace
wow imo this was your inner self coming through with a powerfully important message thanks so much for sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
its my pleasure and thanks for being willing to share some of your dreams,YourFriendMaryGrace
my first instinct is that the house at least in the first dream speaks to some feelings about growing up with your mom but its just as likely to be about your family as a whole and yourself in relation to them the age of yourself in the dream indicates that this is about lingering effects of the younger yous experiences the woman selling the house may represent parts of your moms psyche the subconscious tends to add an additional character for each part of someones personality that it wants to illustrate,YourFriendMaryGrace
bathrooms are where we tend to our most private and sometimes unpleasant business and in dreams they usually represent much the same thing the things we dont want anyone to know or see and arent a part of our public persona so its possible that theres some family drama that was kept under wraps or aspects of your familys life that were kept from you or some other form of private pain that you havent properly processed and healed from it might be pain that you experienced as a child and felt like you shouldnt tell anyone,YourFriendMaryGrace
looking out a window typically symbolizes your view of the world or in this case the way you looked at world in the time of your life that this dream is meant to illustrate the broken down amusement park seems to say joy is gone the colorful abandoned houses may be colorful parts of yourself that you lost when you were younger or colorful parts of your family life that were ruined somehow the fact that your family is happy with the view unaware of your feelings of dread makes me think that you are the one who died in private murdered by the stranger who might still be in the house the fact that he might still be in the house suggests that your pain felt inescapable and maybe still does,YourFriendMaryGrace
the attic represents your highest thoughts which often means spirituality forgotten or undiscovered parts of a house is a very common dream metaphor and it means that theres a part of yourself that youve lost touch with the childhood friend and her family are probably parts of yourself that you lost when you were a child and stopped spending time in this part of your spiritual life as a result its very powerful imagery and its more hopeful than it probably feels within the dream there are hidden rooms within all of us just waiting to be enjoyed again theyve just been boarded up with pain we arent ready to face again,YourFriendMaryGrace
please dont feel discouraged by the darkness of these dreams its not indicative of anything youre doing wrong or not doing well enough i keep recommending this book for precisely this reason its helped me to understand that each and every bad self within us isnt even bad its just a defensive bodyguard self that is protecting a wounded little child self children need to be able to express their feelings and receive unconditional love and support but when that inevitably fails to happen a little piece of that child remains stuck in those bad feelings and a defensive self develops to try and stop you from reliving that pain,YourFriendMaryGrace
as with any dream interpretation this one is subject to my own projections and experiences so i want to stress that you are the best interpreter of your dreams if any of that resonates awesome and the things that dont quite feel right are your subconscious telling you thats not it keep thinking i find that by pondering the interpretations that do feel right and then thinking about them in relation to the parts that are still confusing me things start to click into place and make sense overall,YourFriendMaryGrace
please dont hesitate to follow up with questions other dreams etc im truly happy to help however i can,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats beautiful its a lot like what people who participate in the therapeutic mdma trials say  that they got to know themselves underneath all the barriers theyve built up and that in itself is a catalyst for continued healing,YourFriendMaryGrace
im glad my comment was helpful i was hesitant about posting it because the last thing i want to do is derail your positive experience by projecting my own beliefs onto it its really cool that it resonates with what you felt thanks again for sharing it was helpful for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
your ankles are lovely,YourFriendMaryGrace
just my personal opinion but i think the concept of a higher self that is somehow removed or above the self is a misunderstanding ive been reading about the therapeutic mdma trials and one thing that seems to come out for everyone is a healing self within that is benevolent and somehow unaffected by the trauma of our lives it knows who we are and who we might be without the trauma weighing us down i call it the inner self or highest self because to me thinking of it as a separate entity leaves me feeling like i have to appeal to it or beckon it somehow i think its the same self that creates the dreams which bring us clarity about our emotional lives to be clear i do believe we have angels guides whatever you want to call them i just think the higher self is within and not in any way better than us because it is us,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway thanks for sharing your session its a gift to be able to read others experiences,YourFriendMaryGrace
gosh this made me sad its late at night and im up holding my baby boy who is sick and started thinking of him wanting to see me not being able to talk to me idk where im even going with this except to say im sorry and i hope she gets out soon,YourFriendMaryGrace
virtual mom hug,YourFriendMaryGrace
ps i believe you,YourFriendMaryGrace
dreams like this usually happen to people who are thinking aboutpreparing to give birth to an idea a new venture of some kind etc,YourFriendMaryGrace
isnt it amazing how much we can intuitively realize seemingly out of nowhere im starting to think there was a recent know thyself upgrade in this universe ha i keep bumping into people online and irl who are also finding peace through sudden clarity into their psyche,YourFriendMaryGrace
and thank you same to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is something ive been thinking about too ive been reading this book about the internal family systems method of therapy and its so encouraging the idea is basically that our even our bad and self destructive parts are just pieces of self doing the best they can for us because however misguided their efforts may be they are just trying to protect a wounded part of self,YourFriendMaryGrace
i used to feel bad about how frustrated and panicked id get when my husband was telling me about something complex i knew cognitively that he was just trying to share some interesting thing he learned but i couldnt stop the amygdala reactions eventually i realized that i was reacting this way because of my experiences as an adhd child and teen not being able to pay attention and feeling the intense embarrassment of not getting it like the other kids so my feelings of anger and fear about these conversations werent bad they were just screaming get out to try and protect me from feeling embarrassed again realizing that has helped me stop guilting myself for the feelings and instead i think to myself thank you frustration and anxiety for trying to keep me from reliving embarrassing situations but im okay im safe it only feels unsafe,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats just one example of many i could share as i am something of a walking ball of triggers lol its been hugely helpful for me in my healing,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit ive also realized that by soothing these dark reactions im able to stay in the moment and let my wounded selves experience safety now when my husband wants to tell me something complex i find that i can listen and learn just fine which is healing in itself,YourFriendMaryGrace
im sorry you experienced that dream it sounds pretty terrifying im of the belief that dreams can come in many different forms precognitive intuitive and metaphorical to name a few and sometimes as appears to be the case here theyre a combination of metaphors based on past and future events the kind i work with are the metaphorical which can tell us about whats going on in your head that you may not be consciously processing the most important thing to know is that these are my impressions of the dream and since i dont have the brain that dreamt this i cant tell you for sure what it means for you the best way to receive a dream interpretation is to ponder it disregard anything that didnt resonate and think about how the imagery and emotions correlate to your real life,YourFriendMaryGrace
missiles are a direct and targeted attack you may want to consider ifhow you might have been feeling attacked or afraid of being attacked at the time you had this dream it could also be a dream about an attack from years ago which your subconscious is still trying to make sense of,YourFriendMaryGrace
our friends often show up in a dream as standins for ourselves specifically the part of oneself that is reflected in the personality of the friend for example my friend g often shows up in my dreams and through context and introspection i realized that i dream of him as a standin for the part of myself that gets distant and aloof from insecurity which is one of the traits i noticed early on in g,YourFriendMaryGrace
you have a few old friends with you and its quite possible that they all represent a part of yourself its also possible that your subconscious placed them there because the dream is reflecting an attack that occurred during the time of your life that was spent with these friends it could be both the one that dies i suspect is a part of yourself that youve lost as a result of some unexpected trauma or difficulty ie missile in your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
having to tell his family seems like a significant plot point but its hard to say what it means a few possibilities when some part of your persona dies friends and family are typically the first to notice that something is off maybe this part of the dream reflects having to interact with your family without this lost part of yourself another possibility the family could be other parts of yourself that you have to interact with differently now,YourFriendMaryGrace
with regards to feeling stuck my guess would be that you are ready to reintegrate this lost piece of self back into the whole but theres still some inner work to be done it could be as simple as identifying the part of yourself thats missing and intending for it to redevelop,YourFriendMaryGrace
if any of that resonates awesome but if not thats completely okay dont try to make it fit dreams are individual creations and you are the best interpreter of your own,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit oops i left out an important possible explanation toconsider for the friend in your dream which is that of course he may be playing the part of himself its especially likely if you went through hard times with this friend or have lost contact with him,YourFriendMaryGrace
a good way to test this is to observe the very first thoughts and emotions you have when you think about this friend if you feel something unpleasant such as guilt sadness etc thats an emotional response that your subconscious would probably like to resolve which it often does in the form of nightmares about how you ended up feeling this way about your friend if you feel loving and neutral when you think about the friend then he probably represents a part of yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you have any recent dreams you dont mind sharing id be happy to let you know what i see,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont disagree with you on the deceptive intentions but i still pay attention to the dates and claims because i have a hunch they are often used to distract from the real beauty of the day many people predicted feb 20th as a possible date for the event while others were predicting global chaos i had quite a huge personal breakthrough in meditation on feb 20th and yesterday i had some smaller but powerful realizations so i just think its possible that these dates are important energetically and the thing thats fake about them is what were told will happen i dont think they draw random dates out of a hat i think they try to create fear on dates when we might otherwise be especially likely to raise our vibrations,YourFriendMaryGrace
i went from 53 to 55 by improving my posture using a foam roller on my back and retraining my back muscles to strengthen and lengthen im not sure if i manifested it or if i just had two inches worth of height hiding under a slouchweak middle back either way its pretty cool,YourFriendMaryGrace
sure they do people all over the world have grueling schedules and need to play sometimes no argument there,YourFriendMaryGrace
the question of why those specific words were displayed on their signs remains,YourFriendMaryGrace
yeah this isnt the exact article i read but its a bit better because it summarizes the results of many experiments such as the one i mentioned above mediation and violent crime,YourFriendMaryGrace
i read an article recently about transcendental meditation it said that when 1 of the towns population practiced meditation the crime rate went down by 16  pretty incredible,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is a good one im super intrigued by the possible implications of quantum entanglement and this could be a great example the idea being that your initial interaction and ongoing inside joke about them kept you all entangled enough to subconsciously decide to return at the same time,YourFriendMaryGrace
haha yep i had my first lucid dreaming experience recently and it was in one of the many alternate universes i visit in my sleep i was walking down the stairs in my old sorority house and noticed that the walls were painted beige this struck me as odd because i know theyve been painted gray since i graduated my next thought was this must be a dream i can fly,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think there must be a suspension of disbelief switch that the subconscious can flip otherwise it makes no sense whatsoever that of all the crazy things ive dreamt some walls being painted beige instead of gray would be the thing that made me go waaaait just a minute now  this cant be my daytoday reality,YourFriendMaryGrace
she looks like a kind and lovely woman im so glad you found this photo and though its been a long time id still like to say that im sorry for your loss,YourFriendMaryGrace
hell yeah your are really showing him whose boss,YourFriendMaryGrace
did you feel like you were gonna go crazy i dont know what my mind would do with a week of isolation,YourFriendMaryGrace
i relate to your post very much my first awakening came with the meaning of life is love hitting me like a ton of bricks and ive also gotten to experience the feeling of that ultimate love and acceptance surrounding me its hard to put into words what it feels like but if it were a drug id be hooked i think youre right about keeping an open mind i feel a bit sad for people who dont want to ask questions and explore the possibilities the universe is so mysterious and beautiful,YourFriendMaryGrace
try keeping a dream journal you can use your phone or an actual notebook by your bed just jot down the key points of whatever dreams you had as soon as you wake up you might be surprised to see some patterns emerge and it can even help you figure out things that are bothering you subconsciously ive learned that keeping a dream journal can sort of prompt the subconscious mind to dream more effectively and helpfully and it should help you distinguish between dreamland and real life too,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know that it provides proof of anything new but it seems like pretty good evidence of the existence of a collective unconscious,YourFriendMaryGrace
ha my badi got my fancy schools mixed up,YourFriendMaryGrace
i was feeling like today was special some kind of collaborative energy in the air so i checked the gcp dot and it looks like the coherence of the number generators is off the charts very interesting and i was wondering if anyone has seen it like this before,YourFriendMaryGrace
for those who have no idea what im talking about lol heres the stanford university webpage  with information on how the data is collected,YourFriendMaryGrace
its so weird i can see your first response in my notifications but i cant click on it or read the whole thing anyway yes it is a wand the lovely man i bought it from does the woodworking part and his partner who chooses the crystals and stones was not in the store at the time he thought it might be serpentine its pretty smooth isnt cool to the touch,YourFriendMaryGrace
yours might be a true statement though you can find out for yourself that uimreallyokay is sharing the truth all you have to do is experiment no purchase necessary,YourFriendMaryGrace
dude you arent kidding its been mindblowing to me im getting chills just typing this lol its like the biggest obstacle is just realizing what the universe is really like once you accept that its operating according to your expectations you can change your life,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know what it is i first started noticing how real these things are in early 2013 and it seems that a lot of people started noticing around the same time then there was another big influx of people having these experiences in december and again in february of this year maybe theres periodic shifts in energies or frequencies or something that supercharges the effects of the thoughts we have whatever it it seems to be getting stronger and more frequent,YourFriendMaryGrace
is this aventurine  thanks for sharing your gifts here,YourFriendMaryGrace
coincidence just means that two related events happened for no apparent reason it doesnt mean that there is no reason my theory is that the veil over reality started lifting a few years ago and picked up the pace around december 2017 it seems like synchronicities precognition manifestations and other thoughtpowered occurrences are off the charts these days,YourFriendMaryGrace
my advice is to stay in a loving and grateful mindset as much as possible it supercharges these abilities and we all have these abilities btw to a degree that still surprises me even after years of practice,YourFriendMaryGrace
maybe if i start thinking about money itll appear in my life,YourFriendMaryGrace
it will but the key is in how you think about money if youre thinking i dont have enough money youll manifest a continuous lack of money thinking i have an abundance of moneyim thankful for an abundance of money has worked much better for me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have experienced that with personal changes my theory is that its something to do with collapsing timelines you can remember the facts of a collapsed timeline for a while but it eventually fades away as you progress through the remaining timelines,YourFriendMaryGrace
yes my skin feels tight and itchy even on my back which was fully clothed all day other than that i feel great i went to bed early feeling out of sorts and irritable woke up at 333am feeling overcome with love for my husband and little ones and the rest of the world too ive been awake ever since feeling perfectly rested,YourFriendMaryGrace
we already have the gifts weve just collectively forgotten about themno longer teach them you are capable telepathy remote viewing lucid dreaming and manifestation with or without the event some are foreseeing,YourFriendMaryGrace
sign me up please i would be happy to help moderate as well,YourFriendMaryGrace
im a philip k dick fan and find this interesting as he had a friend named valis who assisted him in getting his life together but his valis was a pink light and had a female voice,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think youll find this interesting then friendly hallucinations are only rare in some places from this article,YourFriendMaryGrace
stanford anthropologist tanya luhrmann found that voicehearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture  in the united states the voices are harsh and threatening in africa and india they are more benign and playful this may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia she suggests,YourFriendMaryGrace
i find that when peoples negative energies limiting beliefs etc bring me down its because theyre mirroring something within myself like if im not experiencing any anger i can observe anger from within a bubble and just feel kind of amused and eager to help sometimes it even seems to supercharge my positive state but if im experiencing even mild pessimism for example the pessimism of others brings me wayyyyy down,YourFriendMaryGrace
just my thoughts friend to friend,YourFriendMaryGrace
i had a nightmare of an attack on the country maybe the world it was coming from the sky via helicopters and such and i was taking shelter with others i havent had a nightmare in ages and war isnt something that typically worries me so this seemed to come from nowhere,YourFriendMaryGrace
aww my daughter is three and doesnt understand that i actually order and pay for the groceries that get delivered i havent explained it to her because its funny and cute seeing her flip out with gratitude over everything she just goes to the door and immediately starts thanking the delivery person for random items,YourFriendMaryGrace
a few of my friends and family have had similar experiences like watching a movie or craving a certain food and then learning they watchedate the exact same thing on the same date a few years back my theory is that the subconscious mind keeps track of a lot more than we can consciously remember so basically you listened to the song and recalled that memory because you subconsciously remembered it was the anniversary of your friends post again just a theory but it makes sense to me,YourFriendMaryGrace
this article   is pretty long so ive copied the relevant parts,YourFriendMaryGrace
all of these were minor interventions compared to its apogee the saving of phils sons life phil describes how one morning he was lying in a semisleep state when he heard the voice announce that his recently born son christopher had a potentially fatal birth defect and that urgent medical attention was needed indeed the voice was quite precise when it stated,YourFriendMaryGrace
your son has an undiagnosed right inguinal hernia the hydrocele has burst and it has descended into the scrotal sac he requires immediate attention or will soon die,YourFriendMaryGrace
tessa acting on her husbands frantic instructions took christopher to the family doctor and it was indeed confirmed that christopher had exactly the problem the voice had described and surgery was needed,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is cool philip k dick saw a pink light that he credited with saving his little boys life,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey buddy thanks so much,YourFriendMaryGrace
woah i love these beautiful coincidences of the universe,YourFriendMaryGrace
ive always found it really cool and interesting that albert einstein was born on pi day and now its the day stephen hawking died as well its also my birthday but i have made no significant contributions to math and science,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey neighbor i believe in you,YourFriendMaryGrace
im really sorry for your loss,YourFriendMaryGrace
i havent seen game of thrones or avatar but the header image really gives me the creeps for some reason,YourFriendMaryGrace
i think its something to do with the frequency or energy of our thoughts but im not sure the exciting thing is that these phenomenon and things of a similar nature are being observed and studied in mainstream science now whereas in the recent past its been relegated to the mystical realm im of the opinion that our brains are naturally wired to do all kinds of cool things were mostly unaware of,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry youve been going through some hard times please dont hesitate to pm me anytime you want to talk i know how sometimes it can be easier to open up to a random stranger than a loved one and im here for ya anytime and the same goes for anyone else who happens to read this,YourFriendMaryGrace
i relate to your post ive had two life changing experiences the first coming from a place of despair crying out for a reason to live and suddenly knowing that love is the answer to life the second was like yours in that i saw the source it was pure love and i recognized that i was a part of it and so was everything else,YourFriendMaryGrace
so for me these are the things i know im open to a lot of ideas and i enjoy the search for the truth but im not in any hurry to believe much else  i figure that if something is true it will eventually hit me like a ton of bricks the way those other realizations did,YourFriendMaryGrace
another floor sleeper here hmm i wonder if this is a common tendency for people like us,YourFriendMaryGrace
my sleep last night was normal but saturday night was bananas i went to bed like normal but i seemed to linger in a meditative state for hours i kept experiencing lucid moments of processing things id just been shown by my subconscious i guess like id be semiasleep and fall into a negative thought pattern of thinking defensively then whatever was talking to me would draw my attention to the way it was pulling me into a lower vibe and exactly where on my body it was creating tension i realized that i fall into these defensive thinking patterns all the time for no real reason,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats just a sample of the things i realized that night its never happened to me before but it was very helpful even if i was tired yesterday has anyone else experienced this,YourFriendMaryGrace
good to see you again yes exactly i had this experience on an airplane recently i was walking down the aisle holding my baby boy and i locked eyes with a guy who i instantly recognized though im sure ive never met him in this life it was bizarre we couldnt stop staring at each other then the man in front of him hit his head on the overhead compartment i winced my buddy laughed and i walked on by to find my seat,YourFriendMaryGrace
i did a past life regression recently in which i saw myself as a little girl running around and playing chase with my soulmate who is my husband in this life and then he was just gone i guess he moved away i dont know but i never saw him after we were about seven years old i went on to live a very sad life i sought casual sex and trying to look like jayne mansfield to feel good about myself and married an older man for financial security i was miserable and never came close to any kind of spiritual awakening,YourFriendMaryGrace
then i died and i was a little ball of light hovering around my body for a time until i finally realized i was free and i took off zipping all over the world seeing sights like the eiffel tower then i saw myself in front of the source and i was playing chase with another little ball of light that i knew was my husband in this life we were so happy to be reunited,YourFriendMaryGrace
its sad that i was alone in that life but i see how many lessons i learned that prepared me to meet him and be with him in this life i was born with the innate sense that being able to marry my soulmate would bring me more happiness than i could ever have by living in a big house or having designer clothes even though i wasnt exactly taught that,YourFriendMaryGrace
when i met my husband i was drawn to him immediately the first night we ever spent together was the night of hurricane katrina and he had called to make sure i was okay i was alone and worried about my family who were right in the path of the storm so he invited me over we fell asleep on his living room floor just staring into each others eyes i didnt believe in past lives at the time but the feeling that wed known each other for a long time was overpowering,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont know why i felt compelled to write you all that but there it is lol,YourFriendMaryGrace
my grandparents had this exact one printed and framed in their house when i was a kid thanks for the warm fuzzy throwback feels,YourFriendMaryGrace
that was weird i havent checked the schumann in several days then suddenly felt the urge to check it a few minutes ago i guess my subconscious recognizes the feeling now,YourFriendMaryGrace
dont let your looks stop you if you feel its something youd like to do babies love being snuggled up in big arms,YourFriendMaryGrace
source have had two babies both seem to prefer being held by our guy friends and the bigger the better,YourFriendMaryGrace
agreed of course but i think op took a cab  it would be interesting to know if it seemed like a normal trip to the driver,YourFriendMaryGrace
try to be detailed as possible and include any emotions you felt to get a good interpretation the subconscious is strange in that it will put important parts of the dream in what seem like unimportant details,YourFriendMaryGrace
if you want to go into detail about one of the ones that was really vivid and memorable let me know and im happy to help you figure it out,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit btw i dont need to know private details like names or anything just any other things you can remember,YourFriendMaryGrace
awesome its so very helpful for unlocking your emotional conflicts the subconscious mind is  so interactive its incredible sometimes ill help someone with their dream symbols and the following night my dream will borrow a symbol from their dream to illustrate how i feel about something in my own life and once you begin to consciously process your dreams its like the subconscious starts working overtime to help you grow its so creative too this morning i woke up with a little poem running through my mind on repeat,YourFriendMaryGrace
you shall know thyself and thine inner self this is my gift to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
you shall know thyself and thine inner self and then know others too,YourFriendMaryGrace
you got it and for anyone else interested pm me anytime and rest assured that i dont judge,YourFriendMaryGrace
i enjoy helping people interpret their dreams if you feel like sharing,YourFriendMaryGrace
do you feel like youve been forced into something lately or like someone is trying to make be you more like them rape dreams are often about feeling a loss of control it may or may not be about your dad but its almost definitely not about sex,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry this happened to you,YourFriendMaryGrace
obviously quick question though why dont you just give them the message yourself,YourFriendMaryGrace
where is this whole forced reincarnation belief coming from im open to the idea of reincarnation but this particular flavor just tastes really off to me like a disinformation campaign or something anyway it goes against the entire nature of higher beings to force anyone to do anything i have some experiences and have read the experiences of countless other people and theres no reason to be afraid the event isnt postponed its ongoing and has been for several years its the thinning of the veil that has kept us from being able to see the true and beautiful nature of our universe and ourselves which is why so many people have been experiencing glitches and the overwhelming feeling like something bigger is going on,YourFriendMaryGrace
again theres no reason to be afraid and discord headquarters should consider integrating meditation practice into their lives,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is awesome youve brought up some things ive thought about as well as some things ive never considered im not a lucid dreamer so what got me thinking about this possibility was when my dreams suddenly started to fall into two very distinct categories the first is what i call metaphorical dreams and theyre not linear or anything close to real life the settings and circumstances are wildly different every night and they make no sense as a storyline theyre super useful though because they help me unpack the emotional conflicts i have,YourFriendMaryGrace
but the second category started happening just a few years ago and theyre completely different ive only seen three realities but i have been to them countless times at this point to where now i know what universe im in as soon as i arrive im still married to my husband in all of them but we have no children irl we have two which i dont think we would want to have children in these realities because theyre dangerous and shitty places its like the same universe as this one and our personalities are the same but everything feels much more hopeless and frightening almost postapocalyptic like one time my husband was almost killed for his crappy bike and it felt scary but also like it happened all the time,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats just about the only significant event thats happened though because most of the time were just walking to the car or sitting in the house or talking to friends its like things are so bad that no one has jobs or anything to look forward to and thats the other thing that makes it hard to believe these are just dreams my metaphorical dreams are like alice in wonderland levels of nonsense but these are just so real i experience them in real time and the way wethey feel is so vivid and raw and depressing that its a huge relief to wake up back in this universe,YourFriendMaryGrace
i like where youre going with the idea of what our experience of being overtaken might feel like i hadnt thought of that i wonder if it might explain why we feel deja vu as well like maybe we already experienced the moment vicariously in another reality but it wasnt vivid enough to remember when we woke up,YourFriendMaryGrace
this theory might also explain deja rvprecognitive dreams like maybe when a universe is very similar to ours random events that happen ahead of time in one show up in the dreams of another one thing thats often noted on rprecognition is that theres usually a detail or two in the dream thats off and if these are closely related alternate universes it makes sense that some of the specifics would be different when i was little i vividly dreamed that both my pet rabbits were attacked and killed by dogs which had never even occurred to me as a possibility before about a week later they were attacked by dogs but only one of them died its one of my earliest memories of knowing the universe is more than it seems,YourFriendMaryGrace
thanks for the response i love this stuff cant wait to hear more of your thoughts,YourFriendMaryGrace
i got chills reading your post you really get it and yes i think we share many overlaps in experience and tendencies the way you describe the justification for our mental revenge is so apt haha its an ongoing process for me ive made it a long way but i still search my heart sometimes and find various people who i havent yet come to believe are worthy of full understanding forgiveness in meditation a few weeks ago i realized that there were 4 people i was still holding a bitter grudge against because they hurt my older brother all the way back when i was in high school i hadnt consciously thought of them often but it was a feeling of newly deepened physical relaxation as i forgave them one by one,YourFriendMaryGrace
which reminds me of the other thing that i wanted to ask you about have you looked into the physical side of trauma at all im still learning but its fascinating how trauma is stored not just in memory but in the nervous system and body as well i thought of it because you mentioned trauma of course but also psychedelics mdma therapy is doing miracles for people with trauma of all kinds just something to consider its not going to be legally available until hopefully 2020 but some therapists will do it off the record or you could even possibly be a part of the trials or just read the method and take a diy approach im just throwing out ideas i have also read of people physically releasing trauma through acupuncture sensory derivation chambers somatic therapy and of course meditation,YourFriendMaryGrace
im so sorry its been a really rough 15 years and i hope you are at the precipice of a whole new world of beautiful experiences im thankful for your kind words and inspired by your spirit,YourFriendMaryGrace
i hope im not out of line but i was also born into privilege and i relate to much of what youve shared about 5 years ago i rejected the life of pursuing wealth and image and i gave away my belongings and moved to the desert everyone thought id lost my mind and were checking in on me with great concern but its probably the most sane thing ive ever done and i just wanted to tell you what i wish id done differently,YourFriendMaryGrace
i wish id known the power of forgiveness love and unconditional acceptance i went through an awakening that led to this desert adventure so cognitively i knew these things were of utmost importance but i was still in a very bitter and judgmental mindset with regards to my parents my upbringing anyone who had a healthy savings account and all the powerful people of the world who dont care about the powerless in my mind i was doing something very wise and awakened and they were all so very wrong and lost,YourFriendMaryGrace
it held me back i was meditating and learning but i was also stuck replaying the mental tapes from my childhood pinpointing the endless ways that i was wronged thinking of all the things that other people needed to understand imagining myself telling them and i never found the bottom of the barrel of reasons to rehash it all it was a giant toxic waste of time and energy i thought i was figuring stuff out and understanding things that needed to be understood but in hindsight none of the revelations were even useful whats been useful is realizing that people hurt others because they themselves are hurting and that the trauma i received will not go away because of time spent dwelling on the past mistakes of others but rather forgiving them and believing that im not better than them its counterintuitive but believing that im no better than anyone else has been enormously beneficial in learning to love myself,YourFriendMaryGrace
im now a firm believer that everyones path is different and perfect for them so my evaluation of where another person should be in their own path is effectively meaningless its helped me stop looking at my parents and everyone else and seeing people who dont get it or people who fucked up and instead simply see them as souls having an experience just like me and thats opened the door for a whole world of spiritual growth that i couldnt imagine before i actually wrote a post   about one of my meditation experiences that you may find resonates,YourFriendMaryGrace
im totally rambling and none of the above may even be useful to you so more than anything just know that youre not alone and im here for you anytime,YourFriendMaryGrace
this is called deja vu its a very strange feeling,YourFriendMaryGrace
what made you remember it as ww3 specifically like they were calling it that on the news as soon as it started,YourFriendMaryGrace
i have died in a dream before too theres all kinds of things people say supposedly cant happen in a dream like die read use a computer etc etc i think its a little silly because anything can happen in dreamland its probably more accurate to say that certain things rarely happen in a dream,YourFriendMaryGrace
anyway i tend to look at dreams metaphorically and imagine what real life experiences and emotions might be symbolized in yours i was thinking about your friend as a lost part of yourself maybe something youve suppressed as you try and play the game of life social pressure etc the house thats out of place and didnt belong in the park made you want to run out of there maybe thats symbolic of the same idea in that you lost part of yourself for fear of not fitting in and dying that seems to me like you cant truly live without this part of yourself im just telling you my impressions though i think its very very important to take interpretations with a grain of salt because you have the mind that dreamt it so your own feelings about what it means are most important,YourFriendMaryGrace
an interesting detail of your dream is that you fell to the west looking north the four directions carry an energy and meaning that incredibly is found in disparate cultures and beliefs all over the world and across time the west often symbolizes a journey to grow and fulfill a purpose think of the tribal cultures where a young man reaches a certain age and is sent on a solo journey to become a man the west is kind of like that symbolically speaking its not a journey for someone who knows nothing its a journey to grow and put to use all the things you have already learned,YourFriendMaryGrace
the north is often used to represent death wisdom old age and completion so its very cool and interesting to me that in your dying moments of the dream you were facing north the beautiful thing about dying symbolically speaking is that you will be reborn into a better version of yourself so to tie all this together it would be a pretty exciting message about the next phase of life that your subconscious has planned for you,YourFriendMaryGrace
id love to read more of this series of dreams and if you do feel like sharing remember that sometimes the best and most potent messages from a dream are in the details that seem unimportant at the time im also very open to the idea of dreams as portals alternate dimensions you name it so do share your theory if and when you feel like it,YourFriendMaryGrace
it seems like a dream about the competitive nature of our society,YourFriendMaryGrace
check out the sub rprecognition and youll find youre not alone its called deja rv,YourFriendMaryGrace
hey im not the person you were asking but i can tell you my experience it seems to me like synchronicities especially when they have a theme are like little messages from the universe theres something about jesus or religion that you are supposed to do or understand and it will help you once you get the message your syncs will probably switch to a different theme,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit just a thought i dont want to influence your perception of the message so this is just something that was true for me personally but a huge part of my spiritual awakening came with the realization that jesus words love your neighbor as yourself  would completely change the world if everyone did it im not a christian or a follower of a particular religion but that one night of realizing the profundity of that message opened my eyes to a whole world of spiritual growth i just mention it as an example of the message being a doorway rather than the end of the messages,YourFriendMaryGrace
water bottles and cats seem to be tied for the glitchiest things in the universe,YourFriendMaryGrace
had either of you seen or thought of something that was oh no material sometimes my husband hears me calling for him when i havent said anything and its usually when i was just thinking about asking him something so ive wondered if the energy or intention or frequency of our thoughts sometimes manifest in a way that another person might perceive as audible,YourFriendMaryGrace
i cant advise you in terms of medication but what youre describing is no way to live your greatest mission is to love and be loved and whether its real or not anything infiltrating your thoughts and frightening this you this way does not have your best interests at heart,YourFriendMaryGrace
my husband and i have noticed the facequirks and mannerisms thing too we even have categories of peoples faces that we reference nowm ndndndd rifle  and jekekekk djejejjjrj  and  are  doing it nxnsnd f ppl khamenei vbb van rd heuejr yuri  xi w uf and on oki dorr,YourFriendMaryGrace
sorry my 3 year old borrowed my phone and wanted to contribute to the discussion and i didnt have the heart to delete anyway ive been thinking about physics lately and how it might explain some things that we see on this sub like how when particles collide they influence and affect each other for life regardless of how far apart they end up if this applies on a human being scale it might explain things like friends and partners reading each others minds or randomly messaging each other at the same time especially in the case of separated twins since it doesnt get much more particle collisiony than sharing a womb,YourFriendMaryGrace
some men would but not all of them there are men who feel the same way due to personal or religious reasons,YourFriendMaryGrace
deja vu is when you suddenly feel like whats happening in that moment has happened to you before but sometimes the feeling occurs when you are doing something youve never done its hard to explain but i think most people have experienced it at least once ive never had deja rv but i get deja vu,YourFriendMaryGrace
thats awesome you have a gift check out rluciddreaming they have all kinds of tips for taking control of your dreams,YourFriendMaryGrace
im very sorry that happened to you your theory is fascinating to me as ive been studying the way trauma is stored in the nervous system and ive never seen this particular symptom suggested in 2020 we may have mdma therapeutically available and i think its going to be amazing how many lifelong conditions subside as people are able to process and release the awful things that have happened to them i have a friend who did it and hes a palpably happier and healthier person now anyway thanks for sharing and i really wish you all the best,YourFriendMaryGrace
i dont think theres going to be a big event i think its more likely to be many many events that unfold over time and are already unfolding and many of them may only be perceptible to some so one persons great day may be another persons crappy day and the next time theyll have the opposite experience so while im not a believer in terms of the event i love reading the messages and feelings people are getting because to me they hold weight even if the day comes and goes without any big headlines or energy shifts that effect me,YourFriendMaryGrace
i feel bad for you op because this is not exactly a winwin situation but if i may be so bold as to make a suggestion id say let the group think it over and see what we come up with rather than declare a blanket ban i greatly appreciate this sub and your desire to keep it peaceful and i think we can manage that without silencing the people who have a message to share,YourFriendMaryGrace
lastly thanks for all the work you do here,YourFriendMaryGrace
edit one more thought that just came to me perhaps a slight change in the expectations we have is a key here when i think about it headline news is almost always based in things that evoke fear uncertainty and other lowvibe feels for all we know yesterday there was a 5000 increase in the number of random good deeds done by strangers the effects of which will positively impact us for generations,YourFriendMaryGrace
but if we keep getting our hopes up about some newsworthy event well be perpetually disappointed in what otherwise might be some magical days i guess my point is that the key might be not to silence the predictions but to look at the projected dates as days where we might experience newsworthy spiritual upgrades,YourFriendMaryGrace
yesterday i was  bursting with energy and because of the predictions for the eye passing through space and over our earth for the next few days i decided it was a good day to go deeper than usual in my meditating so i did a meditation track meant to help you meet your higher self and mine looked like a fox it helped me untangle an internal conflict about my hearts desires that has been heavy on my mind for nearly 5 years which for me was a huge event if it hadnt been for those predictions i might have chalked up my energy boost to too much caffeine and not even tried to meditate so im thankful and they werent wrong in my book,YourFriendMaryGrace
its called deja rv and its surprisingly common check out rprecognition,YourFriendMaryGrace
