someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can know youre safe now,MLeek
id say that id have to,MLeek
it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way,MLeek
do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse,MLeek
if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner,MLeek
but to be entirely honest as a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex,MLeek
youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice,MLeek
consigned,MLeek
as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals,MLeek
a personal choice is fine and all  i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time  and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in,MLeek
no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this way with any reliability,MLeek
two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women,MLeek
young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours,MLeek
but human beings arent wolves either,MLeek
okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him,MLeek
tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect,MLeek
stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him so you choose that any sane person would,MLeek
dont tell him exactly how to fix it remind him youve given him plenty of suggestions and you now expect him to fix this problem not continue to make it yours,MLeek
if that direct talk about consequences and boundaries does not get get him moving on this within a few days start planning to be rid of him if the problem is him and hes choosing to keep those problems and make them yours too then you have to solve your real problem by getting rid of him,MLeek
hes told you he doesnt want help hes shown you his plan you can disagree but if he had a plan and hes working it you need to stop pressuring him to make a better one its his plan,MLeek
and he may be right about what the limits of the charitycouncil powers are and its not your business in the least if he doesnt want to ask his parents for help,MLeek
if hes paying his obligations to the shared home then you need to let him carry his personal burden the way he chooses too and speak for yourself speaking for yourself can look like i dont have the bandwidth the listen to these complaintsstress right now or even i find it hurtful you continue to complain at me but will not entertain any of the suggestions ive given you at all speak for your own feelings stop trying to fix the situation for him its his,MLeek
if hes not paying his agreed on share of your shared home then you need to consider that this isnt a safe person for you to live with because he expects you to carry his burdens without having to listen to you or consider your feelings or perspectives at all,MLeek
this it makes me so mad when kids are taught this was the highest of high art and was inaccessible or highbrow rj literally opens with a bunch of teenage buddies making a rape joke a rape pun but so many teachers just swan on past that,MLeek
i was confused at first too then i remembered women are always bad and always to blame,MLeek
youre probably incompatible this isnt what you want,MLeek
you can and should bring up the idea of separate bedrooms but its concerning that he doesnt seem to recognize that option,MLeek
dude the part that made this really bad sex was the part where you made it her job to take care of your feelings afterwards no hook up wants to be your therapist or your coach,MLeek
the fact you are continuing to think it would appreciate to try and demand more of her time and attention is unhinged,MLeek
go watch some educational videos on performing oral sex and with the next woman ask her what she likes and make sure she orgasms before your penis gets involved,MLeek
leave this woman alone as she has clearly told you too,MLeek
you are not owed any amount of chances she is owed the basic respect of you not contacting her anymore,MLeek
dont be a creepy demanding child if you showed up at my house in this situation id call the cops and let them explain to you that i will not be speaking with your further,MLeek
nothing but me man me use big tool go vroom,MLeek
statistically women are safer drivers by every metric on a average women are just as capable as men of spacial reasoning but they dont overrate their skills by as much take fewer risks and can more accurately assess the risks women ding cars and crack fenders men kill people,MLeek
from a pure probability pov if you want to live let a woman drive,MLeek
if you dont want to be in an open relationship its time to leave this one because that is the best case scenario the best case scenario is that he wants a transparent and ethical open relationship from there it only get worse,MLeek
dont get stressed out just admit you want monogamy just monogamy nothing else if he doesnt agree fully and directly in language you can rely on let it be over,MLeek
your bf just put you in the be my pretty lady not a human being box,MLeek
it would be slightly different if he had simply said hed prefer you not fart around him when it was avoidable  and because we are human he knows it is not perfectly avoidable  as just a personal preference the fact he connected it to being ladylike is gross and demeaning and very very stupid,MLeek
its funny they think rich men werent hoarding women before,MLeek
you know its just that less of you plebeians die young right most of you were not gonna be landed gentry you were not going to be assigned a buxom teenager you were not likely to be master or meritorious in 1020 or 1620 or 1820 either,MLeek
youre just angry you dont have a woman an assigned woman you can punch down at no matter how low you are,MLeek
i always wonder if they think small children in guatemala are just failing to manifest food and clean drinking water like if systemic issues dont exist then there are entire nations causing famine with all their negative self talk,MLeek
fit of rage is a phrase which should only ever be associated with an ex,MLeek
you dont have to be perfect to deserve not to be absurd that is a lie abusers love to tell to keep you trapped,MLeek
thank you for explaining why this might be a deterrent it seemed like a very easy hoop to jump through to me for someone with malicious intent who wanted to create a false sense of security,MLeek
i am opposed to engaging with people who exhibit a behaviour i have found to be directly connected with negatively resentment and even other controlling behaviours,MLeek
also i am woman who largely but not exclusively dates men,MLeek
in my experience men who start off with this demand quickly have other demands and accusations,MLeek
i have strategies to keep myself safe this is not one of them,MLeek
exactly the opposite i guess my strategy is too avoid men who exhibit a behaviour that doesnt make me feel safe and respected,MLeek
your husband turned you into his private porn star without telling you about it he felt entitled to doing so without your formal consent and is now demanding a formal request they be deleted,MLeek
i doubt your husband is a compete fucking moron he was aware or should have reasonably assumed that you believed the videos were deleted and that is what you wanted he should not have felt entitled to them in this way and trying to make you the bad guy who demands he give up something he never should have taken without explicit permission is revolting,MLeek
you are underreacting,MLeek
it feels like an invasion because it was,MLeek
tell him to delete them,MLeek
tell him he fucked up royally by behaving entitled to these videos without a transparent conversation at very least you should express deep disappointment with his judgment,MLeek
hes 32,MLeek
hes not confused about pets he doesnt need it explained to him this is who he wants to be the asshole who treats your dog poorly and enjoys its fear,MLeek
he sees you only as a servant to his future baby not as a person balancing her loves and needs,MLeek
and people who are jealous of pet are often jealous of babies as well,MLeek
dont keep such an open mind your brain falls right out this is exactly what it looks like,MLeek
if trust is broken dont date her,MLeek
testing her is just demeaning yourself in a shitty relationship that already isnt working,MLeek
you were manipulative you were toxic you decided to stay in a relationship you shouldnt have and used that as excuse to practice being a bad person,MLeek
i dont understand how this strategy is protecting someone from a trafficker the trafficker is usually real local people arent they it doesnt seem like it would have helped the victim in that article,MLeek
youre mistaking consequences for cant do it,MLeek
you absolutely can break a contract and if it was a legal one there might be consequences for doing so,MLeek
but scientology cannot enforce their a billionyear contract in court and you cannot use the law to force your partner back into the marital home or bed if they dont want to be there,MLeek
yeah im fine with that youd be unmatched not an issue for me what reason a person concocts at that point,MLeek
yeah ask for a facetime first and okay but ask me to buy todays newspaper or make some weird hand signs often within the first day of matching just gtfo,MLeek
i used to do it without fail these people were all bitter resentful and a bit controlling,MLeek
he knows how you feel he doesnt care he feels entitled to placing this pressure on you he thinks you should preform this way for him,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
and hes a bully,MLeek
dont stay with him,MLeek
but since youre going to anyways say this comments about my femininity skirts and makeup need to stop youve cross the line from expressing a preference to being really hurtful if you care about not hurting me you will stop if you care more about what i wear then how i feel we will break up maybe not tomorrow maybe not right away but itll happen if you dont stop hurting me,MLeek
this it has to be really extreme before i assume they were actively trying to be deceptive im bad at reading photos,MLeek
im far more annoyed by men who lie outrageously about their height ive happily dated men who are shorter than me and secure about it dont want to date a person who isnt comfortable in the height difference,MLeek
i dont know if youre joking but when someone does this to me i immediately unmatch my photos are current and authentic and i use to comply but i have never had a positive interaction when i did,MLeek
a person who comes at me from this kind of place of bitterness and control is not someone i will continue to speak with,MLeek
dating is risky and often disappointing but if all youre bringing into is distrust and anger i want none of it,MLeek
then be honest with your own needs and walk away,MLeek
i didnt mean to imply he needs to regret or feel ashamed only that people who have enjoyed casual sex in the past are still capable of choosing monogamy and being faithful in my experience they are often better at it because of the lack of fomo,MLeek
youre not compatible,MLeek
he could be just as capable of commitment and monogamy as any man who ever lived but it doesnt matter if you cannot believe that,MLeek
if youve lost trust this is over,MLeek
you should date the person in front of you not their every past choice or the person youd hope they could become you need to be able to believe what they say about their current choices and values if you cannot be happy with that person today be honest and bow out,MLeek
because freedom,MLeek
the republicans are right and royally fucked,MLeek
they have cultivated a delusional base that is not capable of selecting a candidate who can win a general,MLeek
running to trumps right is the smart way to get the nom and then to in loose the popular vote again and probably the election,MLeek
you just know this man watches nothing but hard core anal porn and pimple popping videos and is in deep denial about his desire to be pegged,MLeek
because its not about attraction,MLeek
like rape the power is the point the violation is what they want,MLeek
they are just exerting power in a public place all public spaces belong to men in this persons mind women just walk through them women in mens spaces get what they deserve,MLeek
ive a had few men try to genuinely compliment me you can tell the difference and no its not that they are chads they have said shit like cool hat awesome vibe or wish i was going to whatever party youre headed too,MLeek
its really not that hard to compliment a stranger stand still do not move into their space compliment a choice not a innate thing about their body allow the interaction to end right then easy,MLeek
i disagree with your premise,MLeek
the divorce rate doesnt speak to people who want to end it over the smallest thing most people i know who divorced worked damn hard sincerely to avoid it the people i know whove been married 10 years went through periods where they had to do that work too,MLeek
assuming every divorce is a personal failure is a lingering stigma not a reality,MLeek
and how can we say the divorce rate is high when were comparing it to a time when it was practically financially and often legally impossible to divorce not to mention the stigma do we really think marriages were twice as healthy and happy in 1950 as they were in 1990 or that they were 3x more blissful that people were really freely consenting to stay married more often even if your own family history was happy enough most of us can ask our grandmothers about the women she knew and be quickly disabused of that notion,MLeek
and why in earth do you think people who dont want to marry not marrying is a problem,MLeek
of course he did,MLeek
my ex and his family were appalled that months after he dumped me with a bit of bonus cruelty i did not come to care for him during his unexpected surgery as i had during the first eight of them you see he had thought he was healthy now so he no longer needed me he had blamed me for stalling his life but once he was in need again i was a monster for not actually putting my life on pause again to care for him,MLeek
the mind boggles,MLeek
in other words people who are less likely to want commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives are less likely to work towards commitment and compromise at that stage of their lives,MLeek
and im disagreeing it seems very obvious to me that is not many people that is a minority the majority are inclined to stay longer than they really should and keep working,MLeek
more importantly its the right outcome thats the would i want to live in if someone has one foot out the door give em a shove problem solved,MLeek
hah id say they dont actually understand consent,MLeek
they just glom on to buzzwords to try and make their positions sound modern and palatable its like when they talk about the loneliness epidemic and mens mental health stigma and youre nodding along because yes real issues but then you realize they are actually suggesting the government gift these men sex slaves to solve  the problem,MLeek
i agree the only reasons i can see to get married today is if you believe its a religious sacrament terrifying to me but ok or if being married provides better protection for the children and their rights where you live otherwise dont get it very expensive party and pointless peice of paper for me,MLeek
i cannot comprehend this attitude towards people its so objectively and observably false,MLeek
most people the vast majority keep working at preserving a relationship for months or years after it becomes objectively clear it should probably end and both parties would be happier and healthier we all know these people we have mostly been these people,MLeek
i looked back in my life and know where i should have had a zero tolerance policy lying about money throwing things in anger being mean to waiters,MLeek
healthier conflict resolution skills often contribute to relationships coming to an end because healthy approaches to adversity and conflict include fundamentally changing the terms of the relationship agreement or even ending it,MLeek
i work very hard to look like im ignoring everyone who is hollering for my attention in public i always listen very closely for a few seconds before deciding if im going to engage and usually i will not if youre asking for directions or warning about construction sure if its unclear in those few seconds what youre up too i assume its no good and keep walking,MLeek
thats nice,MLeek
legally speaking if there is going to be marriage there must be divorce without any outside authority judging whether or not the reasons are good enough anything else in unjust to everyone,MLeek
no fault is a term of art for the kind of separation youre talking about  where no one but one or both of the two people in the marriage gets to decide its over the term exists because there was a and time and place recently and currently where they wasis not the case it doesnt mean everyone is a blameless little angel,MLeek
hes certainly expressed the willingness to blame the woman when he rapes her if he sees the opportunity,MLeek
this seems to be connected to new movement in the manosphere against no fault divorce she consented to be mine and she is not entitled to withdraw that consent for any reason which means its not actually consent at all so the law is wrong when it gives her the ability to leave the marriage,MLeek
the problem with the divorce rate in their minds is the same problem as the false accusation rape hysteria they dont want women to be able to withdraw anything they interpreted as consent to their supremacy they want to trap one and not have to worry again about being worthy or of a partnership,MLeek
this guy knows with 100 certainty that no woman has ever enjoyed herself with him and never will,MLeek
motherhood is the best thing when it serves them personally or their political goals,MLeek
the like motherhood as an ideal not as an occupation that might not directly benefit them,MLeek
the fact that an actual person they have to interact with may be doing the work of being a parent while female is inherently distasteful,MLeek
i think it should be a goal daily on a personal level  ignore them live your life,MLeek
but beyond the personal sphere we cannot afford to ignore them not only do the extreme members try to kill us with guns and with legislation but the shepherds are leading more and more young men to the slaughter on a societal and political level they cannot be ignored they want women subjugated and their strategy relies are making more and more men desperate entitled ill or angry enough to support that cause  on the false promise that access to an unhappy subjugated women will make them happy and that they will all of course be found deserving and meritorious by the new patriarchy,MLeek
its a bad habit and she needs to stop,MLeek
could it mean shes not over him sure but a bit more likely is that shes picking at the scab rerunning conversations in her head and basically letting this wound fester,MLeek
she cant build a new healthy relationship unless she recognizes this behaviour is selfdestructive just cause lots of people do it especially just every once in a while and not weekly doesnt mean it okay,MLeek
in the end id be more concerned that its been two years and they havent formalized the divorce,MLeek
you need to go see what you can swing with work,MLeek
look that kind of response is unkind its not crazy for your partner to ask you to commit to spending some vacation time with them or to ask you to confirm those plans in june for july you may not mean to be jerking her around or telling her shes not a priority or embarrassing her in front of her friends but the result of that kind of response can rationally be all those things,MLeek
if you cannot take vacation then figure out when you can and calendarize it now,MLeek
youre working too much regardless of what else is going on here in this relationship your work life balance sounds like complete shit right now and a reasonable partner will become frustrated by that,MLeek
ask him what his plan is for his agreed on portion of the bills are if he is out of working for a month or 3 months or more,MLeek
thats the question you need to ask him and make it clear you have not agreed to covering all the finances for an indeterminate length of time he needs a plan to meet his obligations he needs to communicate that plan to you,MLeek
stop trying to fix the job search issue for him start expecting him to address your very reasonable fears and boundaries like a reasonable person,MLeek
its not your job to find him a job,MLeek
its his his to explain to you how he is going to meet his responsibilities once this contract ends its not totally crazy to be looking forward to job searching after his contact ends but if that is his plan he needs to tell you he has enough cushion to make it happen you are not his safety net you just moved in together that is not a kind or reasonable expectation of you,MLeek
i didnt want a better life for the women,MLeek
just tell him the truth its not working for you,MLeek
this daily texting is awkward and confusing you dont want to continue it you cant build a serious connection like this its hard to even build a friendship tell him you want to stop wish him well,MLeek
block him when he doesnt reply with grace,MLeek
its not fair,MLeek
its obviously abusive behaviour,MLeek
youre not in an ethically nonmonogamous relationships youre in an emotionally abusive one,MLeek
i honestly dont know how women have sex with men in some states these days at all i love sex but it seems unnecessarily risky,MLeek
but at least now you know he wasnt getting better he just has a little while where he had fewer reasons to be utter shit now he has a new  reason to be a selfish abusive peace of shit and hes going all in on it,MLeek
you dont need a perfect excuse but his transparent attempts to bully manipulate and shame you into silencing your own feelings and needs are pretty damn perfect as valid reasons to dump a person goes,MLeek
hes gonna call you selfish and stubborn if you were paying his rent and donating a kidney he just wants to get his way it has nothing to do with reality,MLeek
one of my few boundaries in my open relationship is that neither of us sleep with who is not prochoice even though protection is always used as well,MLeek
i may stay in the relationship with someone else being pregnant but i wouldnt try to force a polycule or triad because she got pregnant the two of them may have a relationship as coparents and that would remain separate from my relationship as partner or friend with either of them,MLeek
but you really shouldnt stay in this relationship,MLeek
he is manipulative and emotionally abusive and if he actually uttered the words small inconvenience to refer to his own child i might take a baseball bat to his bits before i go,MLeek
there is nothing here but to live and learn,MLeek
people are more than just toys or experiences they are people first and foremost dont think because youre less experience its okay to treat someone who isnt openly transparently consenting like a toy or a fun ride its still really important to talk about what you want dont make assumptions about what they want or feel,MLeek
even if you had watched the movie he may still have ended up connecting with and choosing someone else so dont follow that road in your head to silly places,MLeek
its totally normal and healthy to have fantasies but stop fixating on this guy,MLeek
just keep dating,MLeek
use your experience to inform your future choices,MLeek
this is just not a person to engage with the rest is unknowable you can know you were right to get away from her,MLeek
there is nothing to learn here except that you were right eventually good for you,MLeek
but the term youre looking for is serial monogamist or even cowardly little shit sociopath is a stretch based on what youve given here and monkey brancher is from incelpua land with their notoriously terrible understanding of evolutionary psychology if you dont want to be associated with misogyny dont use their buzzwords you can be plenty angry with one shitty person who happens to be a woman without buying into the resentful bullshit that will damage your relationships with all women,MLeek
file this under shitty person is shitty and move on closure happens when you stop caring why shitty is shitty and just be glad to be staying away from it,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
also pair bonding is just a profound misunderstanding misogynists have about birds that they have used as an excuse to shame women if anything human beings can actually get better at forming intimate relationships with more healthy practice at it,MLeek
but that doesnt matter here youre not compatible with her and thats okay you dont trust her dont date someone you dont trust also dont be a controlling twat but that is a seperate issue it just has nothing to do with her cognitive or neurochemical ability to create and maintain partnerships in her own life,MLeek
a yellow flag but not a red one,MLeek
at three months you should be a little bit skeptical of anyones report of their crazyabuse ex,MLeek
but reactive abuse is a very real thing the key word is react people are not at thier best when facing frequent abuse they snap they lash out they do crazy toxic things in reaction to being abused,MLeek
mutual abuse is rare,MLeek
reactive abuse is common and lots of abusers try to push their victims to react so they can blameshift and gaslight the victim into thinking its their fault,MLeek
keep your eyes and ears open but no not an immediate red flag,MLeek
improve first then communicate to him the exact steps you are taking,MLeek
telling him before youve even started the work will feel like youre making an excuse like youre asking him to tolerate it or worse solve it for you and even worse still that might actually be on some level what youre trying to do  get his acceptance and validation make excuses not changes,MLeek
so change first do the soul searching pick some strategies identify a few small steps you need to take and maybe one or two big ones maybe book a session or two with a counsellor then share with him what you are doing to solve your problem,MLeek
no,MLeek
the two things arent related in that way,MLeek
the national pp federation is restructuring to support statelevel decision making better and to developing more telehealth the former ceo was there for 12 years new one has been in place for about 3 i dont think anyone who understands ngo life cycle would find this all that shocking sad for the individuals involved absolutely also totally sane leadership,MLeek
wont lie to you that was all pretty damn bad,MLeek
the point now is to get your head on straight so you dont make similar mistakes when youre hurting or in pain in the future thats the best way to make amends and to rebuild your trust in yourself,MLeek
get back to the hustle and get your financial independence back,MLeek
and dont be so hard on yourself,MLeek
you entered into an arrangement with someone you knew was paying you for sex like a lot of young people you came to realize just what that all meant it would have been rational to assume she was paying others as well looking back you can probably identify some places where you should have said no thank you or suggested she work with another trainer but she was probably far more skilled at pushing past boundaries than you were at expressing them,MLeek
get yourself out safely and rebuild and maybe an sti check crash on a friends couch for a bit if you need too there is nothing wrong with you its a learning experience about setting boundaries listening to your own instincts and avoiding manipulators its one a frightening number of women of all races go through and youll make it through it too,MLeek
i keep on validating disapointment and saddness,MLeek
you keep saying you get it but then immediately insisting on more angry assumptions and accusations of wrongdoing against her so you dont seem to be getting the discretion,MLeek
good luck,MLeek
youre becoming absurd in an attempt to hold on to your anger with her and find wrongdoing,MLeek
you met her in midmarch its now almost the end of may thats a very normal range of time for people to connect sincerely but for ones to realize its not going to work out,MLeek
yes that was unkind but shes entitled to her belief and if she doesnt believe he can handle it then shes right to end it regardless of what he thinks of his own capacity i do not trust youre capable of meeting my needs,MLeek
would be more accurate but its the same thing and valid its suboptimal phrasing but she appears to have owned her choices no problem,MLeek
but seriously his behaviour here is reminding me why 29 is my absolute floor im inclined to agree with her assessment,MLeek
most people experience validation from relationships of all kinds,MLeek
youre looking for a reason to make her the bad guy because she disappointed you but you dont have a good one she just disappointed you because she didnt want what you wanted,MLeek
the assumption she didnt tell you just about as soon as she figured it out herself is the bitter and entitled bullshit i mean those are the kinds of negative thoughts you need to stop indulging in,MLeek
while i think its inappropriate he didnt tell you if he never replied its not that weird that he kept it to himself,MLeek
a lot of people especially men do not like to admit they are being harassed and it is harassment it may be lowkey but it is that,MLeek
i dont block the man who sends me these sorts of texts because a i worry if he realizes hes blocked he may escalate and b i want to have a record of the behaviour in case he ever does escalate its not a comfortable thing to tell a new partner about but i always do,MLeek
yeah but youre letting these thoughts fester we all have passing thoughts after a break up that are are negative and irrational you have to let them go not ponder them further,MLeek
they wont support you being happy or kind in the future so drop that bullshit,MLeek
be disappointed not irrationally bitter and entitled,MLeek
you werent lied too,MLeek
you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you,MLeek
the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women,MLeek
this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm,MLeek
so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly,MLeek
and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying,MLeek
she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal,MLeek
that was successful communication you had a good time for a while you had some basic compatibility but once she knew it wasnt for her she told you,MLeek
maybe the problem isnt your income or the age range maybe the problem is you need to learn to handle rejection most connections with anyone of any age are gonna just not quite work out,MLeek
just stop texting him entirely,MLeek
you rejected him when you rejected his intensity and talk about future wifey that was rejecting him you didnt want what he wanted and thats okay it was the right thing to do,MLeek
let it be a rejection and let it be over,MLeek
then your marriage is over,MLeek
youve decided it,MLeek
youre just trying to bully her into being the one who says it out loud it may take years but eventually she will and youll tell yourself your hands are clean but they are not,MLeek
what you are doing is cowardly and manipulative at least as shitty as anything youve accused her of here,MLeek
if you actually want to be married stop this bullshit and go talk to a counsellor together,MLeek
youre the one who described actively threatening the relationship,MLeek
whats worse you dont even mean it you dont want to divorce right so youre just being manipulative and hurtful when you speak that way to her at least shes being honest with you about her unhappiness,MLeek
so why dont you shit or get off the pot stop making it all her job to leave your ass,MLeek
the rank hypocrisy is shocking you sound like a teenager not a 35yearold,MLeek
either get a marriage counsellor involved to help you both do better you yes you really need to do a lot better than this or stop being such a little shit and hire a lawyer yourself,MLeek
just let him avoid you its fine for him to avoid you,MLeek
this is resolved just fine,MLeek
stop trying to pursue the fwbcasual fling with him he is not equippedinterested in that dont get bent outta shape that a 22yearold cant explain his boundaries and emotional needs clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him,MLeek
the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself,MLeek
then you earned every downvote,MLeek
everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct,MLeek
edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic,MLeek
that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you,MLeek
if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas,MLeek
dont just vaguely demand someone else spell it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless,MLeek
that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this,MLeek
if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this,MLeek
does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural,MLeek
if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure,MLeek
i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay,MLeek
if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly,MLeek
no this is a terrible idea,MLeek
shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship,MLeek
tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning,MLeek
i didnt say there werent many good things,MLeek
but look at what this bad thing is cause its a fricking huge one,MLeek
1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns,MLeek
2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening,MLeek
3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life,MLeek
its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase,MLeek
you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you,MLeek
its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place,MLeek
the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping,MLeek
its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue,MLeek
the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30,MLeek
its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers,MLeek
in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that,MLeek
but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt,MLeek
dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing,MLeek
are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself,MLeek
you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your bpd,MLeek
no,MLeek
id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing,MLeek
but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right,MLeek
you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her,MLeek
nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it,MLeek
the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life,MLeek
youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming,MLeek
right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time,MLeek
once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or so of moving cut him loose,MLeek
you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved,MLeek
absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still,MLeek
however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are,MLeek
but if you look at all the posts  not just the juicy ones  most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool,MLeek
this is totally old school analogue behaviour  the whisper network  in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women,MLeek
a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser,MLeek
you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s,MLeek
we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another,MLeek
this man isnt going to save you,MLeek
he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner,MLeek
on top of all of that you dont trust him he lies,MLeek
this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself,MLeek
ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end,MLeek
it happened last summer in ohio,MLeek
her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law,MLeek
women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants,MLeek
i love these she dumped me for no reason stories,MLeek
one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like,MLeek
he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home,MLeek
but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested,MLeek
i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up,MLeek
i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments,MLeek
i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times,MLeek
even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it,MLeek
oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety  totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development,MLeek
notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men,MLeek
its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy,MLeek
the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him,MLeek
that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much,MLeek
i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better  but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her,MLeek
exactly this,MLeek
he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him,MLeek
op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him,MLeek
ops response was imperfect  shes a great target for his style of bullshit  but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her,MLeek
he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her,MLeek
and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her into silence,MLeek
classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man,MLeek
only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op,MLeek
fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes,MLeek
but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles,MLeek
when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats,MLeek
maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out,MLeek
major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag,MLeek
he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel,MLeek
hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life,MLeek
its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that,MLeek
some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal,MLeek
this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons,MLeek
thats worse all of that is worse,MLeek
he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose,MLeek
it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you,MLeek
this is so much worse,MLeek
her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice,MLeek
him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void,MLeek
hes not confused,MLeek
hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone,MLeek
hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say,MLeek
and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped,MLeek
id walk,MLeek
this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont,MLeek
but im his age,MLeek
and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era,MLeek
a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either,MLeek
4 year olds when they are called kiddo,MLeek
24 year olds when they are called kiddo,MLeek
me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis,MLeek
me when my catty sil does,MLeek
its almost like context and intent matter in human communication,MLeek
this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you,MLeek
i would consider the friendship done,MLeek
his behaviour was horrible and your response was not productive but it doesnt really matter,MLeek
generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle,MLeek
it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant,MLeek
there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is,MLeek
let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic,MLeek
best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging this performance,MLeek
its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood,MLeek
theres no going back there is not much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama,MLeek
allow it to end grieve it out and move on,MLeek
your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you,MLeek
your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her,MLeek
just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement,MLeek
speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory,MLeek
document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself,MLeek
youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years,MLeek
you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence,MLeek
you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries,MLeek
you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative,MLeek
youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys,MLeek
expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them,MLeek
leave him blocked youve communicated clearly,MLeek
you can divorce someone for any reason youd like,MLeek
but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not,MLeek
but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall,MLeek
it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good,MLeek
most of us loved this before it was branded psl,MLeek
in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette,MLeek
your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure,MLeek
you need to work on your insecurities in therapy,MLeek
what he said was careless not an insult he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard,MLeek
and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy,MLeek
you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating,MLeek
shitty things be shitty,MLeek
sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part,MLeek
first ask her what support she wantsneeds,MLeek
second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true  the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time,MLeek
some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it,MLeek
do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel  she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out,MLeek
keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support,MLeek
dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind,MLeek
to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju,MLeek
also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters,MLeek
from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second,MLeek
oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth,MLeek
i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like,MLeek
you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office  especially if she intends to get personal tax benefits or write offs for it  then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying,MLeek
and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself,MLeek
i wouldnt want to be married to either of you,MLeek
yelling is unacceptable to me,MLeek
however so are constant accusations especially public drunken ones,MLeek
what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband,MLeek
most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours,MLeek
stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him,MLeek
if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket,MLeek
youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget before you agreed to go,MLeek
if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend,MLeek
i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him,MLeek
even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her,MLeek
so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments,MLeek
youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up,MLeek
youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too,MLeek
hes doing exactly what he wants,MLeek
if he wanted to be at those appointments he would be,MLeek
if he wanted to be dating you he would be,MLeek
he doesnt,MLeek
and he probably never will,MLeek
stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent,MLeek
agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner,MLeek
same answer hes not your partner,MLeek
its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this,MLeek
the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being,MLeek
im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be,MLeek
i just dont want to break up with him,MLeek
its a situationship by definition you are not together,MLeek
we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter,MLeek
great you need to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another,MLeek
i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre,MLeek
you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that,MLeek
dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps,MLeek
you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable,MLeek
it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it,MLeek
got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i even got around to it,MLeek
you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience,MLeek
i think you feel like a single mom because you are one,MLeek
stop the situationship just be coparents,MLeek
hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one,MLeek
the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being,MLeek
let it go and focus on being coparents,MLeek
she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest,MLeek
go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex,MLeek
you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices,MLeek
you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children,MLeek
if it doesnt matter where you live then you live near were your children are right now that is the default,MLeek
i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions,MLeek
but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer,MLeek
he definitely wants to fix it,MLeek
if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll continue to tolerate it,MLeek
youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother,MLeek
he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you,MLeek
he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner,MLeek
you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you,MLeek
this was my ex too,MLeek
i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head,MLeek
he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand,MLeek
i wouldnt i would text him after i post it,MLeek
conversation can evolve from there or not,MLeek
make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest,MLeek
id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn,MLeek
the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack,MLeek
you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt,MLeek
try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you,MLeek
if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal,MLeek
go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact,MLeek
its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage,MLeek
tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live,MLeek
a few times ive given advice like thats not something you can reasonably expect from a matchhook up youre looking for a very specific service and you should be hiring someone and tipping well and completely been oblivious to the fact i was suggesting a crime,MLeek
you cannot control how he feels,MLeek
you can tell him youre concerned thats fair but dont get into specifics,MLeek
youre concerned hes stressed out and overworked youre concerned he wont accept advice or listen to doctors on the best way to manage his pain or his diet,MLeek
dont assume you have the answers dont be your mothers little helper speak for yourself and admit youre worried you want better for him than he seems to be choosing for himself and as someone who loves him that makes you sad,MLeek
youre a piggy bank for a man who hid his child from you for four months,MLeek
the fact hes an unreliable dad isnt something you can fix for him,MLeek
being a reliable parent means showing up he cannot do that without the financial support of the new gf he lied to,MLeek
you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life,MLeek
but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister,MLeek
that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this,MLeek
your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids,MLeek
you cannot fix crazy,MLeek
your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy,MLeek
and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really,MLeek
your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks such irrational and hateful things about you from your life,MLeek
you need to stop seek therapy,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else,MLeek
it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here,MLeek
he connected more with someone else,MLeek
its just a rejection its a normal part of dating,MLeek
the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist,MLeek
stop supporting and start laying down some expectations,MLeek
if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind,MLeek
that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling,MLeek
you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings,MLeek
stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about,MLeek
youre incompatible,MLeek
and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs in order to perform and set goals yuck,MLeek
but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children,MLeek
shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery,MLeek
also shes way too old to be this much of a brat,MLeek
dont do this,MLeek
use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface,MLeek
whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way,MLeek
if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all,MLeek
hes not a faithful man he never has been,MLeek
can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you,MLeek
you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it,MLeek
youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this one,MLeek
nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated,MLeek
yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense,MLeek
it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways  with legitimate anger or clear boundaries  that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us,MLeek
this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser,MLeek
it doesnt get better for op until op gets out,MLeek
youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer,MLeek
this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner,MLeek
at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same,MLeek
hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice,MLeek
just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama,MLeek
so all these people like each other more than they like you,MLeek
which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in,MLeek
its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them,MLeek
the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead,MLeek
if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit,MLeek
id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things,MLeek
hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue,MLeek
you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be dealbreakers,MLeek
emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements,MLeek
yeah i dont get it,MLeek
my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable,MLeek
yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves,MLeek
that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully,MLeek
and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know,MLeek
i dont think youre being the critical thinker you imagine you are,MLeek
but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out,MLeek
your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did,MLeek
all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes,MLeek
you really should consider why your story  the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her  is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap,MLeek
the devil has plenty of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner,MLeek
why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him,MLeek
and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere,MLeek
its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable,MLeek
no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive,MLeek
op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap,MLeek
it does to me,MLeek
but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals,MLeek
unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes,MLeek
id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up,MLeek
not because your feelings are irrational but because grief  especially grief and processing after long term abuse  are super fucking complicated,MLeek
you can ask her to do this work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people,MLeek
shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life,MLeek
you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in,MLeek
your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations,MLeek
becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is,MLeek
becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute,MLeek
laugh,MLeek
and then hopefully wake up from the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog,MLeek
we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard,MLeek
look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit,MLeek
ive happily agreed they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why,MLeek
friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves,MLeek
they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake,MLeek
while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and fianc should still be standing up for his own choices  even if those choices are mistakes,MLeek
does it matter,MLeek
most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time,MLeek
and,MLeek
i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me,MLeek
this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material,MLeek
unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off,MLeek
dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too  and then put this one back on the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy,MLeek
i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together,MLeek
basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo,MLeek
no you probably shouldnt,MLeek
you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life,MLeek
you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you,MLeek
youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform,MLeek
youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt have to agree she doesnt agree,MLeek
these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has,MLeek
take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife,MLeek
your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass,MLeek
dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal,MLeek
tell your mother kindly but firmly that your invites do not include him unless you explicitly include him you need to avoid these misunderstandings in the future by being clear if he is coming or not,MLeek
even if he isnt cheating on you this isnt okay,MLeek
if hes not cheating on you then hes trying to punish you for forgetting to pay your bill during your time of crisis and grief,MLeek
you dont need proof hes cheating to get the fuck rid of him over this,MLeek
a person who tells you they are sooooooo nice and sooooooo loyal and no one else will treat you as well as they will is a completely trash person,MLeek
do not make peace with this,MLeek
do not marry this man,MLeek
this is a major warning sign,MLeek
he will abuse you,MLeek
then he will tell you its your own fault while declaring all other men are worse abusers than he is which is a lie he tells so he gets what he wants he wants to abuse you,MLeek
why not just block him thats perfectly acceptable and very clear response,MLeek
and if not that then you tell him to stop,MLeek
dude that sounds flirty i dont like it cut it out,MLeek
if he denies it or pretends its not or its no big deal dont argue with him just say good im glad thats not what you meant cut it out anyways i dont like it thanks,MLeek
its a bad idea to date someone in their 20s,MLeek
the age gap should bother you more than it bothers her and it should motivate you to make a responsible respectful choice based on your life experience,MLeek
to answer your questions generally i think dealbreakers prior the first date should be short and sweet and cover the really big things guns religion sex before marriage and abortion vegan diets if that is a big one for you those sorts of biggies the conversation about what could a relationship look like how much time will we spend together and where how do you see a relationship with your children developing is a conversation you have after 23 pleasant dates and you both agree you want to continue to see one another,MLeek
i mean it sounds like the guy is a sexist asshat you should reduce your time with,MLeek
its okay to decide not to invest in friendships with people if you dont like how they treat you or others,MLeek
stop being a bystander its gross if youre not going to call him out at least step away from him,MLeek
youre not,MLeek
you are not 5yearolds call dibs on the best ball as the bell rings,MLeek
you treated her like a human being,MLeek
hes treating you like a competitor in a sport where she is the favourite big red ball and he cant figure out how to dibs her,MLeek
keep her friendship reconsider his,MLeek
she wasnt that into you,MLeek
you were into her and kept hopingimagining she felt the same,MLeek
maybe she kinda liked you at some point but then she didnt,MLeek
there is no problem here just a normal disappointment,MLeek
the only thing youre doing wrong is refusing to accept this as a totally normal bit of normal human disappointment most of the people you like arent gonna like you back,MLeek
youre both being absurd and kinda gross,MLeek
this woman has told you shes not available for new connections at the moment,MLeek
he doesnt give a fuck he thinks this is a game to be won not a bunch of human people with feelings and free choices and youre acting like he bought her by driving you around and being your friend that is also pretty gross,MLeek
opt out of this bullshit when he makes passiveaggressive comments tell him hes being kinda unfriendly over this shit and to cut it out be a bro not a whiny brat you value his friendship but if hes gonna act like a 5th grader who called dibs on a girl who told him she isnt single anyways its gonna damage respect between you two as adult human beings,MLeek
if you dont want to keep speaking her then dont but this isnt about who falls in love more this is about not surrounding yourself with men who treat women as trophies and you as the competition its toxic af its not friendly,MLeek
when i see no drama my brain immediately translates it to i am the drama i bring the only permissible drama,MLeek
no drama is the poor cousin of all my exes are crazy i wouldnt say is guarantees gaslighting  that term is getting super inflated but it does mean they seek out and create toxic dynamics and at very best lack selfawareness,MLeek
yeah,MLeek
and you wont die cause you cant afford insulin or chemo or got in a car crash and your family wont loose the house andor all their savings trying to keep you alive,MLeek
everyone on the planet who gets this deal would fucking go to war against the us if they tried to export your the idea of a tiny bit less taxes but everything else is way fucking worse and only the millionaires benefit,MLeek
i literally do not know how so many americans wake up each day knowing they are one er visit away from total financial ruin,MLeek
tell me youre an adult man who wants a mommy without te nm fuck it,MLeek
you are loved and awesome,MLeek
he was telling a story telling a lie because his ego couldnt accept the rejection he couldnt handle the consequences for his bad behaviour he needed to tell a story where you unworthy of him so he didnt have ti address the fact he was clearly objectively unworthy of you,MLeek
its been years since i broke up with my ex and some of his nasty stories about me still slip into my life telling me im unworthy or im greedy or im dumb im shocked how many years later im fighting his narratives even though they were lies then and they are definitely lies now,MLeek
your brain it trying to make sense of someone you cared for and were vulnerable with telling you such terrible lies,MLeek
you end all contact you keep reminding yourself these were selfserving lies that had everything to do with his weakness and hatefulness and nothing to do with you as a person,MLeek
honestly the best thing to do is leave these conversations i tell them to google motivated reasoning and then go touch grass,MLeek
its not a data argument to begin with no data scientist would take these with anything short of a 10lb bag of street salt thats not even what average means this was a dataasmarketing for paid dating apps a decade ago apps that are selling a product to predominately straight men by convincing them they require a paid advantage,MLeek
marketing departments make graphs all the time that i roll my eyes at and say well that is technically not a lie thats all that is happening here,MLeek
are we talking oh that 18 year old has great emotional regulation expresses boundaries clearly while also being empathetic to those around her,MLeek
or do we mean shes a free baby sitter and chauffeur for younger siblings and isnt thats a great perk for her parents,MLeek
there are definitely ways to praise young women for being mature or wise that reflect their individual strengths and not their usefulnesssubmission to others,MLeek
irrelevant,MLeek
this would be a bit funny from a 21 one year old but its embarrassingly stupid from a man his age who wants to be a parent,MLeek
if ubi does happen ha and ai takes over significant parts of our world school will change a lot but children will still need to be educated in order to be people we want to share the world with and maybe even live fulfilling lives,MLeek
its pretty obvious this man just wanted you to shame her into handing the child over to you and then you would be responsible for the care of him and the child,MLeek
glad you escaped id suggest you be very very skeptical of anything he ever told you about her whatever her struggles are now clearly when they were together she had two babies to take care of and one of them was a resentful and manipulative shit of a 450months old,MLeek
i would not date a man who thought it was my job to sort out his parenting and custody issues with his ex thats insane,MLeek
he was being a shitty parent and trying to coerce you into doing the job for him this terrible attitude towards responsibility and work likely his assumptions about womens work was going to continue,MLeek
if he had won custody youd have basically been single parenting that infant can all but promise it breaking up over his lack of responsibility and blameshifting was completely wise and not at all petty,MLeek
then start with your obygn or a standard therapist and ask for a referral,MLeek
if youre serious about these concerns address them seriously addressing them seriously is not going to happen on reddit,MLeek
33 isnt an older father those studies usually begin at 35 to 40,MLeek
you should be talking to a doctor not google not reddit and not a sociopath,MLeek
i think trying to round your hall pass up into polyamoury before speaking to your wife is toxic as fuck swinging is completely and utterly different from poly most swingers will be the very first to tell you that  and makes me perfectly comfortable expecting better from this man hes not a novice he should have the basics down so trying to build a new relationship outside of the marriage for weeks without speaking to his wife thats taking it past poor communication about boundaries into a realm id consider manipulative and coercive,MLeek
i say this as a practicing enm person who has seen a lot of wellintentioned people mess it up this is not a mess up i could assume was wellintentioned experience has taught me that people who really want to take good care of all their partners and relationships arent this stupid this mess up would mean both of these people are outta my life forever they are not safe or reliable,MLeek
im not a fan of keeping such an open mind that ones brain falls right out the best ill give this man he was very conveniently confused and when someones confusion is that convenient to them and what they want for themselves trust is severely damaged,MLeek
if i heard hall pass id assume it was a onetime hook up thing so yeah hit it and quit it and i probably wouldnt want to participate in that sounds dicey and not what id want in an enm encounter,MLeek
but i really dont know what a hall pass was in this marriage and neither does op and apparently neither did these two thats kind of the whole problem and its not ops problem,MLeek
so this chad was a sorta awkward and totally ageappropriate teenage boyfriend right,MLeek
no one dates someone 20 years younger then them by accident or because they are looking for a relationship with and equal rooted in mutual respect,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
you dont seem to be open to advice,MLeek
its reasonable for your gf to not want to marry you and live with your mom its reasonable for her not to want to marry someone who is planning on financially supporting his mother for the rest of her life,MLeek
it is strange that you find this surprising and its only coming up now,MLeek
this isnt insecure  a bit sexist maybe but not insecure this is a reasonable boundary you should halt all plans and probably break up if you plan on financially supporting or living with your mother for the rest of her life,MLeek
outside of very conservative upbringings very few women are going to sign up to marry you under those terms,MLeek
no absolutely not you are not required to make yourself of service to this messy toxic man or his wife you are completely correct this is not yours to fix why are you still in contact with either of them there is nothing for you to gain from that,MLeek
this is not your circus not your monkeys if he violated their relationship agreement that is the two of them to sort out it has nothing to do with you,MLeek
if you feel like you want to do her this huge emotional service and massive favour invite her to contact you via email with her questions and you stick to factual responses ie not about what you felt but about timelines and what information you received when,MLeek
but even that i would not do if these two are at war with one another there is no good outcome for you if you go wandering out in the middle of the battlefield id advise you to end contact entirely with both of them,MLeek
i mean this with respect and compassion but you need to go touch grass,MLeek
youre giving over way too much of yourself to this and twisting this into stories just to get down on yourself stop trying to place those highschool pickme dramas into this thats not whats going on here,MLeek
your hurt feelings over this make sense for a few minutes but this is all a bit much dont wallow dont fixate she wasnt into you she probably wasnt into you for something causal either let it go,MLeek
a woman who plans to have somewhere to be after the date doesnt plan to have sex with you be sure this all adds up to not that into you,MLeek
honestly women in their 40s are well aware of that stigma and they will tell you if they are into something casual with you if she did not odd are very good she was not,MLeek
you need to relax and let them know which dishes you need to access and that you are not able to reach x y and z in the position they were moved too ask they be moved back or that you take a look together,MLeek
youll be fine its fine to ask for things you use frequently to be stored at a height you can access safely,MLeek
you can feel how you feel but she didnt do anything wrong,MLeek
you know this is about your insecurities and instead of taking it so personally you should be taking this as clarity she was correct you were not compatible as dating partners you were not looking for the same thing,MLeek
if you really want to be her friend then you can mention to her that he considers himself redpilled and suggest she google what that means before she wastes too much energy,MLeek
but you also dont have to be friends if youre not happy being her friend which may involve being aware or even seeing her connect with someone else,MLeek
you dont trust him dont fuck someone you dont trust,MLeek
its not complicated youre not as compatible as you had previously thought you were just end it,MLeek
two hours on the phone is a long time for adults with full lives,MLeek
if youre doing that several times a week im not surprised shes not on the whole time and that its not that satisfying,MLeek
ldrs are tough but you need to focus on the kinds of connection and length that fuels that relationship not the kind that just checks the box of we talked today,MLeek
you mean your exboyfriend right,MLeek
this is not rocky this is risky,MLeek
this is not just disrespectful behaviour its dangerous,MLeek
this is not about him getting off even this is about him taking sexual pleasure in deceit and violation of you and of other women,MLeek
this isnt about you or your body this is about the fact he likes lying and ripping women down generally this is what he does this is who he is that is what you can put your trust in you can trust 100 that this guy likes to shame insult and lie so he will do that,MLeek
the quicker you get away from him the quicker you can start to heal,MLeek
this is sexual assault hes dangerous,MLeek
he is going to lose control again because he feels entitled to use your body this way without your consent take your bags leave never come back,MLeek
unless you want to end up having a baby with your rapist because staying in this relationship will almost certainly lead you to being bound to him forever by the baby you have after he rapes you,MLeek
no dude quit it take that venting to the therapist your ex was an abusive monster no one is debating that or ignoring the impact it had on you and your family but that actually isnt the issue today,MLeek
the issue today is your current partner isnt behaving up to snuff in a home with your children fulltime and isnt prepared to do any of the work to improve the situation and your brillant plan appears to be treating her like a convenient income for the next four years or so and then see how you two feel about each other,MLeek
shell probably hate you by then if someone treated you like nothing but a financial crutch tell me you wouldnt,MLeek
get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship im not saying you have to leave but you and your partner both need to realize that is reality and a possibility that is the only way to untrap yourselves it to be willing to seriously contemplate life apart  and then either choose to do the work to stay together or not,MLeek
dude just no,MLeek
this isnt ethicalnonmonogamy or openness this is just drama and you didnt even want opennesses to begin with,MLeek
at best shes confused and not emotionally available for a serious relationship at worst she lacks selfawareness and basic consideration to the point that makes her manipulative or even malicious,MLeek
just no,MLeek
your amazing partner didnt want you to fulltime parent your own kids and now you cant leave a relationship youre all miserable in because you feel perhaps correctly that you cannot afford to,MLeek
pretty obvious why no one feels secure or particuarly loved in this situation,MLeek
get your kids and yourself the mental health support you can and seriously reconsider your ability to remain in the district without remaining in this relationship,MLeek
part of fully acknowledging that what you did was wrong is accepting the consequences,MLeek
the consequences are that you are not welcome you dont always get another chance it doesnt matter if the other person is shitty or if you think you deserve it it doesnt always happen and frankly do you really want it too these people are insane and the brought out the worst possible behaviour in you a sane person would stay the fuck away from them and not try to seek their approval,MLeek
your bf needs to figure out how he balances his time it feels complicated but its actually not any more practically complicated than that accept have some grace ask for the time you need and respect that he still values some time with these friends,MLeek
hopefully he can recognize that the toxicity at this point is coming from only onedirection  not you who has apologized and will now accept the situation with grace  but his socalled friends who are apparently totally cool with assault and insults and regularly drink to excess this all rather gross for a bunch of 30yearolds,MLeek
any woman who doesnt chase you after shes slept with you is a woman who belongs to the streets,MLeek
tell me youre a shitty lay without telling me youre a shitty lay,MLeek
i agree there isnt we dont know,MLeek
and i wouldnt risk it not this one not if my instincts were what ops appears to be,MLeek
you really seem genuinely confused by this but,MLeek
its okay to demand more from a partner than just them not being abusive,MLeek
you dont have to stay with someone just because they dont hit you or call you names,MLeek
he doesnt seem violent himself,MLeek
the bar is beneath the damn floor,MLeek
someones not treating you right if you are concerned they empathize more with the consequences your abuser faced then the experience of being abused thats not just ignorance and it wouldnt be okay even if it was,MLeek
i would simply walk,MLeek
i would trust my instincts if i suspected my new partner felt more for the man who was inconvenienced by the legal ramifications of his abusive actions then he does for his gf the person he actually knows and supposedly cares for who was abused that is a dealbreaker i wouldnt confront i wouldnt explain i would just say no thank you and walk,MLeek
the first joke was careless and could be overlooked as a oneoff poor judgment call but the concern that he thinks believes your abuser was hard done by or just caught a case should not be overlooked i wouldnt confront or even delve into that id just trust my gut and escape that,MLeek
its one thing to not know what to say or make a dumb joke its another entirely to express more empathy for the person who hurt you facing consequences for that behavior than for you having to live with the ramifications of the abuse,MLeek
you shouldnt stay in a relationship where that doubt and fear has even entered your head i wouldnt he might not mean anything by it but i wouldnt roll those dice on someone id only been dating for a few weeks or months,MLeek
edit dumb typo gut not guy,MLeek
its not on her if you cannot treat her with respect,MLeek
youre not actually taking full ownership of the issue here youre not asking for sensitivity youre asking for submission to your bad behaviours and for her to manage your feelings for you youre asking her either meaningful change or hide how she interacts with her classmates because you cannot handle yourself,MLeek
you need to seriously consider if you are capable of being a partner to anyone at the moment  without being emotionally abusive or controlling towards them because by your own description youre crossing that line,MLeek
yeah that typo doesnt help any but it seems like most people got it all the same,MLeek
approach this from a shared goals point of view,MLeek
you both have a shared goal of living together there is a proposal where you could do that more quickly if he was willing to provide you with a better interest rate than the irs and cc companies would,MLeek
show him your plan for repaying them and how youve worked that plan over the last few months then show him how much quicker it would go if you were repaying him at a less aggressive interest rate,MLeek
from there id suggest you hit pause let him go away and think about it dont get too into the weeds right about how much interest youd pay him or about trading rent for repayments instead just give him the information about how quickly youd be out of debt and roughly how much more quickly you could live together,MLeek
tell him you know its a bit strange and you dont want to pressure him into something hes not comfortable with you want to build your life with him regardless so if hes not comfortable with this youll just keep on working the current plan youve shown him on the current timeline,MLeek
stop going back to this well its run dry,MLeek
you were rarely if ever friends,MLeek
you can know this because the friendship faltered or fell apart when either of you were in established relationships or actively dating others you were almost always the pseudopartner the whatif in the other persons life you were oneanothers fantasy but never oneanothers reality those are the hardest things to let go of the things that never really existed except as a hope the honeymoon stage never ends if it never even begins,MLeek
its time to let that hope die be grateful for the good feels find them in a healthy way with someone else,MLeek
most people in their 30s arent dating partners 10 years younger than them cause they want relationships based on mutual respect and clear boundaries,MLeek
personally i think this is a silly and immature way for an adult man to engage with social media but not a betrayal however that really doesnt matter,MLeek
what matters is whether or not this is a dealbreaker for you hes been clear hes going to continue you are entitled to your feelings but your feelings dont make the rules he gets to agree or disagree and he disagrees you have to decide if that is the kind of relationship you want to stay in or not,MLeek
okay  first off you havent won squat yet,MLeek
some couples try to maintain perfect financial equity but at some point that system tends to break down a real lifetime of teamwork is rarely going to break down 5050 on all fronts,MLeek
if you have a shared goal of homeownership and that could be accelerated or improved by using part of your winnings its a bit silly imo not to be open to other ways to protect your equity besides a perfect 5050 split of the downpayment its not that it would be unfair to her in any way just that it would be kind of silly and bizarre not to factor this change in your financial reality into a holistic plan for your lives together  especially if kids are in the cards,MLeek
buying a home or getting married involves some level of financial risk to both parties you can manage that risk but you cannot erase it not if you want a partnership,MLeek
if either of you wins or inherits a large sum of money it makes sense that the shared plan and goals be reevaluated and that plan should include some protection for individual assets i dont think either of you is showing much sense or nuance on this at all,MLeek
break up with her and give her a deadline for leaving your home a week or two at most,MLeek
you could look for legal advice to support you in this but frankly she is undocumented you could hand her some contact numbers for charitiesngo in your area that supports people in her position but shes unlikely to try to push for tenants rights or 90 days notice,MLeek
dont talk about the things tell her plainly the relationship is over it doesnt matter what she does now doesnt matter if she gets a job tomorrow the relationship is still over,MLeek
if you can offer her cash towards a plane ticket but dont give her anything until she takes her things and leaves and never give her anything more than what you agreed too at that moment then change the locks pay if necessary to have them changed its worth it,MLeek
in the meantime depending on how concerned you are with her behavior between the time you tell her to leave and the day she actually does ask friends if you can store anything of value money or sentimental with them and make sure to keep your technology money any passwords out of her reach,MLeek
the issue is youre feeling a lack of intimacy in your relationship currently,MLeek
the issue is not that she had a past enjoyable sexual experience with someone else,MLeek
you probably have things to talk about it this isnt it,MLeek
accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them,MLeek
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long,MLeek
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so,MLeek
this was known bullshit in 1796 and its bullshit now its an excuse men use to justify themselves in preying on women they are assuming are either stupid manipulative or weakwilled there nothing about it that is a good idea sane men shouldnt want partners who test them that way to begin with and there is nearly no evidence of women engaging in that behavior  just a lot of rejected men saying they must this theory is just straight misogyny because rejection sucks and lots of men will do anything to negate it,MLeek
you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with for any reason,MLeek
and yes tolerance for casual racism is a rather good reason,MLeek
most people when they find themselves in a crowd of people yelling slurs or say wearing swastikas or hanging nooses at very least leave mike didnt even want to distance himself from eric mike doesnt think the problem is with eric,MLeek
please stop asking reddit you might be finding more validation by creating these variations in the story but the end result is the same,MLeek
break up with her if you do not want to be with her,MLeek
or or seek therapy to manage your emotions in more rational ways,MLeek
her behaviour basically makes sense to me she avoided a past hookup in public who from your previous versions was unkind to her and talked shit about her with his friends and she gave you details about the encounter with him when you kept on probing for more information because you didnt accept her initial brief explanation in your earlier versions you were not the least bit concerned about her safety or only suspicious about the details so now you have more details and you dont like them either,MLeek
your choices and behaviours here make so little sense that i sincerely hope this is fiction,MLeek
id be okay with a return date of 34 months perhaps but 612 months with me using all my vacation to fly to them nah i couldnt sustain a healthy relationship on those terms certainly not one that was only 8 months old,MLeek
i dont think you need to be really clingy to not be okay with this,MLeek
im fiercely independent and have gone a month or two without seeing my partner when worktravel have required it but would i commit to 612 months of an ldr with only maybe a few visits with a man id been dating of ra less than year probably not thats a bad use of my time and energy for a situation that doesnt suit me nothing needy or clingy about that,MLeek
just ignore it but keep your eyes open for ways to move out of his department,MLeek
this man tried to use his position to coerce you into an affair and now hes trying to create plausible deniability,MLeek
continue to document everything,MLeek
he wasnt your friend and you cannot become his,MLeek
he only saw you as a potential affair partner,MLeek
he acted out and retaliated against you when you didnt play along with his fantasy,MLeek
hr may not want to admit what happened but everyone with two brain cells to rub together understands what happened,MLeek
the only thing more you can do to minimize the harm this man can do to you is look for a positive move out of his department before he manufactors a negative one,MLeek
im sensing there might be some downsides to spending a few millennia telling men that god made females for them,MLeek
yeah this is the bullshit that works in the movie dont do that,MLeek
you should bring your own timeline to the meeting though and let her know that you two do choose to reconcile you would plan on purposing in x to x number of months months not years,MLeek
ultimatums get shit on because they dont feel very good to receive but when they are honest they are important she was 100 honest about what she needed in this relationship and she walked when you couldnt meet that that wasnt controlling that is clear honest communication,MLeek
she cannot put a timeline on your healing but she is 100 entitled to place a timeline on her own needs in order for the relationship to move forward,MLeek
just be transparent about what changed your mind dont actually make it all about how wonderful she is focus on what you have recognized about yourself and need to change to in order to build the life you want with her be clear that while you want her the person youre changing for is you because that how change lasts,MLeek
you may not be able to eat your cake and have it too,MLeek
all you can do is be just as transparent and clear as you are here and then youll likely need to step back and give her some time to process this information her initial reaction is likely to be anxious and angry and to feel abandoned youre going to have to let her move through those feelings and figure out what she needs to express to you because those feelings are gonna be valid,MLeek
youre only eight months in and youre suggesting going into and ldr basically for at least that long again its a huge ask of a young relationship,MLeek
most people would break up it would be totally reasonable for her to decide not to remain in a committed relationship with someone making the choice you want to make it may just not work for her,MLeek
your gf doesnt believe her friend will cheat she cares for her friend and the friend is wasted you may be right but youre probably not going to convince your gf to think badly of someone she clearly cares for,MLeek
and youre really having the wrong fight here,MLeek
instead of getting worked up about a bunch of women trying to keep their dumbass drunk friend safe just tell your gf plainly that you wouldnt find her friends behaviour acceptable in your own relationship you wouldnt do it and youd like your gf not to do that either thats the agreement you actually need between the two of you about the boundaries when dancingout at the club,MLeek
in your shoes id be far more concerned about your gfs comfort around drinking to excess and her willingness to take on caretaking roles for her friends in dangerous moments having a frank conversation about what i find acceptable is an easy problem to address trying to talk to your gf about the fact her friend has a substance andor impulse control issue is way harder if one of my friends behaved this way more than once i would decline to go out with her until she got her shit together not because of the risk of cheating but because its not any fun to cockblocking for a drunken moron on the regular,MLeek
i would be more inclined to agree if i thought for a second he was actually concerned with the cost of and access to healthy food and not with just punishing those he deems unworthy,MLeek
this would seem to me to point to large issues in how you deal with finances,MLeek
some couples can nickelanddime like this but personally i think its toxic and counterproductive once you live together,MLeek
if the book is important to you then it doesnt matter what he thinks get the book then end contact if you want to end contact his ego is not relevant to this at all you cannot control what he thinks or feels so why waste any of your time on it,MLeek
but shit if you take your book collections that seriously have a loaner copy i never loan out my copy of my favourite book i have a second copy for the purpose of loaning out its dorian gray you could have grabbed a copy for him for less than 5 dont give people the copies you are attached too in the future,MLeek
is this some sort of first edition a rare find of a book with a dedication inside from your dead relatives or something,MLeek
cause unless this book is irreplaceable youre the one playing games,MLeek
dont pretend to be friends just dont be friends if you think hes keeping you around for a ego trip,MLeek
you drew a boundary about a kind of joking you didnt find funny and didnt feel was healthy for either of you thats not throwing the past in her face thats asking her to not to continue to make jokes that you do not enjoy,MLeek
its reasonable to acknowledge her feelings  she was hurt by your comments and thats not insane to feel hurt  but the message wasnt and shouldnt be intended as an attack its just not funny for you you want to move past it not joke about it,MLeek
all of this i feel for the guy shit as he may be that would be an awful experience and im glad he made it home safely,MLeek
however if any woman had stopped to help a nakedass man in the woods and been attacked  or worse  by said men all the same people bemoaning this guys plight would be blaming her for not using her common sense to avoid the obvious danger of the crazy naked man,MLeek
men know other men are dangerous they act on that knowledge ever fucking day they just dont like it when that reality is reflected in womans choices in ways that inconvenience them personally,MLeek
do you that think men and queer folks up and down the binary dont ghost,MLeek
then dont be friends with her,MLeek
mutations are normal variations within a species individuals dont really undergo speciation groups do its a longterm process not a mutation in a single individual,MLeek
you are free to call yourself a nonhuman and free to not choose to be friends with people who do not honour that thats all ya got,MLeek
no the only problem isnt her communication and the other problems might not be worth solving better to call it off entirely,MLeek
but op can and still get past this bullshit i cant actually say what i want he should just know when i say i feel in a good relationship that will often happen but even if the best relationships actual conversations about actual disagreements are required at times,MLeek
and in a really shit relationship doing so will help you waste less time,MLeek
hey im all for op breaking up with him,MLeek
but if youre not able to express what you would like your partner to do and have a conversation about that then youre setting yourself up to be immature and gameplaying and disappointed thats childrens games adults express reasonable boundaries and expectations and walk away if they are not met being willing to walk away when someone isnt going to offer the kind of relationship you want to be in is the opposite of controlling what is controlling is not telling them and trying to manipulate them into giving you what you want getting more and more worked up angry and resentful when they do the thing you dont dare to actually ask them to do,MLeek
someone can give a fuck about your feelings and still disagree and make a choice for themselves it happens constantly if you cannot manage disagreement as a couple with clear communication then you shouldnt be a couple,MLeek
you have to be able to actually tell your partner what kind of relationship you want to be in and are willing to be in with them,MLeek
thats not controlling thats having needs wishes and boundaries like a full human being who knows themselves well enough and is mature enough to express what she wants and needs,MLeek
what youre doing instead right now ends up being gameplaying and manipulative you get into bullshit arguments about my feelings are valid which of course they are but thats beside the point here and not the problem what you really need to discuss is okay you and i disagree about what is appropriate here with this new female friend lets talk about boundaries we can both live with and help me feel secure and respected in this relationship,MLeek
if you think hes shady dont date him,MLeek
but either way learn to speak up for yourself its not controlling to tell your partner what you want in a relationship and to try to find an agreement with them that suits both of your needs that is literally what healthy conflict resolution looks like,MLeek
he disagrees,MLeek
he understands that you are uncomfortable he disagrees that he needs to do anything differently because youre having that feeling and you dont seem to have actually asked him to do anything differently,MLeek
being understood is not the same as getting what you want,MLeek
expressing your feelings is not the same as actually asking for someone to change their choice or do something differently next time,MLeek
to communicate in healthy respectful ways you have to actually have to ask for what you wantneed not just repeat your feelings at people,MLeek
if you need a boundary you have to ask for it clearly and he might disagree then you have to actually talk about it explicitly and try find an agreement,MLeek
if you didnt ask for a clear boundary then it wasnt totally insane for him to think that you were just expressing your feelings about the situation and that he did not need to change his actions he disagrees that his actions were a problem and you didnt ask him to change them so he didnt,MLeek
you two have to come to an agreement agreements are what change behaviors not just telling him your feelings and hoping hell figure out what you want and do that instead,MLeek
he made a new friend i can understand why that concerned you a little bit but do you really want to be in a relationship where you see every single new femalehuman in his life as a potential threat i prefer a relationship where i trust my partner to make new friends and observe good boundaries with them,MLeek
there is nothing you can do to control another person you have to be kind and clear and trust that your professor is reasonable,MLeek
thank them for their offer acknowledge youve accepted another and express regret at not working on their team at this time do it asap the quicker you tell them the kinder it is to them,MLeek
if she burns the bridge nothing you can do about that youll have done your best,MLeek
again like i said that is possible but if that is the case then good bullet dodged you dont want to be picked by someone who is using that as their picking criteria if that was how he made his decision then you two were not compatible,MLeek
however more likely he is just telling you hes entering or moving towards an exclusive relationship with someone else so he is ending contact with you and no longer available to date casually,MLeek
sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else,MLeek
you really need to accept that its the truth the rest of this is your internal bullshit and baggage and you need to get a grip on this,MLeek
i said about sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation he still probably would have continued on with someone else you just would have been hurting more when he did,MLeek
i also dont sleep with people on the first date as a matter of principle i want to take the time to reflect on my experience with them and think about the vibe check before i climb into bed if someone rejects me for this reason that is fine because im confident with my choice nevertheless,MLeek
why are you fixating on sex this was not about sex thats your anxiety and insecurities but it has little to do with this you had one good date that fizzled out thats all thats very very normal,MLeek
seriously this isnt a healthy perspective on dating at all go talk to a therapist and work on owning your own power to choose people and express your interest stop talking to your mother if her advice is straight out of 1940,MLeek
you did nothing wrong he was actively he met someone else he may have liked you very much he liked someone else more,MLeek
sleeping with him that night was unlikely to change the situation only make it hurt more,MLeek
its also possible he felt he was purchasing sex with his dinner in which case you dodged a bullet,MLeek
either way this was a nice date and appropraite ending to a connection you didnt have sex you didnt want to have nothing is wrong here thems the breaks,MLeek
this relationship is over,MLeek
the quicker you get yourself the support you need and get an enforceable legal agreement in place the better off your kids will be,MLeek
all the studies suggest that separation when your children are under 4 is way less damaging than doing it later get this work done now use couples counselling to negotiate the end speak to a lawyer get an individual therapist involved for yourself and the support you need,MLeek
apparently there is no other way for women to support one another and build a vibrant community and family except to surrender to this mans and his gods version of servitude to men,MLeek
what this really tells you sadly is this man has no idea how to maintain healthy relationships or lead a fulfilling life as part of a community except to coerce a woman into doing that work for him,MLeek
make a pillow wall or get a bigger bed,MLeek
but also he has to wake you up,MLeek
he just has to nothing else is going to work except to make you uncomfortable whining about you being not nice while youre unconscious is not an excuse you can and should make some suggestions to address this but he has also gotta be willing to advocate for his own sleep if he stopped moving pushed back or woke you up when you disturbed him your habits while unconscious would be far more likely to adjust if he always accommodates these behaviours while youre asleep youll keep doing them while youre asleep because the asleep version of you doesnt have a problem he has to give the sleeping version some consequences for bad behaviour,MLeek
end all contact with her and get therapy immediately,MLeek
youre hitting yourself that is either a serious mental illness or an attempt to manipulate her,MLeek
this isnt about all women this is about you your inability to make healthy choices for yourself right now  including the choice to stop dating her so stop dating her and please get help for the selfharming behaviours they are not her fault they are something you need to address for yourself,MLeek
there is nothing to do except say to your gf i think hes flirting with you do you think hes flirting with you youre entitled to share your opinion and to listen respectfully to hers that is the end of your power,MLeek
and then let her deal with it trust her judgement or dont date her its her classmate they are her boundaries to enforce when she deems it necessary and in the way she feels is appropriate and right for her,MLeek
dont expect your young gf to go around put other men on blast just because youre having a bad feels get a grip manage your own shit and expect your gf to do what she deems necessary and appropriate,MLeek
do you think youre friends if so id recommend you stop considering this a job and instead call it a favour or hobby for which you might be compensated,MLeek
decide in your own head how much youre willing to do without being paid be at peace with that and then once you hit that either say no or ask for payment,MLeek
either that or tell him youre not available for this work any longer as you need to focus on other lines of income but value his friendship its totally fine to turn down work because the terms just dont feel right to you,MLeek
yeah she knows and if she stopped when she was caught then youve called out the behaviour as much as productively possible,MLeek
dont get hung up on battles you cannot win if youre gonna stay in this relationship save your strength the fights that matter if she stopped this one is as resolved as its every going to be,MLeek
exactly an apology in this case is just a pointless attempt at a power play an apology that everyone involves knows is a lie changes nothing its just score keeping if op is gonna stay in this relationship shes gonna need to learn to pick her battles asap,MLeek
what is the line you think can be drawn here,MLeek
you have to force your mother to pretend to apologize for harassing me or you have to be willing to end all contact and probably your childrens contact with your mother if she wont apologize to me,MLeek
the first one is pointless theatre and the second one is a pretty excessive demand for bf and his children to go no contact with his mother even though bf has never actually chosen to introduce op to his mother  if that is what op really needs  for this woman to not be in her life at all  she is probably headed for a breakup because while that is a totally valid need its not likely to be one her partner is going to immediately agree to this toxic unhinged woman is present in his life and hes can demand she treat op with respect when he includes op but he cannot perfectly control his mother if shes inclined to this degree of nonsense,MLeek
absolutely do not reach out to her yourself ever this is not your battle to fight this is 100 between him and his mother,MLeek
however he doesnt control her he can create boundaries he can say if you dont apologize i wont talk to you anymore but frankly that is a waste of a boundary the boundary hes actually going to need is if you cannot be respectful of my new gf when i am ready to introduce you to her then you will see less of me and of the grandchildren until youre willing to behave with respect towards important people in our lives,MLeek
of course she should apologize but shes not gonna and she wouldnt mean it anyways you cant fix other people you dont get to communicate through idiocy and insanity there is nothing to be worked through here youre not gonna move past this this doesnt get resolved with an apology youre gonna live with a toxic and sorta crazy person in your life unless he chooses to cut all contact with her,MLeek
hes fundamentally correct he cannot and should not be having this fight until he needs to have this fight you either need to trust him to step up when it becomes necessary or you need to leave this relationship,MLeek
you know this is a you problem and that you need to work on it if you want happy and healthy relationships in your life with her or anyone,MLeek
if that isnt enough for you how can anything we say fix this,MLeek
speak to a therapist if youre unable to address these feelings and intrusive thoughts yourself,MLeek
go low contact,MLeek
there is nothing to gain from these relationships you only show up for them out of obligation learn to manage those feelings of duty in healthier ways,MLeek
dont fight who they are just minimize the damage they are able to do to you as an adult,MLeek
nah you were right to cut him off,MLeek
he was either inconsiderate or not that into you or both invest your time elsewhere,MLeek
the issue is you dont like her boundaries you keep pushing against them which is why she is further clarifying what behaviour she is willing to accept from you at this time either you do x or im walking away is a boundary a firm one what you are saying here is that she really should walk away from you which means you are also just as responsible for walking away from her at this point,MLeek
stop having a conversation this doesnt require a compromise your accusations are totally out of whack with reality she doesnt have a problem you do if you think shes doing these nasty things to you then there is truly nothing else to talk about you solve your problem by ending the connection that doesnt suit your needs,MLeek
that doesnt seem fair im not selling an ebook or a program or any crypto at all,MLeek
while she might not be perfect youre being really really immature and resentful about this you need to end this its not on her you have to end it because you are not okay with it,MLeek
it makes perfect sense that she may be looking forward to meeting you and possibly seeing if there is something there in a few months when youre in the uk but unwilling to commit to you at this point,MLeek
at this point she is offering you friendship it is valid if she decides that friendship doesnt include details about her dating life some friendships dont she has told you that you are not exclusive and that she is single which is what she needs to be clear about if she not telling you about other dates she may be on that is because she has judged probably correctly that you are overinvested in this connection and will not handle that information well,MLeek
this is all on you man you dont have to like her choices but her choices sound reasonable and yours dont youre judging her extremely harshly for not being willing to commit to an ldr with a person shes never met for many months thats not hostagetaking or manipulative thats sanity you havent been friendzoned you have been person i met online only and will not meet in person for many months zoned because that is what you are right now she sounds pretty clear about what she is offering you right now which is not exclusivity because of course she isnt you live an ocean away and have for months and will for several months more,MLeek
you majorly overinvested in an ldr and youre blaming her for not taking responsibility for your feelings and making it her job to end this connection to protect you from your own poor choices,MLeek
thats not fair its your job to end this if it doesnt work for you,MLeek
her boundaries with you right now make a lot sense  you are not committed to one another youve never even met in person compatibility is still a big question mark no matter how much you enjoy speaking to one another she knows youre overinvesting so shes keeping you on an information diet about her personal life she is telling you to either get a grip and respect her boundaries or opt out,MLeek
your expectations for a level of commitment from a woman you havent even met are extremely unrealistic if this connection is unhealthy for you or making you unhappy you need to leave it its not all her fault that you wont do the right thing for you,MLeek
it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself,MLeek
it sounds like a 30yearold man who is mooching off his stepdad is also now taking advantage of your vulnerability to get yet more financial and practical support for himself  living environment to another slightly less toxic and unsafe living environment but youre still not where you need to be,MLeek
your reaction to this was pretty intense for someone who says shes okay with porn and understands this isnt cheating,MLeek
the obvious problem here is that either he lied or he is so unaware of his own actions and motivations that he couldnt provide an answer for why he screenshots these,MLeek
i have no issues with porn but i find it immature and boundarybusting when people repurpose social media images as if they are porn those women arent producing those images for that reason or consenting plenty of women out there are there is no reason for it unless you enjoy the violation of women who are not consenting to be porn starts plus its just childish in my opinion,MLeek
what he did was probably within normal but lots of normal things are shitty and id be concerned by his lack of honesty andor selfawareness about this habit,MLeek
dude you came for advice youve been given it,MLeek
im not getting into what is the correct amount to charge them because you have completely missed the window to discuss payment you claim to full accept that fact but youre still trying to wiggle outta it the fact that february was within the initial agreement is why that was the appropriate window,MLeek
were not brokers for room rentals in your area were talking about the relationship you can ask for whatever amount you feel youre entitled to but youre likely to damage the relationship thats the advice its not about the dollar value you want to assign,MLeek
still gonna go with no but also who the fuck cares if it does seriously how is this beneficial to you to give your mental energy too youve already done the only thing you can do short of ending the friendship entirely learn to let go,MLeek
finding the baby voice unpleasant is a totally different opinion to express than asking her to silence or stop her affectionate text messages,MLeek
one is about style the other is about substance,MLeek
by all means give her notes on the style honestly the baby voice thing has just never been cute for me ive always found it a bit offputting but i wouldnt suggest you in the early days tell her that she should hold back on expressing her desire to be with you you dont seem to be describing bombarding here youre describing one text where she tells you she cares for you and misses you,MLeek
are you really that special that much a unique niche of an employment path really,MLeek
because i have a super niche path and career and i can still think of three people a few years younger than me who have made very very similar steps it never occurred to me to consider they were copying me we have similar goals and skill sets they are my professional colleagues not my mimics,MLeek
you are already doing the only thing you can do if this annoys you keeping the information you give him to a minimum besides that id advise you to get over yourself there is nothing to deal with except to decide if youre willing to put a positive word in when asked or not,MLeek
youre going to damage this relationship if you try to ask for payment for a gift youve already given to someone you say you basically consider a family member,MLeek
its as simple as that there is no magical way to demand payment now that wouldnt be hurtful they probably would accommodate you but it probably would damage the relationship because you handled the communication so poorly,MLeek
the time to revisit the could chuck us some money conversation from a place of respect was like february you missed your window by a mile,MLeek
i offered to pay for storage unit but the argument was why buy stuff if youre just going to store it but i like having rare sets to rebuild on occasion,MLeek
right so this is a thing to revisit as you take a deeper dive in your shared financial life,MLeek
but while doing so you need to recognize that while collecting or hoarding may serve a positive emotional need for you it may just as legitimately cause anxiety and distress in her to see more things piling up those are very real feelings you both have to be willing to acknowledge and address,MLeek
stop seeing this as a money problem and start seeing this as a feelings problem,MLeek
your gf doesnt feel secure with your shared saving plansgoals,MLeek
that is a problem worthy of addressing her feelings and opinions on that are fundamentally valid and worthy of your attention and time if you want to marry her you either need to increase those goalsplans or by help her gain more understanding of them so she can feel confident in the shared choices there are some financial advisors who specialize in helping couples have these conversations and building the emotional aspects of financial literacy,MLeek
the money isnt the core problem here the problem is that the money brings forward very different feelings in you both in order to build a life where she feels secure and you feel trusted and happy you need to come together to acknowledge and manage those feelings,MLeek
secondly and i could be wrong here but perhaps recognize that both of your nerdy hobbies dont just take up money they take up space collecting isnt just about money its about space and lifestyle she may genuinely dislike these hobbies but you still need to be reasonable enough to realize that a lego collection impacts her in ways sports tickets do not my ex was always on me about how i didnt respect his miniatures but i had no problem with him being nerdy and liking minis what i didnt like was the fact that he hoarded so many nerdy objects that my home was frequently uncomfortable and uninviting and he never parted with any of them accumulation without consideration was the issue not the money,MLeek
i dont care much for any of the people involved here and there is a lot of blame to go around but they were all responding to understandable stupid harmful pressures,MLeek
it does hit hard against that dichotomy want a happy life long marriage pick the adult woman you respect as an equal who really understands your goals and your values,MLeek
who is keeping the list,MLeek
today we are,MLeek
battery half of,MLeek
water,MLeek
the plot of the lion king or maybe just the villain arch the minions its a bit unclear,MLeek
please reread my post i suggest several avenues to bring these issues forward,MLeek
your bad feels are not the biggest issue here that the university can help you address  the issue here is he is not doing his job and he is not being respectful when he communicates with or about students,MLeek
you need to frame your issues in a way that makes it easier for the school to understand and address,MLeek
i would jus speak to your student ombudsperson directly to get clarity on what is expected of this helper and what your actual obligations to him are,MLeek
in the meantime block this mans number,MLeek
fundamentally there could be reasonable causes for an adult instructor to call an adult student in university the boundaries arent the same as they are in high school however without further instructions i think youre well within your own rights to withdraw consent from this particular person reaching out to your personal cell phone,MLeek
edit the fact you met with him for an extended period and none of your classes got book ie the outcome of the meeting wasnt achieved is actually probably your stronger objective complaint against him remember youre not just a student deserving of respect youre also a customer and this guy is giving you shitty service start with your ombudsperson or get advice from your student union even your program director is a another possible avenue but id get my ducks in a row before speaking with then,MLeek
i totally believed this happened you can pop cyst like this during sex or riding a bike or getting outta bed too fast but it was not for the reasons he thinks,MLeek
it is so fucking rare for husbands to show up at all when their wife is in hospital that any one who does a smidge more than drop off clean undies a magazine is treated like a god damn prince some nurses are as guilty of this shit as anyone,MLeek
so it wasnt about your dick ya dumbass you were getting wildly praised and rewarded for the baseline of care that woman are expected to provide without comment or complaint,MLeek
and if you can at all help if do not be sold off into a politically advantageous marriage while still a teenager to a man a decade older who is definitely not over his ex,MLeek
if these mens version of  a traditional woman requires that woman be in poverty and disempowered socially maybe there is something exploitative about wanting that kind of tradition,MLeek
how can you make it a nonissue that your husband is spiteful and doesnt listen to you or have any respect for your anxiety about money,MLeek
you cant not alone you feel rejected because you are being rejected and ignored not just misunderstood,MLeek
communication takes two people you cannot fix it entirely on your own the question you need to ask yourself right now is if you have a partner or not in solving this problem,MLeek
thats because shes bitter and hit the wall so they dont have to listen to her anymore s,MLeek
their system is flawless anyone who disagrees with them is always oldfatugly anyways,MLeek
dont try to jump the queue to become girlfriend by being friend with benefit that almost never works and it shouldnt you cannot be next in line for a relationship with someone,MLeek
if he wanted to date you he would he doesnt,MLeek
what youre considering would be harmful for you you dont want to be his fwb so dont agree to it only pretending to be an fwb while trying to wiggle your way into something more is dishonest and unkind either say no or admit to him what you really want,MLeek
youre arguing that you see the exact same percentage of women imagining the man in the service role is seriously flirting with them sure we cannot read minds we can read context like the context of someone being paid to be a pleasant sales associate or server,MLeek
because i spend a lot of time with women and while i have definitely heard a sales guy or bartender referred to as sucha flirt not a single woman i have met was confused about his role as a service provider,MLeek
there are plenty of errors that are just human but this one when it comes to flirting vs service is just not a 5050 cognitive error,MLeek
he told me that even watching porn when you have a boyfriend should be considered cheating so naturally i would assume that the same should apply to him,MLeek
if none of the other reasons cut it for you this one obviously should he shamed you and verbally abused you for far far less than he deliberately did behind your back and then he lied about it in the lamest possible way he thinks youre a moron,MLeek
whether or not you or i or he thinks this is cheating doesnt even matter it doesnt have to be cheating to be totally unacceptable dont get pulled into that argument with anyone this is all a very dangerous double standard from a man who is giving every signal he is willing to abuse you,MLeek
you dont owe him a conversation this isnt a debate this is him getting dumped for being dishonest and a dangerous partner keep yourself safe end it quickly and cleanly get rid of this man,MLeek
you are not completely innocent here because you violated the agreement when ella said she had caught feelings your responsibility was to say i understand but since that has happened i am no longer comfortable continuing with the sexual relationship,MLeek
youre not a monster but dont get attached is a hope its an intention its not a thing that can be promised it is not a boundary the boundary is if one of us catches feels we stop fucking,MLeek
so you had the exact same responsibility as ella had to end it when that happened  i would actually say you had the greater responsibility at that point since she had just told you that her motivations and judgements were clouded by her emotions and her attachment to you continuing to have sex with her at that point was selfish and naive your actions were not reflecting the agreement you said you wanted when you continued to meet up and have sex with ella after that conversation,MLeek
youre not a villain but you did fuck it up you had a clear line with ella at which all sexual connection should have ended and you both blew right past that line maybe not everything ella thinks of you now is reasonable but it was not kind you should have done better,MLeek
you need to just walk away,MLeek
he may be a lovely partner in some ways but he is absolutely not capable of offering you a relationship you should feel at all secure in and hes been dishonest from the beginning trying to manipulate you into accepting something he knew was a rather lousy offer,MLeek
this isnt a situation where everything is great except this this is him this is a guy who dove into dating while still fullon living with his ex gave totally false timelines introduced his kids way too early and has not been prioritizing his separation or creating a healthy home life for his kids,MLeek
this may be a good guy making shit choices but more likely its a rather shitty guy making rather shitty choices,MLeek
breaks are bullshit they are slowmotion breakups that just prolong the drama its time to be broken up tell him hes welcome to call you if he gets his act together and starts to actually live separately from his ex and has the time to date and be a coparent but dont hold your breath far more likely hell move on to another young thing he can manipulate into accepting this shitty situation for a few months,MLeek
its a neutral term  if you value your friends as friends what was their argument for misogyny that men didnt actually want her friendship so calling them that was offensive or a mislabel,MLeek
i think there can be a lot toxicity in fwbs situations because people forget to be friendly and end up viewing the other more like an amateur sex worker instead of buddy you share a fun activity with or they define down what would be objectively called casually dating into a fwbs situation but in my experience those issues are also pretty gender neutral men and woman both those mistakes,MLeek
hed never be so beta as to allow something like over a decade of data and welldocumented trends to penetrate his skull not when he saw with his own two eyes how the paid server smiled demurely at him not merely performing  her job in the expected style but clearly begging for the leadership and protection of a man,MLeek
there are cultural norms there are affects,MLeek
there is no more truth in his racist delusions about what those norms actually represent in individual human relationships then there is truth is his understanding of human biology,MLeek
ironically he did figure out anal tho,MLeek
and with a healthy dose of idiots not being able to tell the difference between customer service and women being super into them,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
this guy is telling you stories stories about how he think its permissible to treat others believe him,MLeek
he will turn around one of these days and declare you are just like all the others  and he will decide probably without telling you that he can treat you like the others then he will tell you youre not entitled to be hurt or angry with him because he warned you,MLeek
lots of people score a bit higher in sociopathic tendencies and recognize that means they need to work a little bit harder to empathize or to keep the ego in check people who struggle with this are pretty safe they compensate and focus on what healthy relationships really take people who say well this is just how i am and now you know fair warning are not,MLeek
you dont compromise,MLeek
you trust him so trust him to select his own friends and not hook up with strangers,MLeek
if you think he can be persuaded to cheat then you dont trust him and shouldnt date him  hes a 20 year old adult not an 8 eight year old on the playground being bullied into eating dirt or some shit if he doesnt want to cheat he wont,MLeek
emasculated is one of those toxic traps where the more you help him the more blame youll catch,MLeek
continue to be realistic most entry level jobs are easier to get when youre physically present there is little reason for someone to want to employ an 18 year old who cant start tomorrow thats usually the appeal of teenage employees,MLeek
besides that just listen agree that it does suck and it is disappointing  because it is that what it is not is a reflection on him as a man reminder him this has nothing to do with his gender  and even less to do with yours hes a person not a potential provider,MLeek
she didnt want to talk to a group of people who had said nasty things about her,MLeek
this is not rocket science youre being a weirdo who is making it all about sex when its about not talking to mean people who have insulted or shamed you previously if she has an ex who is a basically decent person or perfectly reasonable to not be nervous about him but to be nervous and want to avoid a group of bullies,MLeek
what went down with her made sense your reaction was intense and really strange you need to figure out what was going on inside your own head that led to this her explanations for what went on in her head pass the sniff test just fine,MLeek
its honestly terrifying where americans even ones who might consider themselves democrats think the centre is,MLeek
i remember back in the day trying to explain to a few american friends that obamas policies were not left of centre in any other established democracy very centrist even sometimes right of centre which was a large part of his global popularity,MLeek
but the far right nutters just saw a black man lost their shit completely and now here we all are,MLeek
shes not your problem its not her job to fix the issues in your relationship shes not your ally and youre not trying to help her out youre desperately trying to manipulate her into helping you out because you and your bf cannot find an agreement that works,MLeek
your problem is that you are choosing to stay in a relationship with someone you believe is cheating on you,MLeek
stop pretending to be worried about her wellbeing get a damn clue and realize youre the poor girl involved in this situation who isnt behaving in healthy ways or with any selfrespect,MLeek
if you cannot resolved this by speaking with him then it cannot be resolved,MLeek
stick to the no,MLeek
this was a rather transparent move on her part to force a meet with the children to justify her curiosity about you,MLeek
you and your bf have not decided to make a relationship with the children part of this relationship yet continue to not include the children in your plans when you do decide you are both ready for that step then you and she may need to meet briefly while custody is exchanged that is sufficient she gets to shake your hand not break bread with you,MLeek
whats best for the children is you declining as much as possible to play her game or become more a character in her little drama,MLeek
hes 22 he is not a boy he doesnt need to be handled hes not a toddler going through a phase where he find poop hilarious,MLeek
it is completely realistic to expect a 22 year old to be honest about their own interest in and opinions on porn use while in a relationship and to keep a promise if they make it,MLeek
men are people not dumb animals who cannot help themselves,MLeek
he doesnt agree with you about porn he never has he thinks its acceptable in a relationship,MLeek
if you want a relationship with someone who doesnt watch porn you need to date someone else,MLeek
if you want to stay with him youre going to have to find a way to deal with this as a legitimate and transparent disagreement instead of a hard boundary,MLeek
this man is too old to not understand that not everyone has a close or meaningful relationships with their parents and adult siblings,MLeek
and five months is quick for this kind of pressure and judgment,MLeek
what is weird is that he is not making the effort to listen to you and i understand who is actually important in your life,MLeek
as sad as it is if she needs to break up over this youd be wise to just accept that and wish her well,MLeek
she withheld information that was clearly relevant to her about her virginity and sexual experience for five years,MLeek
youre not the asshole she needs do the work herself to move past this if she is not willing or able to do that then you need to have the strength to face the end,MLeek
i wouldnt date this man,MLeek
hes telling stories about money mean untrue stories about you because of his choices about his money,MLeek
its one thing to be bad at budgeting but telling mean stories that its someone elses fault that youre spending what youre spending is a serious character flaw and one that will likely impact other areas of his life too itll be your fault he doesnt have enough free time your fault hes gaining weight your fault the house is cluttered with things your fault the grocery bill is too high,MLeek
be very very wary of signing up for a lifetime with someone who externalizes blame like this his gfwife will always be the most conveniently located external person to take the blame for his actions,MLeek
romantic intimacy not requiring a big budget is not your real core problem here,MLeek
this is shady and i wouldnt like it,MLeek
but his answer is plausible and im not surprised he tried to manage you this way,MLeek
this whole exchange was deeply immature on both sides,MLeek
talk to her as everyone is saying try some more actually relaxing games,MLeek
lots of gamers  men and women  think the golden rules change when they are gaming and that angry outbursts and namecalling are part of the culture you need to be able to say clearly that its not i love to game but ive had to have a few tough conversations with friends that if being able to yell or call people nasty names or throw things in anger is an important part of thier gaming experience  then they dont to game with me,MLeek
im an adult who likes to game if you are a gamer because you want to behave like a toddler sometimes please play with the other oversized toddlers,MLeek
it sounds like he feels he has done nothing wrong and broken no agreements with you,MLeek
he deleted the texts for six months,MLeek
he knew damn well he was violating the spirit of his exclusive relationship agreement with op even if he tries to claim he wasnt technically doing anything wrong trust doesnt work on technicalities trust was broken here,MLeek
why do you need to be the bigger person,MLeek
youre not holding on to the past youre addressing an ongoing issue with his choices,MLeek
he continues to bask in the attention of this woman who behaved inappropriately for months and who he only stopped enjoying the attention from when he got caught he knew he violating boundaries with these conversations  you know he knew because he was deleting the messages and telling her they were a problem but not telling her to stop it,MLeek
if a person who has a long history of ignoring my boundaries and flirting with me in direct disrespect of the relationship they know damn well im in climbs onto the treadmill beside mine i wrap up my workout and leave that person is not my friend,MLeek
it is reasonable to assume from this conversation hes at least quite aware of it and has seen some,MLeek
what you need to ask is if he engages with it regularly and thinks its acceptable porn consumption because you dont think its acceptable and you dont want to date someone who ever engages with it,MLeek
good luck with it  and with the therapy,MLeek
i think your boundaries are the right ones but your fears are a bit extreme and they are making this harder for your to deal with than it needs to be youre getting overworked and spun out and drawn to extreme cases you need to reign that in and realize your boundaries are important and valid even if watching this porn doesnt necessarily mean your bf is ever going to even look at an actual human child in that way once in his life its still not okay you dont have to be okay with it,MLeek
if you watch porn that features childrens bodies  even if they are illustrated  i cannot date you i feel too strongly that that is completely wrong to do i expect you to answer honestly is this porn you engage with and think is acceptable,MLeek
first you get into therapy you work on better managing your anxiety the odds of there being immediate risk or danger to anyone on this topic are rather low,MLeek
ethics in porn creation and consumption is important to me as well i would also draw the line with my partners if they were engaging with illustrated porn of prepubescent bodies its not acceptable to me even as fantasy even as an illustration to contextualize a childs body as a sexual object its a hard red line for me i wont date that person,MLeek
but like your cnc kink i would not assume that porn consumption meant pedophilic criminal behaviour was terribly likely just that i dont want to date someone who doesnt hold themselves to a higher standard when it comes to consuming pornography and framing their own sexual identity through what they consume,MLeek
youre going to need to revisit this conversation with him but i think you need some tactics to deal with anxiety before youre going to make it a productive one,MLeek
if hes testing you hes validationseeking and validation seeking is knowing how to communicate to get what you want its just a toxic way to go about it,MLeek
in the end you have to decide what you want in a relationship but if i was feeling i was having arguments multiple times a week after only two months i wouldnt be keen to continue either you need to be able to reframe these conversations and bring the temperature down or youre in for a hell of a lot of needless drama in my opinion,MLeek
if hes seeking attention and validation by picking petty fights with you thats pretty much the worst possible dynamic for someone who has a history of feeling smothered in relationships even if the other fights get resolved easily enough that would be a real concern to me i dont keep people around who use negative behaviours to try to get my attention,MLeek
if youre now in ldr after the move i absolutely wouldnt hold out much hope for it getting better,MLeek
this is two months this is you both on your best behaviour its not great,MLeek
i often joke that no one who lives in toronto drives in toronto we drive only to get out of toronto,MLeek
i owed a car for years and walked 45 mins to work on most days could i have driven it to it 10 mins on most days absolutely would it have been worth it absolutely not,MLeek
hah it really isnt but i do think were under a lot more construction downtown than ottawa is thats a lot of the dust in the downtown i have that experience every time i visit new york and the new yorkers are all like how do you like the big city and i think i know for a fact you can keep cities olders and wetter than this one cleaner than this one but its great,MLeek
youre unlikely to acquire the gf object to service your emotional needs like its a rare drop or legendary weapon or a partyplanner or a substitute mommy,MLeek
the older you get the more women are going to be turned off by this attitude towards them likewise your inability to form friendships with women you dont find sexually appealing always a bit of concern it means you are not able to value a woman as a person unless there is a chance they will be servicing your gf object requirements,MLeek
youve had a relatively normal amount of dating experience for an 18 year old thats not the problem the attitude is,MLeek
you need to fill your life better with or without a gf this dissatisfaction and any childhood drama is your job to address not the gf objects job build a life another person would actually want to share and be interested in and build relationships that arent based solely on getting your needs met but on equal exchange and mutual enjoyment,MLeek
play stupid games win stupid prizes,MLeek
some things are only fun as fantasies its okay to learn that,MLeek
also stop thinking about these potential thirds as if they arent real people with their own agency just because shes in an open relationship doesnt mean she had wanted to fuck the two of you,MLeek
keep the conversation shelved full stop it doesnt need to be more complicated than that just because someone seems convenient doesnt mean you should fuck them,MLeek
you put your foot down,MLeek
and if youre ready for a divorce go ahead with that and get a lawyer involved,MLeek
this is now crossed the line from him feeling whatever hes feeling to him acting in a way that is emotionally abusive,MLeek
the constant accusations of cheating without him willing to do anything to address his negative thoughts or behaviours or bad feelings is unacceptable it is abuse he needs to take some damn responsibility for himself and stop adding this issue entirely to your workload youre already doing plenty if he actually wants his feelings and concerns addressed he has to be part of the work to resolve this and not the abuser,MLeek
you cannot prove a negative you are know youre not cheating you know you dont the time in the day to cheat you cannot fix this for him you can recommend couples counselling but go in very cautiously because there is a real risk here that he wants to abuse you  that that is the point and not the accidental outcome here,MLeek
dont consent to cameras or to the invasion of your privacy until hes 100 committed to doing the work to get past his own bullshit if you do he will very very likely use this access to escalate his abuse not resolve it you seriously need to be considering your safety first and his feelings second,MLeek
the sad reality is very few 40 years old are choosing partners in their early 20s because they want an emotionally healthy relationship built on mutual respect possible but not likely,MLeek
and the stereotype is also sadly true he probably knows you dont have 10 mins in the day to cheat the most likely thing here is that he is projecting and is either cheating himself or wishing he was,MLeek
most relationships dont last forever,MLeek
but you dont stand a chance of noticing a good relationship when youve got one if you dont change these bad habits,MLeek
take a deep breath and see this for what it is this relationship isnt perfect this relationship might not last however if you want to give it the best shot to last or even to end on good terms you need to change your habits and find ways to manage your anxiety that should be the bulk of the work youre doing to maintain this,MLeek
thats nice,MLeek
hes naive dont take on his education,MLeek
consider this a learning experience you need to laugh at what you cannot and should not do anything about youre taking this too onto yourself,MLeek
sure,MLeek
but cities that dont prioritize walkability bike lanes and green spaces dont see those same benefits and then there is the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases from dense urban living which increases the risk of stroke heart disease lung cancer and asthma,MLeek
there is a lot of evidence that living in cities  especially welldesigned and governed ones  is a net win for individual human health but there is no reason to pretend there we are not making some trades offs and that really we need to make larger changes so people are able to be healthier regardless of the community they are living in,MLeek
you absolutely can tell her i wouldnt id go and enjoy her company  consider it a gift youre giving her  and id tell her later in a few days that im played out on tea and want to make a different tradition offer one or two other suggestions for a new event or activity you can do together on special days,MLeek
its not untrue its just framing the message in the least hurtful way sending her scrambling the day before is not terribly kind,MLeek
this is the answer dense urban environments dont have many health benefits but this is the one they do generally less time spent commuting and commuteserrands where walking is economical,MLeek
toronto is also exceptionally diverse  even in comparison to other major cities on the planet  so youre looking at a totally cornucopia of different eating habits and cultures around food,MLeek
if you drove out north to the small towns in ontario youd see a difference although broadly speaking canadians are slightly less obese than american counterparts probably a lot of reasons some just around portions sure but also i expect that better access to preventive medical care means we may get the heads up earlier if were at risk,MLeek
that doesnt change your responsbilty to this relationship,MLeek
your responsibility is to end it,MLeek
its not reasonable or kind to sit back and say well he hasnt left me yet so its his own damn fault hes still dating an addict its not all his fault you fully share the blame when you allow a relationship to continue where you know for a fact you are not offering them what they say they need,MLeek
youve already made it clear youre not going to accept this ultimatum,MLeek
which means you must end the relationship nothing else is acceptable,MLeek
yes the relationship should end if you dont want to abandon your lifestyle of using,MLeek
its really not any more complicated than that youre not dedicated to your sobriety he wants a sober partner its time for one of you to end this,MLeek
its not all on him its your job too dont encourage him to leave walk away because you are not offering him what he has told you he needs this is on you stop trying to make it all his job to leave you he should but youre just as responsible for the end as he is,MLeek
extremely skewed this is a relationship your wife has formed its not a mechanic for humans,MLeek
im concerned you continue to gloss over the fact you are eavesdropping that needs to stop completely and forever the only information you are privy to about her therapy is the information she shares with you,MLeek
youre missing mine,MLeek
there is no situation in which is acceptable for you to sit and listen to your wifes therapy like this without both her permission and the therapists,MLeek
you describing hearing way to much and forming far too deep an opinion for it to be accidental and even if you insist this was accident you dont appear to realize it cannot happen again,MLeek
we dont know the therapist sucks right now neither do you we do know you are not holding yourself to an appropriate standard when it comes to your wifes privacy because you have told us you are not,MLeek
this is staggeringly inappropriate and disrespectful why do think this is an okay way for you to behave do you sit beside her at every dental cleaning to hear what the dentist says read all of her emails examine her shit before shes allowed to flush,MLeek
you need to quit this,MLeek
you do not know what is going on with your wife but i dont know what is going on with you but you have some of your own shit to figure out here this is not cool,MLeek
hit the breaks hard and put these assumptions aside,MLeek
and absolutely stop eavesdropping leave the house if you cant help but overhear shit that shouldnt even need to be said,MLeek
you dont know what goes on in that room your envisioning is counterproductive and unhelpful,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely the therapist drastically changed their approach unless your wife askedindicated they do so,MLeek
what is far far more likely is your wife changed what she is listening to and how she is engaging with the therapy,MLeek
instead ask your wife pointed questions about what tools she was recommended for this situation encourage her to ask her therapist for tactics or techniques focus on how that approach was initially helpful to her in the early stages her time was not a waste you saw the things of value she was getting out of it previously,MLeek
finally recognize that a therapist saying yes that is difficult and yes that does suck is perfectly valid and helpful and that your wife was entitled to change how she engaged with therapy,MLeek
you cannot manage your way out of every stressor and difficulty in life sometimes shit just sucks for a while dont assume your wife needs to be further fixed or just has to do better that sounds to me like a bit of toxicity positivity sneaking in what she might actually need from you as well at the moment is just the validation that yes this is hard hard things are hard sometimes there isnt much better to be had or to be done and we just live through the hard bits,MLeek
just decline the future plans if you want to continue to rebuild a relationship with olivia invite her to oneonone things and not double dates,MLeek
i wouldnt inform her unless she asked,MLeek
this is what a responsible civil defence looks like when the accused is definitely guilty of way way worse than the issue at hand,MLeek
they just need the court to put a  on this one so they can go home without admitting to something thatll get him more than a fine,MLeek
yeah dont do it,MLeek
just tell her youre really happy for her but you have confirmed to attend an engagement party now and arent able to make it at that time,MLeek
try to book another time to see her in the near future  maybe make some nice oneonone time planned with her during your mothers day trip,MLeek
you can also tell her that while she may be ready to forgive her bf youre fed up with him treating your sister like dirt and will be minimizing the time you spend near him,MLeek
this is manipulation while it is true that anyone can and should leave a marriage that isnt working when someone is constantly holding a gun to the head of the relationship threatening to shoot if they dont get everything they want then youre not in a partnership anymore youre in a hostage situation,MLeek
dont tolerate the word divorce being thrown around lightly if he says he wants a divorce tell him he is welcome to one  if he wants out you want him to get out  but he is not welcome to constantly threaten you with one just to get his way,MLeek
tell him it doesnt matter if its love or lust its unwelcome,MLeek
this is boundarybusting unwelcome behavior if he wants to respect your marriage and respect you as an individual then you expect him to respect you right now when you ask him to quit this permanently,MLeek
if he doesnt immediately correct himself or if he begs or bargains or tries to say youve just misunderstood then he values his idea being in love but not lust with you over his actual friendship with the human being you actually are in which case get rid of him,MLeek
own your own shit,MLeek
i would appreciate it if youd get a checkup i dont want to keep talking about the maybes i care about you and it would make me feel more secure to know,MLeek
he may still say no but at least youll have been honest about what you are actually feeling and not beating around the bush trying to make him feel the same way you do,MLeek
yeah no,MLeek
im sticking with my reasonable assumption that he is making the purchase and they are paying him back the comment above refers to them still needing to pay him back even if they couldnt go because they are not refundable,MLeek
hes the one with the membership so hes making the purchase to get a better rate hes tasked with buying the tickets they are paying him back for their share,MLeek
this op would be very very clear if he was the one paying for all three of them each time hes not gonna let that be unclear if he was gifting his buddies to a trip to the movies once a month,MLeek
probably and if it was him going about his previous plans is the best way to deny her the control and not let this tactic work,MLeek
i mean i wouldnt want to date someone i suspected of that but short of breaking up that is his only option its not like he can force her to go to work,MLeek
it may be petty to force a verbal agreement i actually like usqitten suggestion here way more than mine do that,MLeek
listen to upurveyorofsocks this is not how socks are to be purveyed,MLeek
i dont want to turn this in to a family vacation to serve my own needs,MLeek
okay but consider how that conversation was from her perspective that is exactly what it seemed you were trying to achieve even though some of the boys werent free anyways that would be a very reasonable pov for her to have here she planned x trip with her and one son and friends and you tried to turn it into y whole family trip you said y was important and how you wanted to spend the money then you didnt answer but im assuming here you did nothing else about actually making y happen but remain quietly upset and asked no further questions about her plans for x,MLeek
look shes not here to give advice too id be telling her to validate your feelings and recognize the important of shared meaningful activities but youre the one here and youre fighting the wrong battle and not working for or planning or advocating for the family vacation you told her you valued,MLeek
take it to the counsellor if you need help getting back on track,MLeek
he should be ashamed for leaving cum socks shoved in the couch cushions,MLeek
if he is feeling shame he is responding like a rational person to be caught out being an inconsiderate slob dont let him pretend hes so stupid that he didnt know this wasnt respectful behaviour in shared spaces,MLeek
you already apologized for making jokes and making light of the situation you can repeat that if youd like however his behaviour does need to change you being insensitive doesnt mean he gets to shove x many more socks into the couch you both know that,MLeek
youve got other issues in your relationship that got pulled into this fight acknowledge that say it out loud you know youre both frustrated about other things as well when it comes to sex but for this very specific subject youd like him to agree there will be no more cum socks shoved in the couch cushions,MLeek
and what did she say about the idea of also planning a family vacation with you and the rest of the kids have you taken any steps yourself or put any of your energy into this or suggested any possible future plans on this,MLeek
if you want to plan something as a couple or a family vacation then you should do that and advocate for that with her but you can value that and your time together as a family without going on the attack with other plans she might also value especially if cost isnt a key issue here,MLeek
trying to turn something which someone else invited her and one son on into a family vacation to serve your emotional needs when some of the other kids arent even free to go anyways was not a great move your feelings are valid but that doesnt mean every single way you may handle them is particularly wise,MLeek
i think you reacted from a really emotional place understandable but not entirely fair and her response was predictable if she had wanted you to come she had the opportunity to frame it that way she wanted it to be okay that youre not included,MLeek
you need to back this way up valuing having a family vacation is just dandy only deciding you value that because you felt left out in this case and dont like this plan is hurtful,MLeek
hes a mooch,MLeek
38yearold men arent this stupid unless its a useful tactic,MLeek
invite him to prioritize himself fully you look for someone who treats you like a partner not a nicer place to crash for free than mommies,MLeek
no kiddo it isnt gay people are plenty capable of being sexist racsit andor homophobic assholes and while no one can stop you people are gonna call you an asshole thats the consequence of being an asshole,MLeek
on the amazingly slim chance youre not just a troll its good your friend knew you well enough not to bother having this pointless argument with your selfabsord ass,MLeek
this might point to a more basic inability to communicate like ive said its not work you can do alone its a job you have to be a fully committed part of but if she cannot do her part as well it doesnt resolve and then youre just both get stuck in a place where youre just not compatible,MLeek
good luck with it,MLeek
right the joke is that you think other gay men lack selfrespect and that they choices they make for themselves are rude selfabsorbed and just stereotypes,MLeek
and you think that is totally funny and not at all judgemental or homophobic,MLeek
like we cannot stop you from thinking that but its boneheaded and wrong and if i hung out with you id be saying yuck that that pile of bullshit,MLeek
so whats the joke exactly,MLeek
is the joke that other gay men are too feminine to hang with the boys that they are too flirty too sexually aggressive too woke too annoying,MLeek
what makes the other gay men one of the bad ones and you not one of those,MLeek
cause i think when you try to explain that you might realize when its not really all that funny id never describe myself as one of the good bisexuals because most bisexuals are fantastic and assholes can be assholes because they are assholes not because they are bi,MLeek
does he where,MLeek
theyre nonrefundable paul and mike said they wouldnt mind paying their share anyway but i bet they wouldnt like it if it actually happened,MLeek
the anyways in there certainly implies they regularly pay him back for the tickets he books for the group,MLeek
youre in the wrong for believing this person is a good partner for you,MLeek
even if he started out with this kind of pigheadedness its been a year and a half and hes developed zero respect or appreciation for what you study and do thats an even bigger issue in my opinion than the compatibility one,MLeek
that doesnt really address more than a few words of what i actually said,MLeek
there were emotions at play here that you steamrolled over and left your gf feeling less connected and valued,MLeek
you dont need to buy her takeaway to be nice but sheesh could you really not figure out how to be any nicer than this,MLeek
you both kinda suck today,MLeek
she should have respected the first no but you sound like youre nickelanddiming her when she feels unwell and im not surprised she felt hurt by that likewise im not sure why she wouldnt have offered to order for you both,MLeek
you do need to be open to joining your partner in small things that bring that joy sometimes maybe this wasnt the time but there do need to be times or even the most budgetconscious of partners may end up feeling pushed away and unloved,MLeek
im not going to pretend i respond as well as i should to criticism but i would rather be told whats up rather than be blissfully ignorant of her pain i dont try to make it so she cant tell me things and i dont understand why she feels that way,MLeek
you see the contradiction there right you know you could do better but dont want to understand why she might feel like you should do better,MLeek
im not trying to call you a monster i think this is an important lesson about dealing with conflict with someone you love,MLeek
the change is you have to be actively trying to make it easier for her to come to you with negative messages you both need that from each other and that is hard work for you both it seems to be a trust that is missing here you cannot fix this alone  shell have to put the work in too  but you absolutely can ruin it on your own and you can damage that trust super quick with just a few careless words or assumptions,MLeek
i think the important thing to recognize is when said things were going well she was probably not actually lying she was telling you the best truth she had available to her at the moment or she might have been rounding it up and focusing on the emotional connection and intimacy instead of her orgasm those arent malicious lies those are choices she was making to try and emphazies the important elements that were totally present for her and not to focus too much on the ones that werent,MLeek
most people dont try to lie to the ones they care about most people tell the truth they have at the moment they have it and on reflection realize there are also other important truths they need to express,MLeek
your first step may be as simple as saying i realize my responses might not be making you feel safe to bring these things to me and that isnt what i want for us im going to work on that because i really need you to come to me with these things,MLeek
you take a huge step back and instead of calling her a liar and blaming her for all the totally valid reasons she was ashamed or afraid of speaking up earlier you make a safe space and show you are someone she can talk to by saying ok im listening now in order for this to work you have to be able to trust me even if im not into something we can talk about it,MLeek
i understand youre hurting but so is she and she probably has been for a while,MLeek
youre not going to make this better by centring your bruised ego and accusing her of malice when she was genuinely trying to do the right thing by protecting that ego and placing your sexual pleasure above her own,MLeek
she made a mistake an understandable human mistake,MLeek
the two of you are now fighting a lifetime of sexual shame and conditioning and possibly even ignorance youre not going to win that fight with more shame and blame and accusations all that response tells her is that she was right that should have kept on protecting your ego or youll get mad with her you gotta be the bigger person here or nothing good happens,MLeek
equally valuable yes,MLeek
equally accessible not always,MLeek
recognize that some of your wifes hobby also checks required labour boxes like some basic home maintenance and child enrichment activities so while your desired activity is checking only one box relaxationrecharge she is multitasking its not unusual for some productive hobbies to get a larger share of time just because they achieve other goals simultaneously ie someone who loves to cook or bake might spend more time at the activity but there was still a baseline of time required to that activity to begin with,MLeek
other hobbies can be prohibitively expensive or require getting a group together for extended periods and for that reason get far fewer hours really dedicated to them,MLeek
equally valuable and worthy of respect is not necessarily the same getting equal hours in the week dedicated to them,MLeek
if you need more downtime ask for it clearly and carve it out but i think tying to fight for if you spend x hours in your garden then i get x hours to veg out is really missing the point entirely and setting up a false comparison where you are going to come out looking petty and foolish even if you are expressing totally valid need for more relaxing time that need should be respected equally but it doesnt necessarily mean the same number of hours should be booked off,MLeek
it sounds like a core incompataiblity,MLeek
if by recent you mean a few weeks then perhaps allow a bit more time for her to sit with the idea and consider it,MLeek
but if by recent you mean a few months of dating then shes not responding from a place of surprise or having never considered this at all shes just telling you straight up she values being closer to her family and youre not compatible,MLeek
you need to date closer to home people with established lives are unlikely to move just for a relationship for most people there need to be other motivators as well bringing them to your area to make this successful,MLeek
youre telling these guys they arent worth a 20 nonrefundable risk once per month,MLeek
they are gonna find that hurtful and your refusal to commit earlier for better seats as disrespectful and thats valid they are your plan b youre making that totally clear,MLeek
maintaining healthy relationships involves some cost and some compromise if youre not willing to eat this cost or manage this compromise then youre probably gonna damage these friendships and you might not maintain this connection its not complicated its something you have to decide and you have to address,MLeek
there is no magic spell that makes them 100 okay with what you want what you want is hurtful and not respectful of what they value if you cannot find a compromise or accept a risk then you need to optout and join in a separate seatorder once youre ready to buy thats the nonasshole approach,MLeek
dude suggest someone else manage the purchase if your priorities and planning dont fit with the groups preferences and needs,MLeek
be gracious be a grownup its not disrespectful to have your own system it is disrespectful not to be open to change when they say its not working for them address the feelings and the issue in the obvious way youre not the right one of the three of you to be buying the tickets maybe someone else should do it,MLeek
the judgment youre heaping on them for just being different people with different preferences and priorities than you is just really petty and meanspirited,MLeek
the point of the thing is to not be an asshole with people in your life you want to keep in your life,MLeek
you are treating them like plan b and thats fine but stop getting your knickers in a knot because they have the audacity to know that youre treating them like plan b,MLeek
hand over the responsibility of booking the tickets and maybe the transfer of the account itself if youre a real mensch to someone else and accept that if you get a better offer some friday and cancel on them you might be the one out the cost of your movie ticket if you hold steady on this youre torching your friendship and disrespecting something they really value over the possible cost of a few movie tickets a year on your end,MLeek
i mean i think its a bit embarrassing when 40yearolds use ig as a public record of their spank bank to be perfectly honest,MLeek
but the insecurities issues are your own speak to your therapist about those,MLeek
if youre not going to request different boundaries on socials from your partner which you could certainly do and they could say yes or no then dont go looking for things you know will only make you unhappy exercise some selfcontrol and keep working with your therapist,MLeek
you dont want to spend time with her this week you didnt plan to you dont want to it doesnt just seem that way it is that way and that needs to be okay,MLeek
stop accusing her of malice if on some level she did do this to get more time together then simply make that plan fail spend your time as you planned too take a walk or a ride on your own meet up with a friend encourage and agree with her that she needs to manage her mental health the way she thinks is best  and largely leave her to it  just because youre not at work doesnt mean you are available as a caregiver at all times,MLeek
youre being immature and petty the only difference between these situations is your ego was the one bruised this time and your motivated reasoning to define it as somehow a bigger betrayal but your choices were innocent its total bullshit and you ought to know it,MLeek
if you want to be with her actually with her stop being a chicken shit and do the work stop stringing her along stop allowing yourself to be strung along either be together now both of you stop pressuring others in any way or dont,MLeek
no one else can tell you what choice to make or promise you itll work out but the obvious glaring problem here is that you two keep stalling out on the road to a relationship shit or get off the pot,MLeek
you are 19 it might suck but you need to do better than this even if you were paying her rent youd still owe another human being in the house youre staying in a bit better than what youve expressed here,MLeek
boundaries are good assumptions shes trying to control or manipulate you  without any evidence  are harmful to everyone involved including yourself,MLeek
frankly your mom comes across here as even more toxic than the new gf,MLeek
i understand being uncomfortable and having boundaries but you also need to realize that you have the power to decide not to feel guilty or obligated you have the ability to accept a gift like a young adult and acknowledge when nothing but basic friendliness is expected in return,MLeek
in the future if you feel this strongly about rent you need to make the agreement about rent before you arrive once youre there if she says youre a guest and you dont need to pay there isnt much you can about it maybe buy the three of you takeout once a week as a way to acknowledge and thank them,MLeek
until and unless this woman actually does try to hold her gifts against you find a damn bit of chill that doesnt mean accepting everything she offers but it does mean acting like an adult house guest and not an angry adolescent who isnt getting their way,MLeek
no store should be telling a total stranger about another customers purchases or habits but sending them photos and asking them to ban her is just silly you may embarass her out of it but did you really think a bookstore is gonna refuse her money,MLeek
this woman might be annoying and you should keep doing the dishes and keep your eyes open for other ways to contribute to the household but you also need to take it down like 9 notches and stop assuming malice just because your mom has her knickers in a bunch,MLeek
this makes me wonder if your bf believes that all familial relationships are basically womans work and that you should just be making this perfect for him without him needing to do anything at all,MLeek
my ex and his family was like this just a few months into dating they found it appalling that i picked up a mothers day card for my own mom but didnt get one for his mom who i had met once basically they were fine with him forgetting birthdays and events when he was single  just a man cant be helped  but as soon as he had a gf they all assumed it was the gfs job to keep track of these things,MLeek
youre not at all crazy i dont know what the red flags were but assuming you were not telling nasty lies about him then you made a very normal human mistake and most healthy people understand that ventinganxiety in a new relationship isnt the same as the relationship being all bad or toxic your family has given every sign of understanding that,MLeek
so for him now the simple answer is yes,MLeek
yes i am holding you accountable for your current choices to reject my familys invitations and opportunities to build a relationship with them yup i am putting the responsibility for your current choices the ones you are making today on you,MLeek
hes entitled to his feelings it may be awkward or uncomfortable at times but fundamentally what this guy is telling you is that youre not worth it your family and your family events arent worth him putting in the work or really any work to move this situation forward,MLeek
at this point you have to acknowledge he may not want this fixed not really he may just enjoy his blanket excuse to opt out of any adult responsibilities towards your family and nothing short of treating him like king charles will be considered acceptably friendly to meet his standards,MLeek
your bf is being extremely weird and i suspect he doesnt want this fixed on some level hes enjoying lording it over you,MLeek
its not all normal to expect your adults gfs family to text you or call you to chat,MLeek
he is invited that is how your family is welcoming and its appropriate hes invited and hes refusing to go because its not good enough that is childish to say the least,MLeek
youve done what you need to do it,MLeek
your family is inviting him in,MLeek
it is his responsibility to show up and be himself a nice version of himself,MLeek
that is literally all he has to do and hes refusing to do it,MLeek
you made a mistake years ago but everyone involved besides him is being reasonable about it and ready and willing to move past it with just a tiny bit of effort required,MLeek
its becoming another and very real red flag that he is not willing to show up for you and do his part,MLeek
there is no shame in being a bit thirsty but save yourself some drama and dont be shocked when a 20something hookup behaves like a 20something hookup,MLeek
one of the benefits of being in your 30s is supposed to be not getting so hung up on this bullshit anymore if you want to sleep with him tell him so and invite him over ya want to date him tell him so and suggest a date not half as complicated as youre making it,MLeek
eh your mother doesnt have high standards shes bigoted and biased and stigmatizes mental illness and divorce who says broken family is 2023 a family changes often for the better after a separation of unhappy adults,MLeek
id much rather date an adult who sought treatment for mental health issues and is now stable than an adult who never admitted they needed help it can cause issues but most of those issues arise from the refusal to seek treatment and acknowledge the problem if he took the right steps and is stable now i wouldnt be concerned,MLeek
thank your mother for her concern then follow your own judgment,MLeek
you need to walk away,MLeek
either she is too immature and unstable to offer you a healthy relationship or she is actually abusive and using these threats as a tactic to get the behaviour she wants out of you to keep you insecure and chasing her approval,MLeek
frankly it sounds like its the latter she is doing this just to maintain control and keep you too scarred to ever ask for or expect better for yourself,MLeek
but either way its not a relationship you should stay in,MLeek
two things you need to accept,MLeek
1 this isnt the life you want hes not offering you what you need and you do need a partner who isnt an active addict,MLeek
2 you dont know hed be a good partner otherwise thats a fantasy and a hope not a knowable thing,MLeek
youre gambling with your life and its a bet that might not pay out even if he does get sober which he is not doing,MLeek
not your circus not your monkeys,MLeek
you said your piece and im sure you meant well  at first,MLeek
now its time to stop badgering these adults with your opinions and judgments they are doing just fine you need to handle yourself,MLeek
three months in and hes dismissive and unable to handle conflict,MLeek
this wasnt just about your issues this is about his issues he may not have consciously weaponized your vulnerability but he used it to avoid addressing his own shit or his own inadequacies,MLeek
dont overthink it it was three months a perfectly normal amount of time to really like someone but realize they arent offering what you need in a partner,MLeek
each couple gets to decide,MLeek
but practically speaking if you are legally married then your money is combined in many ways  even if you have no insight into it,MLeek
asking for some exact  of change on one day seems entirely beside the point and not really all the helpful information unless hes selling today at some sort of major profit its not really information that means much,MLeek
however asking for enough transparency and knowledge so you could take care of both peoples financials if they were in a coma for six months thats my rule of thumb i have never combined finances but we have shared retirement goals we update one another on at least one a year and we make sure the other person knows enough about our accountsinsurancedebtetc to that if one of us was in a coma for six months what needs to get taken care of would get taken care of,MLeek
the fact youre feeling insecure and uncertain about your future is a problem that needs to be addressed,MLeek
if you dont want to date someone whose ex is also a close childhood friend stop dating that person,MLeek
youre giving this guy way too much power hes not an evil mindcontrol wizard if his existence was an issue in the past it was an issue for one or both of you he didnt make the relationship spoiled you two didnt maintain it,MLeek
youve told her  with your actions  that you cannot be trusted to respond reasonably to her friendship with this person not even in a group setting so now she hides that friendship and her choices because she doesnt enjoy how you treat her when you are met with that reality shes not unhappy with her boundaries shes unhappy with your behaviour,MLeek
if you need her to observe different boundaries you can ask for them clearly trying to shame her into doing what you want by saying shes not respecting herself is gross if that is what you think of her dont date her,MLeek
people who pressure you are asshats,MLeek
i didnt drink from 19 to about 26 having fun with people who are drinking is definitely a skill and a practice i never felt like i was missing out on being wild because it was actually the loss of control i didnt enjoy but i definitely felt less interesting or plain its hard to remember that they are the ones being irrationally confident  youre fine,MLeek
to hide among the drinkers id ask for a coke is a short glass and people assumed my drink was a rum and coke its a pricy way to fake it but in groups where i didnt feel like explaining myself it works,MLeek
people who arent asshats arent really thinking about you at all,MLeek
yes it was terrible that partners urgent care and months in hospital costs us less than 2k outta pocket and we are  both now back at work as a productive and healthy members of the community instead of me being broke or even homeless and him being dead,MLeek
also hate my basic physical autonomy as a person who may experience an unwanted pregnancy some day,MLeek
some will and hell be peddling male supplements and prepper supplies to make ends met like alex jones if his do not compete allows it,MLeek
tucker was bad habit tv most people will replace the habit they will get their hit but they arent necessarily loyal to tucker theyll be asking their friends where they get theirs now that the guy with good stuff is doing 2 years in federal same as any addict,MLeek
it really just sounds like hes listing the ways a lot of men loss a lot of money,MLeek
the amount the guys i know lost on crypto put my scented candle collection to shame theyd have been better off scrolling instagram,MLeek
this is rude and inconsiderate behaviour of those around you,MLeek
given your age there is a risk someone will say something nasty to you and nastier to her for letting you,MLeek
i would suggest you keep sexual touching private you know this touching is sexual thats why youre enjoying it so keep it private,MLeek
i honestly dont understand,MLeek
no one involved here seems to think anything happened except that she invited an old friend and a friend of a friend to a different public gathering of many friends,MLeek
all that i can see here that might have happened is your dude friend wanted to stir up some misery and drama in your life and found a super lame and weak excuse to do so which shamed you into a breakup,MLeek
after two years i wouldnt assume my gf wanted to fuck someone else just because she invited him to an afterparty its weird you seemed to however if that is what you thought then its best to be broken up,MLeek
being upset isnt getting you anywhere you need to start to be very clear about when you will be prioritizing your own family  even without him  and when you would like him to put his phone down and be present with you,MLeek
youve allowed a dynamic to form in this relationship that you are not happy with you need to tell him plainly its not okay and its going to be renegotiated you will be spending your time a bit differently and he will be expected to be respectful of that,MLeek
dating is really hard work its worse than finding a job it sucks,MLeek
but you did have really good dates that is what happened and its what should happen if youre mature and selfaware you should have mostly good dates but good isnt good enough to build a lifetime of romance and compatibility on and that is okay most good dates after two or three of them are gonna result in one of you saying eh youre good people but youre not my person,MLeek
if youre having largely good dates thats perfect thats really great thats what you want if you were mostly having totally shitty and disappointing dates then youd need to seriously reevalute your choices,MLeek
all you need to do here is realize its work its hard work it is often disappointing work it takes a shit ton of time outta your day if you are really burnt out on the work take a pause for a few months and then come back to it resilience is the name of the game for you resilience and remembering that good doesnt have to be good enough not for them and not for you,MLeek
ill take you one further employees and clients do this schoolchildren do this human beings do this its a normal part of human relationships forming sex and love isnt the only place were looking for compatibility and understanding of boundariesterms the engagement,MLeek
i have never shited tested on purpose but ive had two guys accuse me of it and they were both totally own goals,MLeek
one i asked plainly about his views on abortion mine were right up front in my profile and i dont date men who disagree with me on this subject and he refused to answer because it was a shittest so i unmatched and moved on,MLeek
then i had another guy accuse me of shittesting once because he suggested a restaurant where i had previously had an allergic reaction so i suggested another nearby and very similar where i could eat more comfortably,MLeek
he absolutely went off on me about shittesting him and gameplaying if it hadnt been so spooked by it itd have been really funny my only intention was to have a pleasant meal i could enjoy,MLeek
both cases they created shittests out of normal direct human communication by failing so utterly,MLeek
then im with udfahnz,MLeek
i dont know why youre trying to force this after three months,MLeek
youre calling her controlling demanding and unkind and thinking she cantwont change these patterns if your assumptions are unfair  you shouldnt date her anymore anyways if your beliefs are bang on  you definitely shouldnt date her anymore,MLeek
youve had fun for three months but that was casual intellectual fun i wonder if you are a bit more attracted to the idea of the clever concert pianist then the actual woman who is there the life you actually want to live daytoday does not sound like its going to be with her,MLeek
edit it always depends on the dog and the situational trigger but definitely make sure you encourage other adults who visit your home to help you by immediately becoming unfun if the dog jumps on them any big reaction positive or negative reinforce the behaviour if the dog is smart enough to know the behaviour is undesirable you start rewarding them for better choices ie a greeting that takes place on all fours or a good back up or off if youre really struggling get a pro involved,MLeek
first things first the dog shouldnt be jumping on anyone that actually is a training situation where perfection is the fair expectation its up there with no biting one dog lover to another you need to step up your game the expectation of not being jumping is not excessively demanding or controlling  especially not if you two want to be parents with this dog in the household  and is one you should be working seriously to meet by the time the dog is a year old very very few of my dogs were still jumping with any frequency by 1 year old,MLeek
the second thing is you dont actually sound as independent and confident as you think you are,MLeek
you sound like youre taking good advicefeedbackexpectations when she gives that but call it demanding when you dont like it instead of saying youre a smart woman but no thats ones not for me thanks,MLeek
the fact the dog kept her up is a problem a problem that should be solved by a simple im sorry the dog kept you up i understand that was really unpleasant for you itll happen sometimes but we do need to minimize it next time please wake me up so i can handle the situation and we can all get back to sleep,MLeek
i think you need to step back and realize your girlfriends directness and transparency can be a good thing when you meet it with equal transparency confidence selfknowledge and directness,MLeek
maybe she is a deeply toxic and unkind person trying to change you maybe shes abusive i really cannot tell what i can see here is that you take what is useful to you and get quietly pissed with her for what you dont like and try to force yourself to accept it you also need to learn to take the good with the bad and stand up for yourself clearly when you disagree with her that is when you will know if shes just a forceful person with decent conflict resolution skills or an abusive bully,MLeek
at 3 months you probably also want to have some of the tougher conversations about what life together would look like you want a dog for the rest of your life they are a member of the family as much as a child be clear that that dog wont be rehome for any reason except extremely and immediate safety situations ie the dog starts mauling people youre 39 you should also think of some of the other dealbreakers its time to discuss plainly like plans and values around money or homeownership or faith and family,MLeek
you can mute the chat or leave it and tell them why,MLeek
its just not a positive and healthy space for you right now it may be what they need but its exactly what you need to take some space from they arent doing anything terribly wrong you just need to stand up and leave the frontrow seat of a show youre not enjoying,MLeek
ask them to reach out to you via other channels when they want to get together and thank them for their support and understanding,MLeek
you need to be willing to take care of yourself no one else is gonna read your mind and do it for you,MLeek
i agree we dont need their language or framing,MLeek
we have a lot of healthier genderneutral words this phase of a human relationship where boundaries are tested and we figure out another out storming doubt stage hide and seek stage the power struggle the honeymoon hangover,MLeek
and men do it plenty im dealing with a new hire who cannot string 10 words together with shittesting his coworkers or managers either were going to move through this phrase or were gonna dissolve the relationship this isnt evil women this is a normal social strategy you can observe in a kindergarten classroom,MLeek
the way the puaincel defines shit testing is inherently malicious and immature and only assigned to women but in reality its a normal part of human relationships forming even in the workplace and its can be benign or even helpful,MLeek
hes abusive,MLeek
when someone says you make me be cruel there is no grey zone that is the battle cry of the unrepentant abuser,MLeek
he feels entitled to call you nasty names if he uses the threat of breaking up each time hes not getting his way that is also a common abuse tactic this will not get better and might get worse,MLeek
you explained fine he choose to doubledown on accusing you these kinds of misunderstandings are frequent in relationships its a red flag when a man of 30 cannot handle them without making absolute absurd accusations,MLeek
tell him that is not fair or true if he cannot accept misunderstandings with a bit of grace and respect you shouldnt be wasting your time with him,MLeek
either he is terribly immature or this is a tactic hes using to keep you proving yourself and feeling insecure in the relationship either way you should expect better,MLeek
your bf knows how he treats other women at parties he assumes all men do the same,MLeek
this isnt just the controlling hypocrisy of it its also him telling on himself he knows how he behaves is wrong but feels entitled to it,MLeek
dont dare someone who feels entitled to behave badly,MLeek
you cant fix a person with poly it requires even more open discussion about boundaries and comfort not less someone who busts boundaries and neglects their partners feelings and doesnt communicate openly in a monogamous relationship isnt gonna suddenly start doing those things right in a poly on,MLeek
i think you need to have a serious think about what youre trying to fix in this relationship,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
let it go,MLeek
you didnt go any further than they did,MLeek
tell your husband that being a bit embarrassed or uncomfortable is totally understandable  just like you were  but if you can have a laugh about it surely he can as well,MLeek
if hed like to discuss how you can both observe different boundaries about privacy and sex in the future thats great have that conversation about what is off limits,MLeek
youre not concerned that your bf tried to negotiate a polyeqsue situation with another woman staying in your home without talking to you first because thats a bad start,MLeek
there are reddits specifically for polyamory and nonmonogamy and you might get more advice there but i have had openenm relationships most of my life and frankly the way your bf behaved with you and with a vulnerable woman staying in your home does not sound the least bit ethical i wouldnt offer a person anything if they tried to create a threesome or more  without talking to me their partner first,MLeek
it sounds like youre trying to manage a man who you know will cheat on you thats never a good place to come at this from,MLeek
its a fairly common fantasy that fuels a huge percentage of the science fiction and fantasy stories we have,MLeek
can you explain a bit more about what makes you uncomfortable about these conversations does she want to do harm to certain kinds of people does she not listen to feedback or is pushy with her friends about her imagined authority,MLeek
if she is basically expressing impossible wishes for the world to be kinder or safer for other people  and doesnt see that happening  i think shes probably just at an immature stage of a social justice conscience and i really wouldnt worry about it,MLeek
certainly have a back up plan in place,MLeek
this man is controlling and abusive he may also have a very genuine sensitivity but the way hes addressing it is not acceptable,MLeek
i would suggest you tell the wife you will no longer be cooking its not comfortable or reasonable for you to feel like youre taking a risk each time you feed the children its cannot be your responsibility if this is the behaviour that is going on in the home,MLeek
i wouldnt be willing to stay till september but if you do definitely have a back of plan of a quick safe place to stay this is a pretty toxic situation and you want to be able to leave quickly if needed you should not feel secure here,MLeek
yeah thats how most bigotry works,MLeek
basically good people need to be on guard and thoughtful or they end up reflecting and acting on it,MLeek
intent is nice buts its not everything and its doesnt cure anything kindness is work not a hope not a feeling not an intent a thing you have to actually do,MLeek
so you have no advice you have a shallow pedantic platitude that is vague shaming and silencing of totally legitimate boundaries and criticisms  for the others sincerely trying to help,MLeek
the sister did her parents decided her cooking wasnt up to par,MLeek
perfectly reasonable that she stopped trying to contribute in that way if that is the feedback she got,MLeek
if he lost 11 lbs in a month he probably needs to speak to a doctor that is what you should be on him about immediately,MLeek
no one is refusing to feed him,MLeek
hes refusing to eat,MLeek
hes hypercritical of both your mother and your sister and he wont eat there is food he has a car arguably knows where stores are he appears to be competent and can solve problems in his life he has chosen not too,MLeek
you cannot fix this but try to find a doctor wholl give him a talking too and to build that relationship incase there is something else going on here medically or cognitively tell your father hes an adult and is capable of keeping himself basically healthy it is disappointing that he is blaming others for his behaviour and you are concerned for his health if he doesnt change his actions,MLeek
no hes almost certainly not,MLeek
he is almost certainly toying with you because you havent told him youre not a plaything but a colleague the same as any of the men,MLeek
take a huge step back from him avoid hun like the plague when booze is involved this is not your friend hes using his wife to get a green card hes using you to feel good at work,MLeek
this is not safe emotional investment or a wise move for your career youre becoming a subject of office gossip huge huge step back from this personal connection,MLeek
its not a positive conversation he treated op in a way that is unacceptable  the only reason its a conversation is because it is out of character,MLeek
if you have advice offer it but i dont believe in holding peoples hands when are being cruel i start with i think this is cruel and i need you to stop it from there we can move forward,MLeek
i mean there is almost certainly some misogyny going on here he tried to demand she make herself ugly so she wouldnt rebound too fast thats not happening in a vacuum and suggests hes got a few concerning ideas about women and men going on here,MLeek
but yes if something isnt a pattern better to start with a firm this is not okay we can talk about what youre going through and what you are feeling but you need to know i am not going to accept being treated this way,MLeek
is dropping by his desk for an actual chat a possibility,MLeek
personally i really dont think its that rude to ignore a nonwork related chat for that long im an avid user of slack but my expectations for responses are entirely different if im asking a work question or if im asking how their cat is doing,MLeek
but you are right it is a struggle to make connections without some text chatting perhaps it would help to give yourself an assignment and carve out a few minutes in your day to catch up with text messages you may never enjoy it but if you treat it as a necessary task that needs to be performed in order to maintain social connections you can probably do it fine,MLeek
meeting people to date is really more like a shitty part time job than a fun hobby i dont think there is anything wrong with admitting that and just doing the work to get you where you want to be,MLeek
i am shocked that suggesting you should trust your wife she speaks was so upsetting to you,MLeek
its strange that youre arguing for nuance and the need for thoughtful consideration of communication while not be able to exercise much of either but its clear that youve been triggered too severely for me to be helpful good luck,MLeek
as is your right with advice,MLeek
but you asked and she confirmed she was serious you still dont want too risk it with your career,MLeek
youre right youre not being a rational actor youre trying to leverage your assumptions about her mental state and emotions  assumptions that are the exact opposite of what she clearly said  in order to justify the choice you want to make its a reasoning flaw,MLeek
all im advising you to do is make the choice without the part where you treat her like shes the irrational and untrustworthy one you dont need to make assumptions about her feelings to be honest with her about yours,MLeek
by all means marry her but dont try to read her mind to get the outcome you want be transparent with your mind there is nothing childish about that,MLeek
dont marry someone you dont take seriously when they express their needs,MLeek
say no if the choice is no  is the risk is too much and you need to stick to the plan say so  but own that choice for yourself and stop trying to justify it by demeaning and condescending to her and telling yourself its okay to not believe her when she speaks that will come back to bite you,MLeek
thats a lot of words to say that you have a type,MLeek
you probably should be way more concerned that youre repeating toxic patterns in your own relationships then you should be that people of a similar age in an similar area connected with another as friends,MLeek
open with that then this is extremely out of character and im not cool with how we left it im deeply concerned youd behave this way and im looking for a reasonable explanation for the totally unkind and unreasonable way youre treating me right now,MLeek
the only thing they can do is try to tell the gf which puts them back in the line of fire for their abuser,MLeek
she doesnt have the information she needs in order to protect anyone here except herself,MLeek
so no i dont agree that is likely to achieve anything or that op has a responsibility to set herself on fire over things she cannot prove or protect anyone else from,MLeek
he probably is im sorry but youre right,MLeek
unless thats a crime where you live then there is nothing you can do about it even if it is one there is probably still nothing you can do if hes just showing then to friends and not posting them publicly,MLeek
thats a reality youre going to have to live with it shouldnt be i wish i could stop it for you but i cant the safest thing for you is have absolutely zero contact of any kind with him or anyone close to him,MLeek
tell him this doesnt wait until you maybe get more serious he has an intelligent highenergy breed he needs to be taking proper care of right now and proper care includes training,MLeek
if he doesnt take it seriously now he never really will maybe hell let it be your job and hell resist you every step of the way,MLeek
in your position id be brutally clear i cannot respect people who do not train their young dogs to be safe around people and dogs the fact hes decided to just not bother right now is a real mark against his character,MLeek
there is no crime to report,MLeek
it is extremely unlikely bringing your concerns to his new gf will do anything besides trigger harassment,MLeek
there is nothing productive you can do sometimes bad things are just bad and there is nothing to do about it,MLeek
you need to block both of them everywhere you cannot punish him or save her,MLeek
that is a bizarrely shallow and controlling sentiment hes expressing he wants you to make yourself in his mind unappealing to other men out of respect yuck does he also expect you to be wear a black veil for a year and then purples and greys for at least six more months after that,MLeek
my bf and i were joking about death recently and he told me to use some of his life insurance to buy a really good vibrator if i didnt feel like playing cougar right away,MLeek
i would suggest you not try to make this right he issued an amazingly petty shittest tell him it was both bizarre and unkind for him to try to dictate how you might theoretically grieve like he doesnt trust you to be actually devastated by his death he needs to imagine youll also need to make yourself again he imagines ugly to ensure you dont immediately start dating again that insane,MLeek
break up with him and end all contact,MLeek
he cheated because he wanted to cheat nothing you ever did made him do it you didnt cast a spell hes a person who can choose not to be shit he choose to cheat and hes telling you hes gonna do it again,MLeek
this will all make a lot more sense when you stop talking to this manipulative piece of shit person,MLeek
i think its silly not to accept what is basically market rate from your gf,MLeek
if you stick to your plan and shes truly not comfortable with it then shell simply end up paying more elsewhere anyways,MLeek
you might also consider connecting with any schoolscolleges in the area and trying to find a short term lodger 36 months i did this a little while to supplement my income but so as not to commit to anyone long term where i live they also pay a bit more and if there is a serious problem you can let their school know,MLeek
its just compatibility,MLeek
telling the truth did exactly what it is supposed too,MLeek
it was better to find out now than later that you were youre going to be incompatible with lots of people for one reason or another if you were incompatible in this way its absurdly unlikely that you were magically perfect for another in all others these things tend to spill over,MLeek
ah thank you you too,MLeek
although in all honesty mine is so far behind me now i really dont look back at it with anything a sense of humour and gratitude that i stayed basically safe part of current awesomeness,MLeek
my little brother made the mistake of pulling this women wouldnt fight in ww3 bullshit on us last week,MLeek
he has type 2 diabetes asthma and is nearsighted he will have a desk job every single one of his sisters is way way more likely to see combat than he is,MLeek
i dont know who the imagine that housework is being done for like just for ourselves would be grand but not economically viable the exact opposite happened last time industry ramped up the women went to work,MLeek
im sorry you went through this it does suck but it really wasnt about you it was all about him being able to keep the mask up until anything was expected of him besides easy words,MLeek
am i right to assume his divorce was really resent and hes still very bitter and inexperienced at living alone cause women his own age probably wouldnt touch him with a ten foot pole if he was acting this way they would definitely bail the moment he accused them of being emotionally abusive  like his ex now you know as well what to listen for take the lesson but dont take it personally its not about you its about him still performing his old toxic patterns  hes not trying to avoid them in you he was trying to enforce them on you,MLeek
can see why this man is a divorcee who picked an ldr with a woman a decade younger than him,MLeek
dont take it too personally be proud of yourself for confronting him on his shitty inconsiderate behaviour that took some stones its not a cultural thing it a selfish person thing tell him its over and then block him dont bother trying to explain anymore im sure his exwife told him over and over again until she lost her voice,MLeek
no shaming of sex workers or sustained celebrators intended,MLeek
i remember my hook up years when my standards were rock bottom and i was chasing self worth through dating and casual sex,MLeek
and 3 new men a week who could string a sentence together and brush their damn their teeth while also working 50 hours and being an adult impossible absolutely not happening not one week ever not if i spent every waking moment swiping and chatting,MLeek
i know a few sex workers and i dont think even their average week includes three new clients,MLeek
our bodies dont exist except as products on a shelf,MLeek
thats gross i really hope that is an esl issue because this is not a respectful way for him to speaking about these women and it sounds like both have some difficulties with respecting the women in this sport,MLeek
if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him,MLeek
we cannot read his mind any better than you can if that is what you think of him and his temper act accordingly,MLeek
no you cannot find out you have trust and respect or not,MLeek
if you sincerely believe your partner is targeting women in his sport to perform violence on them when hes angry with you then you should not date him,MLeek
because that appears to be what you are saying and you must see that is an insane thing to think about a person and then stay with them,MLeek
except you dont not when you assume hes letting them win or they are fundamentally of less value to him as a competitors than a man would be respect isnt a claim its a practice,MLeek
do you want to be an athlete and wrestle with men,MLeek
if not then yes that is a possible hypocrisy but its also picking a fight about something you dont even want for yourself anyways,MLeek
you need to get a grip if you trust him trust him when he tells you what is normal in the sport he practices,MLeek
you are misunderstanding a culture which should be rooted mutual respect and sportsmanship  and often is you are underestimating how much skills can matter and you are severely underestimating these pro woman no one is letting them win,MLeek
women participate in the sport with men and his explanation is plausible with nothing else to go on these women deserve your respect as athletes,MLeek
the issue here is not the sport,MLeek
if you otherwise trust him and your conflict resolution remains healthy and productive i would advise you to let go of this entirely,MLeek
love it,MLeek
even if we assumed every single woman on of was an active creator of sexual content and was an american woman between 18 and 35 ya still get 19 of roughly the 55 million american woman between 18 and 35 with an of account,MLeek
and they arent all american or all selling sex and only an even smaller minority are active so even with the most generous take on this its less than 2 roughly the same percentage of women who leave their christmastree up till february,MLeek
strange way to tell us that the algorithm knows youre not interested in content from women unless they have an of,MLeek
all in all youre dating a person who doesnt have much bandwidth or skills to deal with a normal disappointments and daily struggles in his own life  and judges and mischaracterizes your struggles because of his own limits and lack of awareness he may not be consciously projecting but it doesnt really matter end result is the same even if hes not malicious about it he has been consistent about telling you what support he can offer and consistent in his refusal to seek treatment,MLeek
hes not being consistently kind youre not compatible,MLeek
as a 25 year old who has embraced treatment and learned the skills she needs to find success in her own terms you probably actually have less in common when him than you do many neurotypicals,MLeek
you apologize,MLeek
you acknowledge youre both angry and that being angry with him for not waking you wasnt entirely fair,MLeek
you admit that while its not his job you probably should be asking him for the favour of the occasional wake up  because you have a medical condition you cannot perfectly control thats not making it his job that is asking for his support with something that isnt his job,MLeek
and you probably have to do some listening to some frustration and unhappiness he has as well hes probably pissed too and hes got about the same rights to it as you do,MLeek
and then you probably talk to your doctor about some sleep aids if youve already done everything you can on your own to manage your sleep hygiene,MLeek
yeah youre the asshole here,MLeek
if he had agreed that on this one day he would wake you by x time so you two could stick to your shared plans then youre be justified in being angry with him for not doing so,MLeek
but thats not what happened what actually happened in the vague plans kept on shifting and he didnt really know what was to do when you fell back asleep he likely felt rationally that he was gonna piss you off regardless of what he did he didnt have information to act on feelings are not instructions or directions to be woken or left to sleep,MLeek
right now youre pissed with him for not doing something he didnt agree to do which you didnt ask him to do and both agree he fundamentally shouldnt be expected to do,MLeek
being disappointed in the situation is totally fair being angry with him was not youre both frustrated with something medical right now that neither of you can perfectly solve,MLeek
you need to ask for what you need clearly i would suggest in the short term being clear with him that if youre sleeping through commitments with him you would appreciate him waking you up so you can keep those plans,MLeek
he cannot be your human alarm clock everyday but he can and should be able to come and get ya when you two have agreement,MLeek
thats not totally fair,MLeek
men also use it against men when its convenient to them to argue that all men are biologically programmed to be unfaithful or sexually violent,MLeek
the loss part of this is what is wildest,MLeek
any halfway sane woman hearing that would be calling a lawyer and opening accounts without his name on them people loose their jobs all the time someone who raided the family saving account to immediately pay off their employer is not just getting laid off,MLeek
this guy seems to thinks loving him means turning off your rational brain and walking joyfully in to the jail cell beside him,MLeek
i have this theory that women arent bullying one another enough anymore to create enough insecure women willing to date me so i have to get way better at lying to women to work around the amount of mutual respect they have for one another and now expect from men i tell extravagant lies like i respect you and acknowledge your value as a person instead of ugly truths like you actually have no value as a human being if i dont find you personally fuckable and available,MLeek
i fucked up at my job so badly i was fired and i was financially liable and paid it from our savings cause ya know were married its probably not just mine but no lets not discuss it further and im gonna just chill at home for the next two weeks while you panic and  hah not psych lol you should have seen your face wait why are your bags packed,MLeek
without knowing what the thing is its impossible to form much of an opinion on the risk to the relationship and if your anxiety is something you simply need to manage yourself,MLeek
your boyfriend is nearly 30 doesnt have his life together in the least has a history of cheating and instability in general and is 100 going to sleep with this woman after moving in with her,MLeek
get yourself sorted find an affordable for place for yourself and a job if youre going to school you might find they have resources to help you find a room or a job that fits with your schedule most schools want you to keep paying tuition so they may have some advice for you definitely call them and try to find someone to speak to before you move back to a parent who isnt supportive,MLeek
when youre 29 youre gonna look back at this guy at his choices and his emotional manipulation and your mind is going to boggle,MLeek
keep on loving him if you want but dont be an idiot keep your financial and home life completely separate he cant be trusted partner when it comes to money or a place to live,MLeek
dude you got rejected by someone you chatted with for a few days whose intentions were right there in her profile,MLeek
this isnt a pattern this is not a friendzoning and you are far too old to use that word,MLeek
this is a person who was always offering you friendship and you were disappointed by that,MLeek
given your feelings you should probably decline her offer of friendship,MLeek
you cannot fix this for her she needs to acknowledge it is unhealthy and do better for her own sake as well as the relationships,MLeek
and that is really unlikely to happen,MLeek
youre being played,MLeek
hes in debt deep which means you are too you need to stop the bleeding,MLeek
you flirted with an ex you did cheat anyone sane would consider that a violation of the relationship agreement,MLeek
stop being a dipshit admit what you did recognize that getting dumped for it is perfectly fair reasonable,MLeek
its strange that you wouldnt begin with husband i want to work towards a mortgage and to do that i need to have a better idea of our financial position  and that includes the business lets book some time to sit down and go over the financial situation together with the accountant,MLeek
the fact hes being vague is what needs to change deal with that reality dont tip toe around it and work behind his back thats isnt going to fix the problems here the finances are only half the equation,MLeek
youre in an abusive relationship,MLeek
hes escalating because your dependency is escalating he doesnt have to work so hard to mask his behaviours any more now that he has you trapped,MLeek
this will continue to escalate if you relocate hes not looking for a way out hes just stockpiling ammunition for the exactly the sort of combative and abusive relationship he wants to have with you,MLeek
deleting the texts was dishonest when you have an open phone policy thats a mistake she could have reasonably understood hed want to know she was in contact with this person and she choose to hide it she violated the spirit of the agreement even if not the the letter,MLeek
its not great what she did  if she was here id be telling her not to date someone she needs to manage like that  but his reactions is the real red flag here,MLeek
she doesnt have to be perfect for his reactions to be deeply concerning,MLeek
i actually agree with this 100 that is what everyone should want and need,MLeek
but you seem to refuse to realize how your behaviour is not communicating that or making much space for that,MLeek
your behaviour  if its anything like its been in this thread  is communicating that you need to be managed and pacified because you cannot control yourself very well,MLeek
we read what you wrote man were listening and discovering your girlfriend was right to be concerned you wouldnt respond reasonably to messages you dont like,MLeek
the only smart thing you did throughout this was take a huge step back when you realize you werent behaving yourself and you needed to go cool down i suggest you do that again because this isnt a problem with explaining to your girlfriend why youre mad that makes perfect sense we all understand why youre mad the place the miscommunication is happening here is your refusal to recognize that she made a reasonable choice to withhold information that you apparently cannot handle what she did was wrong but her judgement was correct about your ability to take the information in calmly it was the wrong choice but it was a totally logical one and you are refusing to acknowledge that which will stall transparent communication in the future,MLeek
the problem does not appear to be her understanding what she did wrong the problem is you realizing that she was totally rational to be fearful of having this conversation with you and you reassuring her and showing her that you can accept upsetting information without acting like an enraged toddler,MLeek
if you cant turn to her and say i understand why you made this mistake and i can promise you that while i may be mad at times in the future i will behave rationally and in a way that will not make you feel unsafe if you need to share information with me that i dont like as long as you can promise me to not repeat this mistake and lie to me to keep me from being angry,MLeek
edit again that is if you believe her if you believe her about what the texts were then also believe her when she said she assumed youd be mad  extremely and irrationally so if you need her to end contact with this person ask for that if you dont believe her break up,MLeek
yeah cannot imagine why a 20 year old might be fearful of giving him a message he dislikes s,MLeek
can you really not see that you are coming across here as totally unhinged and irrationally angry i wouldnt want to talk to you face to face when youre bringing this energy no one would,MLeek
if you suspect cheating break up if you dont grow up,MLeek
this makes perfect sense to anyone who isnt used to using their anger as a tactic to control others get a grip stop throwing a temper tantrum at randos online you asked for advice and the obvious advice is  even when youre right and shes wrong you cannot bring this kind of rage at her and expect transparent communication in the future thats not how people work,MLeek
i dont even know you and based on your words  here id be worried enough by your lack of empathy nd emotional regulation to not want too,MLeek
while she made a mistake i can see why she doesnt trust you to behave reasonably with this information,MLeek
youll never know what really happened here,MLeek
but if you believe her that it was nothing then you need to work on being someone its safe to communicate with as well she was wrong to do what she did but it was a tactic to manage your anger and anxiety for you and this experience will have only confirmed for her that you couldnt be trusted not to explode at her had she told you first,MLeek
while nothing you do will stop someone who really wants to lie to you or manipulate you remember that most of the time you have some ability to teach people how to treat you be careful about teaching her that you are irrationally angry and have to protected from bad news at all costs,MLeek
they grew up together the sister and the h were likely in the same grade sister saw him as a brother figure it wasnt unreasonable for her to assume her little sister saw in the same way she was just incorrect,MLeek
it wasnt ops problem before and its also not now,MLeek
op said there is no pattern of malicious behaviour from her sister there is just a perspective and it was good that op got a moment to address it,MLeek
not everything one person doesnt like or agree with is some sort of monstrous violation,MLeek
just let it go,MLeek
its her opinion its not an insane one she asked you answered,MLeek
shes not being cruel to either of you there isnt really a problem here it can be okay for someone to love you both and have those sorts of questions,MLeek
your plan requires a relationship being a housewife generally requires a breadwinning partner,MLeek
there isnt a problem here unless your family is not respectful of your relationship and how you and your partner choose to organize your lives,MLeek
youre 25 if you have a goal for your own life work towards it you dont need your parents to cosign on it or pat you on the head itd be nice but you need to learn to cope without it they are entitled to their own opinions and perspectives and you are entitled to ignore them,MLeek
if i didnt work so hard she would be very disappointed in the situation it would lead to,MLeek
i think youre projecting your own concerns about your role as a provider and you both are going to keep to accept things in your lives need to be compromised its not just her,MLeek
if you are hiding from her the real costs of your choices as a couple financially and emotionally then she isnt making her own choices and compromises with the full picture so yeah based on the limited information and understanding she has she might be disappointed but unless you think she is a fundamentally really selfish and ignorant human being then that is a matter of understanding one another better and being partners getting on the same team its not a matter of you failing her,MLeek
it might help you to consider this,MLeek
how would your wife survive if you were in a comma for six months does she have enough understanding of the financial situation to be able to keep things together would she know where to find the passwords or who to call if she had questions about the accounts because for both of your sakes she should if you have taken on so much of the burden of understanding and doing the providing role that she wouldnt be capable for six months then you havent set her up for success that is a failure for you both youre all in danger if that is the dynamic that exists right now,MLeek
acknowledge that yes you are prioritizing the game and no you dont want to go for drinks,MLeek
you want to stick to your plan and relax on your own it may involve playing a lot of star wars and it may not either way you like your plan and youre sticking to it,MLeek
sometimes the easiest way to deal with a fight is not to fight acknowledge shes correct you are prioritizing that game over going on a date she has accurately understood and that is okay,MLeek
he has told you plainly he doesnt care about your needs and will not even be discussing them with you as if you are an equal or a person that he values,MLeek
how you communicate isnt the problem here,MLeek
youre not his priority,MLeek
there are no magical phrases you can use to convince him hes decided already,MLeek
he has decided he doesnt have to listen to you,MLeek
anything you say will be labelled wrong or disrespectful or mean,MLeek
you will never ever win he has already decided youve lost everything he is saying now is just designed to keep you afraid and shut you up about it so you accept the situation he prefers,MLeek
wanting to see your partner weekly is reasonable he is not offering that kind of relationship,MLeek
thats the reality you need to stop thinking hes just independent hes an asshole,MLeek
this is probably the core of it,MLeek
he suspected he couldnt give her an inch without her demanding a mile when it came to any communication during this time,MLeek
instead of recognizing that as the huge red flag it really was he tried to enforce this maximalist boundary drawing to a head the fact they are not compatible and she is not someone really anyone should be dating,MLeek
op got to the right outcome but he could have probably wised up a bit sooner and gotten there by a smoother path if he just thought hey i should probably date someone who you can respect and understand when i can only have a very brief contact during this week,MLeek
i also dislike like hyperconnectivity i can go a day or with low or no contact with my so no problem and i dont want to date someone who couldnt,MLeek
however one or two texts during a week especially in the context of a young relationship is not hyperconnectivity it the basic maintenance of a human connection,MLeek
i agree that a healthy secure relationship should be able to manage a week of no contact,MLeek
however that wasnt what this was on either side she was absolutely not healthy or secure and ops inability to fire off a sentence or a damn emoji one or twice over seven days from the toilet also doesnt speak well of him he wasnt deployed or studying the ice in the arctic he made a choice not to give his new relationship 30 seconds of maintenance and consideration even once during this time my father travelled and trained like this all the time he usually called once for less than 15 mins and spent 10 minutes on some break sending a postcard the bar doesnt need to be that high,MLeek
and 20 years ago was only 2003 we all had email many of us had flip phones and we still had pay phones and post cards it was not that unusual to make brief contact with your closest people during holidays  which again this was not,MLeek
yeah we also had different standards for dental hygiene too the mind boggles,MLeek
if youve got legal protections you can seek you could report him,MLeek
but if you dont keep your head down and survive find someplace else to go and thrive where bigots are not given so much power over you,MLeek
break up are usually a healthy kind of selfish like i said a relationship shouldnt be a hostage situation if you want out then you should be out even if your reasons are irrational if you want to break up you still should,MLeek
its normal to feel bad we never enjoy hurting someone else,MLeek
a breakup isnt a negotiation youre not stuck with her just because she doesnt feel like moving back home,MLeek
and a relationship shouldnt just be a convenient social arrangement or a hostage situation,MLeek
break up are really hard and disruptive but if you dont want to be in the relationship anymore it is the hard work you need to do,MLeek
no one here can tell you for sure what it is you want but the reasons youve raised here for staying together itll suck at parties she doesnt want to move home are really shitty reasons to keep working at something you seriously do not want any longer,MLeek
all you need to learn from this is that school and workplace computers are for school work and professional work and that personal questions and research should be done on your own time,MLeek
you know there was plenty of bigotry and bias at play here we all know that we all know that gay men are people and they can fall in love and choose to be couples that isnt porn thats dating or romance or being human there is no reason to try and read other peoples minds and try to poll how many people online are gonna get offended stupid people exist bigoted people exist we cannot pretend they dont and its just beside the point the point is people are assholes and school computers need to be used for school work,MLeek
anytime you are on a device or network owned by your school or employer assume you are being watched by someone and that someone doesnt care about your intent and might be an asshole,MLeek
you need to speak to a therapist,MLeek
youre carrying a lot of resentment towards your wife but it boils down to a broken dynamic and your own struggles advocating for yourself a lot of this is about the expectations youre placing on yourself youre also clearly just burnt out on parenting you really are describing being a fully involved father  which is great but yeah thats like the time a baby takes the labour division might need to be changed up but that is the work,MLeek
i am not saying shes perfect just that you need to do some work to approach these important conversations from a more balanced place for your own sake it sucks that the person with the bigger problem and the larger amount of work often has to be the person who adds a bit more work to their own plate first to start the ball rolling but i think that is where you are at,MLeek
you got a big ball of stress burdens resentments and twisted dynamics to unravel a lot of it is based in your expectations of yourself  some of which seem pretty excessive to me  and the partnership dynamic you have contributed to with your wife when you really lock yourself into a provider role instead of a partnership role you should speak to a therapist about priorities and how to start which conversations with your wife,MLeek
dude you need to find a new story,MLeek
all of this my dad was poors the girl of my dreams was stolen from me is a story a myth from the outsiders perspective there is basically no truth in it all its just you trying to project and assign your insecurities and jealousy to these other people without any rational basis,MLeek
you need to stop clinging to a story that says youre life is over because you missed your chance in your early 20s thats toxic its not what happened ya just experienced a bit of standard rejection imagining shed have fallen in love with you instead if you just had a guest room is really absurd its time to actually accept this rejection without writing a starring role for yourself in an epic tragedy for the ages if you cannot manage and reject these thoughts yourself bring them to a therapist and let them challenge this bullshit,MLeek
doesnt change that it would be a really big ask for a lot of people  even healthy and secure ones,MLeek
but all you can do is be glad you found out quickly this woman was not healthy or secure try to put it out of your mind as well as you can there is nothing you can or need to do until after your exam,MLeek
this is creepy,MLeek
lots of people like to leave their desks at lunch,MLeek
do you really think shes have a 20 minute fuck in a busy parking lot every afternoon you need to get a grip and talk to your wife,MLeek
there is nothing here to discuss escalating baseless accusations of cheating should be an absolute dealbreaker even if the rest of this was not,MLeek
however i will say that with someone who behaves better than this a full week of radio silence is probably not good enough to support many relationships certainly not a new one a few texts throughout the week would be a reasonable ask from a healthy partner  but this woman wasnt that anyways so just keep her on mute and deal with the break up when you return,MLeek
good luck with the exam,MLeek
youre replying as if i called bf the best ever who can do no wrong,MLeek
when what i actually said is this obviously sucks and i have no idea why shed want to keep dating him with all this drama and distrust after only one month,MLeek
when someone brings out the worst in you in terms of insecurities paranoia and controlling tendencies you just get the hell away from that person who brings that out in you no matter how much i appreciate she is genuinely and legitimately hurt i also think this is a terrible version of her and there is probably a better version who is more secure and mature who is dating someone else so we dont need to demonize him when he does something pretty damn reasonable you just get away before the bad dynamic messes you up even more,MLeek
i would refuse to date someone who expected id be constantly available to them via text,MLeek
i dont check my phone with im having a meal with other friends or when im at a concert or a play im out with people and those people or that art will get my full attention if i dont go the bathroom or need to call an uber im not really looking at my phone and its on silent i will sometimes have workdays where i dont respond to any personal texts that arent absolutely vital for a full 12 hours my job is not the kind where you carry a phone on your person at all times,MLeek
i dont know your relationship but i think he did the correct thing in setting the expectation,MLeek
you are being distrustful and a bit controlling and looking for every detail of his night,MLeek
you might also be being misled,MLeek
after a month of this sort of drama i dont know why youd bother continuing with someone you feel this way about it shouldnt be this hard for either of you,MLeek
you have some insecurities to work on if youre going to date like a busy adult with full lives but he also might be a shitty bf its impossible to say and it doesnt even matter this much drama and distrust after only a month this clearly not working for either of you,MLeek
this was utterly juvenile bullshit i wouldnt want to be friends with either of you and im not sure why you want to go on being friends with her after she spun this shit on you,MLeek
you realize shes using to you testbaitpunish her boyfriend right youre not really her friend  she clearly doesnt actually value you in her life that much if she takes dumb risks like this and then cuts you out when they play out poorly youre a tool shes using to treat someone else like shit,MLeek
you cannot do anything except ifwhen this comes up again admit you were wholly and completely wrong and childish af no excuses no explanations just a straightup i shouldnt have done that was shitty i am sorry i dont know why i was so fucking stupid as to imagine it was at all funny,MLeek
cause you were extremely stupid unkind and you have no defence here,MLeek
walk away,MLeek
trust doesnt work on technicalities he chose a very convenient lack of transparency,MLeek
and hes shopping around which may be technically fine in your agreement but you should leave him to it he doesnt need to cheat to be sorta shitty,MLeek
multidating is common but isnt usually a stage that lasts into the five or six months range unless youre nonmonogamousopen so this isnt cultural or about multidating really this is just a lowkey not great human being who is comfortable enough with you and enjoys the benefits of being your sorta boyfriend but is not willing to commit or move forward together,MLeek
after five months of casual but frequent dating its time to move on he doesnt communicate to the standard you should insist on and hes either just not that into you or hes a real shithead either way times up,MLeek
you could ask him for a greater level of commitment and involvement in one anothers lives if youd like but i wouldnt a nearly 50yearold man who chooses the easy white lies for himself where he technically isnt betraying anyone else is just not what im looking for,MLeek
youre never gonna know,MLeek
the best thing to do is not waste any brain power on it,MLeek
thats not cute or clever its awkward if i did like a guy a joke about other men and multiple personalities would turn me right off,MLeek
just tell her what you actually want and then youll find out,MLeek
it is rude to expect to take anything home from it,MLeek
this one is pretty cut and dry youre right hes wrong he has misunderstood the situation,MLeek
it is not appropriate to go into a meal train visitevent with any expectation you will leave with anything a host may offer if they have too much or things will spoil too quickly but the expectation is rude and inappropriate the point is to gift them food they asked for your company as well but the pointagreementexpectation is still to gift them food,MLeek
its been six months its time for a checkin,MLeek
ask him how the saving towards buying into your house is going we all know the answer is its not,MLeek
tell him youre not comfortable moving forward with him if he doesnt provide more clarity about his debt situation and repayment plan because you shouldnt be,MLeek
stop tiptoeing around his stress ego and tell him plainly what you need from an adult partner,MLeek
he needs to be stressed and pressured that is what he should be feeling right now hes misled his partner about his finances having stressful conversation full of pressure is how you succeed at a life partnership if he crumbles under this pressure and cannot at least make a focused efforted to keep his word to you about money then you absolutely cannot have children with him,MLeek
you need to stop thinking of yourself as a provider and start thinking of yourself as a partner and a partner doesnt say oh whatever you thinkneedwant im sure itll work out when they are in fact not at all sure of that a partner speaks up clearly about their own needs and limits and concerns a partner isnt such a damn pushover,MLeek
im not surprised you feel like a pawn right now you have accepted that role you are following that script,MLeek
while she may be inconsiderate or poor at budgeting or have any other set of negative qualities shes not here right now youre here asking this questions and reading these answers right now nothing she intiates is going to save you from the selfimposed consequences of your own choice to not speak up clearly about your preferences and needs and feelings,MLeek
you need to be confident enough in yourself and have enough faith in your marriage to say what you actually think in each of the cases above you told her to make her own choice and then resented her for doing so,MLeek
moreover if she is the one taking on the work of planning all of these trips you actually may need to step in with far more concrete plans if there is something you want to be prioritized i could be wrong but the  if you can find a free weekend response sounds to me like it might have been a you do the work dont make me plan yet another thing stepping up and taking on a larger share of that mental labour and planning for family or couple trips might be a good way to address both of your feelings of being left out or neglected and to start approaching this subject as a team with a shared plan instead of all trips being primarily her projects,MLeek
its not that strange this is just you being attracted to the people you see as peers and it takes experience to properly identify your peers most teenagers cannot know what they do not know which is the whole reason some laws apply to them the laws are a bit arbitrary  but society has to pick a line so the line gets picked and we organize ourselves and societies permissions and expectations of young people around it,MLeek
but seriously dont date a 30yearold its healthy enough for you to see them as a peer but that is a lack of experience on your side still there is something profoundly and deeply wrong with a 30yearold who sees you as a peer no matter how wonderful and mature you are,MLeek
you need legal advice this isnt a relationship issue anymore,MLeek
dont contact him not yourself not personally not ever,MLeek
as i said not a relationship issue you have no relationship whatsoever with this person anymore you are not consenting to any relationship or contact any contact you have no should go through the lawyers or law enforcement or at the most a professional message in your capacity as a professional offering to purchase the domain at a reasonable rate but not offering to sell your friendship or any personal contact whatsoever,MLeek
reach out to a nonprofit that supports abuse or stalking victims access some legal advice,MLeek
or more pointedly dont worry about it too much and build your site with the same kind of accessible variation of your name that most people named john smith need to figure out link it in all your bios correctly and googleseo will quickly figure it out and send people looking for your full name to the site that is actually populated with content,MLeek
so that is the exact problem im advising you to address,MLeek
you need to have a conversation one where you try to understand her perspective and not one where you try to make her perform to your expectations seeing it from her perspective involves listening and understanding her choices you dont seem to have managed that on your own so have that conversation with a professional involved that is the only thing which will tell if youre are still compatible or not,MLeek
shes a person first and you are actually working really hard to not have to see it from perspective there is nothing here in this question that says you have heard or understood her perspective you simply report her actions if you saw it from her perspective youd be willing to talk about her goals and concerns about stopping her education or her work youre treating her goals and values as if they are just bad habits she needs to break taking a class isnt stuck in your ways its not a bad habit being uncomfortable or unwilling to be a sahm is not a bad habit its a huge leap of trust to put in the working partner,MLeek
i feel for you you are working really hard but youre not working smart when it comes to your relationship there are obviously major issues in how the housework and childcare is divided but youve taken such an extreme and closeminded view of it im not shocked you two cannot even communicate about it anymore,MLeek
if you decide she is nothing except the mother of your daughter and that her employment and school work are just bad habits shes stuck in then shes not your human partner any longer your relationship will and should end if that is your attitude towards her and you will be solely coparents,MLeek
look even if he had any reasonable discomfort talking about his partner he actively hid inappropriate conversations with another woman and even looped his parents into the situation gross,MLeek
you know he was full of shit and weaponizing your mental illness against you try not to stew on it there is nothing to learn here except to end things sooner and that is a lesson only experience can teach you,MLeek
i would back way up and get both of your butts into couples counselling,MLeek
and individual counselling for yourself this is not all about what you can do for them  you need and deserve support which they are probably not wellequipped to offer at the moment please make sure you get it,MLeek
you need a counsellor who is experienced with queernonbinary patients and respects ethical nonmonogamy but put a big old pause on actually practicing any openness or nonmonogamy coming out one week having a crush and pursuing an open marriage the next is not a healthy timeline for anyone involved here not them not you not anyone else unlucky enough to fall into to either of you in this bumbling sorta openness youre considering,MLeek
the best way to support them is to be healthy yourself and to sort out your own needs and goals some selfishness on your part isnt an attack its an important next step towards a relationship that genuinely serves you both in the way you each need,MLeek
take some space apart if you can get tested and ask for his records,MLeek
gather the information you can but recognize the information you already have is pretty damning your husband decided to be ignorant about this to make his own life less embarrassing even if it meant putting you at risk its a deadly serious breach of trust,MLeek
an sti is not a bodily function its a transmittable illness,MLeek
he chooses to believe untrue things about a transmittable infection he had before they become sexually active and throughout the marriage  that could be easily disproven by a google search or transparent conversation with a doctor because the false information he had found was convenient to him,MLeek
he exposed her to increase cancer risk with her knowledge,MLeek
that is nothing like lying and saying it was the dog who farted,MLeek
thats like exposing someone to an increased cancer risk and genital warts without their knowledge for years,MLeek
its been seven years,MLeek
are you gonna spend the rest of your lives together refusing to accept and trust your partner to select his own friends,MLeek
you can always leave someone whose boundaries and morals you dont respect but you choose to stay and have continued with that choice stop pretending to yourself hes gonna turn into someone else,MLeek
hes picking these people and hes gonna go on picking these people make peace or gtfo,MLeek
it seems you two didnt have a solid agreement on child care and finances prior to the baby arriving,MLeek
you made offers to her that you thought were generous and proper but offers are different from mutual agreements youre both very much adults you need to have conversations and make agreements,MLeek
you had very traditional expectationshopes of her and shes clearly noped the hell right outta that you cannot force her to perform the way you want her to she has to agree to it she has to want that or at least accept it and feel secure as an adult who is dependent on you in order to stop working or delay her education goals if she isnt willing to do that you cannot force her you can just choose not to be her partner,MLeek
you might not be compatible as partners but stuck with one another as coparents,MLeek
couples counselling would be wise you two skipped over some important conversations about the division of labour and finances and you need to have them now you dont seem to have any understanding here of what is motivating her to work or to get an education you dont have to agree with her or even like her choices  she can be an outright terrible human being for all i know  but youre stuck with her so itll help you to understand what she is thinking so you can have a real conversation,MLeek
sounds like you are probably fundamentally incompatible and that there is also a huge lack of trust here once you realize your life would be easier as a single parent thats generally the direction it heads in but even still a couples counsellor can help you navigate the split,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
the point of love languages isnt just to get someone else to speak yours its to pay attention and understand them when they speak,MLeek
my boyfriend doesnt speak words of affirmation very much but he knows they are important to me and he tries,MLeek
what he does do is tidy my kitchen and pick up my grocery list meticulously every time hes over he,MLeek
if youre not happy leave the relationship respectfully and honestly but dont forget that love languages are also about listening not just demanding your preferences be met,MLeek
your husband lied to you,MLeek
for six years,MLeek
the first thing you do is go get tested vaccines are almost never 100 percent and gardasil protects against nine of the common human papillomavirus hpv types there are more than 150 types while the odds might be good that he has one of the more common types that the vaccine may cover your husband was wrong and monstrously selfish to assume the type he had was one the vaccine covered he has absolutely no way of knowing what type i very very much doubt he spoke to a doctor who gave him the advice that you were fine and it was aokay to lie to you they almost certainly said your wife needs regular screenings,MLeek
you are utterly justified in requesting any evidence you wish but you might need to have more fundamental think even in the bestcase situation  where he didnt cheat had this from the beginning and assumed you were immune  is this okay is that really all that much better he chose to keep himself and you ignorant of the reality of the situation and the risk for a decade because he rather protect his ego than your health,MLeek
i sincerely hope no one in your life is ever in need of support regarding abuse this is a truly heartbreakingly horrible take on reactive abuse,MLeek
mutual abuse is rather rare the actual power and control dynamics rarely permit it reactive abuse is almost always present in any abusive relationship this is textbook reactive behaviour from op after facing years of manipulation and blameshifting,MLeek
reactive abuse is pretty basic and can exist in any abusive relationship between people parents and children friends and even employees and bosses,MLeek
you think youve got some special insight because youre being contrary but its just ignorantly sticking to a narrative that is as old as time itself,MLeek
a break is almost always a slowmotion breakup,MLeek
youre already on that path you may care for her on some level but you dont respect her behaviour or decisions or even trust her intentions thats not fair to either of you you shouldnt be trying to force yourself into a relationship with someone you have those feelings about,MLeek
be honest enough to admit to her that you dont want a break you dont want to be in this at all break up,MLeek
youre 36 you owe it to any woman you date seriously to have this shit figured out better than this i expect this kind of dithering from a man a decade younger than you no one here is going to have the exact answer for you except to tell you that yes its high time you put in the work and figure this out,MLeek
speak to a therapist if you need to sort out your own thoughts and come to conclusions you can live with for yourself its no longer reasonable or fair to put this all on finding the perfect partner and a rational person should probably realize that if youre unwilling to sacrifice everything to make it possible then its probably not going to happen because for most people having kids does means sacrificing a hell of a lot,MLeek
ignoring for a moment that having a much older biological father actually does impact the outcomes for the infant in some ways because more importantly unless you are independently wealthy time does run out in a practical sense youll probably want to retire not still be paying for school trips or tuition into your 60s,MLeek
dont engage with this person they are not interested in your safety they are interested in attacking you on the basis of your gender,MLeek
there will be time to reflect on how you can make better choices right now the choice you need to make is to prioritize your safety above all else,MLeek
the moment anyone punches or throws anything the other person is at serious risk of harm,MLeek
so the relationship is over,MLeek
no one has to behave perfectly  not women men or children  to deserve not to be abused,MLeek
emotional manipulation deserves a breakup not a screaming match not a hole in the wall not the real threat of escalating physical violence,MLeek
what is deeply sexist here is the idea that men are not capable of facing big difficult feelings without resorting to violence they are men are sensible and capable of dealing with big feelings and even break ups without being abusive without screaming bloody murder or making inane accusations and transparent attempts at guilt tripping without punching walls or people most of them pull it off just fine,MLeek
men can be capable of dealing with these moments without violence when they and others expect it of themselves,MLeek
hopefully at some point you will stop thinking there is anything people do that means they deserve to be abused,MLeek
edit and yes men are even capable of leaving emotionally abusive partners without violence,MLeek
its insane to think this is apology territory this is escape plan territory,MLeek
he is not sweet sweet is the mask he wears when he knows a sensible person would leave his abusive ass,MLeek
your bfs emotional and verbal abuse has escalated to the first steps of physical abuse people who will hit objects to scare and intimate you are warming up to hit you,MLeek
it may not happen tomorrow but this man has been telling you over and over again that he is willing to hurt you to keep getting what he wants,MLeek
dont ask for an apology plan the breakup and then execute it quickly the most dangerous moment for a person leaving an abusive partner is when the abuser realizes they are losing control that is why the violence escalated when you told him it wasnt working,MLeek
look up the cycle of abuse and then plan your exit from this dangerous situation,MLeek
did you read my last paragraph dude where i spelled out that you should expect and ask for the same and advocate for yourself cause it sounds like youre retreating into resentment instead of doing the work to communicate your own valid needs,MLeek
if you rather have your martyrdom thats what youll get,MLeek
sure bro and for decades we thought women couldnt have autism at all  because they werent disruptive enough,MLeek
its almost like there is just way way more pressure on women to mask and perform whereas men get to indulge in their eccentric genius myth,MLeek
its the main thing going on in her head right now,MLeek
your response wasnt just unsupportive it was cruel,MLeek
a complete no exam talk rule is telling her that she has nothing to contribute at all at the moment and you expect constant performance of good girlfriend and good girlfriends arent allowed to be stressed out,MLeek
instead create exam free zones or times over meals while youre in bed together make space for other another separate from her exams,MLeek
if youre feel silenced about your own stress or exams use the same guidelines learn to ask for what you want as she is now not punishing her for not automatically have given it to you in the past,MLeek
people are gonna pile on you telling you not to take is so personally  and while that isnt wrong  it doesnt mean his behaviour is kind or considerate,MLeek
you dont have to want to be the one who is constantly ignoring or managing someone elses every passing negative feelings or be doing all the work to redirect your partners inconsiderate bids for attention they need to do the bulk of that work themselves those are their feelings primarily their job its okay to ask for more kindness and consideration in how youre spoken to in those moments,MLeek
hes a grownup he should be able to manage his disappointment better than that at a tiny little totally predictable and justifiable hiccup where he doesnt not immediately receive what he wants,MLeek
it is reasonable for you to be disappointed in him for his lack of that emotional regulation skill and not showing you more consideration,MLeek
youre not controlling his emotions by being disappointed in how he is managing or not managing them youre telling him that there are times like when you are in the middle of work when you expect him to moderate his behaviour and handle his emotions himself not dropping them at your feet like a dead mouse like a cat and getting pissy youre not proud of him for expressing himself,MLeek
you would probably do better not to his feelings on yourself so readily  but i dont think the problem here is an equal one or a just a misunderstanding  hes not being considerate to respond with anything besides okay hun love ya talk later,MLeek
oh i have so many strategies for beingappearing busy,MLeek
but i hadnt thought of have you seen soandso since they were back from vacay i think they were asking after you a few strategically placed comments like that might stop the be friendlier vibes im getting,MLeek
strange i thought biologically we both basically based on 50 of our genes,MLeek
its almost like a sense of entitlement and refusal to be a full participant in childrearing isnt rooted in genetics,MLeek
well if he is then he apparently knows you well enough to know itll work,MLeek
why is this taking up any space at all in your brain,MLeek
why are you trying to read your exboyfriends mind,MLeek
youre newly married ya really got nothing better to do,MLeek
its a date if he wanted a professional connection he has linked in or could track down your work email,MLeek
you matched on a dating app its a date,MLeek
hes only sure there is nothing she can do about it once the way the baby is there not for a few years,MLeek
once heard a guy at work just straight up admit he say it that way she cant leave me while shes on mat leave anyways and then shell be too busy so im probably good until they are in first grade at least,MLeek
youre overthinking and these assumptions arent gonna help you any,MLeek
ask the dude out yourself,MLeek
i realize this isnt the best advice but youre describing almost exactly what ended my longterm relationship,MLeek
my ex didnt want to make the changes necessary to be a parent himself he assumed id do the work more than what i was already doing he wanted kids like he wanted a steam achievement or a trophy from the local beer pong league he wanted to cuddle them while they peacefully slept not take the day off work when they were ill show up at championship games but not to have to figure out the carpool schedule for the weekly practices he just knew his life wouldnt change much because surely his job paid more so it would be more important he shrugged off the changes he was insisting i make to mine,MLeek
women get shit on for going babycrazy but i know far more of this type of guy to go legacycrazy they dont want to parent they want to check the i passed on my genes box dont be a vessel for his ambitions if he wants to be a parent he needs to be a partner first and address your perfectly reasonable concerns and standards,MLeek
you cannot make her feel something,MLeek
its not about you,MLeek
shes been clear she doesnt like it dont pester stop pretending there is some magic spell you need to recite she doesnt like it,MLeek
frankly i dont send photos either by enjoy receiving them there i just dont feel safe and confident sending anyone any nudes at all ever i appreciate that other people are comfortable with this but im not and im not going to do it it doesnt feel good its not exciting or fun a guy who behaved like you are and created all the pressure on us both trying to earn my comfort would be extremely annoying and not someone id want to date,MLeek
you could be the most trustworthy human being who ever lived and im still not going to do something i dont want to do she shouldnt either,MLeek
if you dont enjoy leaving your comfort zone for her then stop doing it,MLeek
you only had a foundation of five months this was the likeliest outcome of a sudden separation and she was clear with you she is overwhelmed and needs to focus on her deployment,MLeek
it doesnt mean you did anything wrong it means this situation was not conducive to a stable and healthy connection continuing to grow,MLeek
cry it out eat some sugar or some carbs dont beat yourself up that an objectively tough situation in a very young relationship didnt pull through for you,MLeek
most people not just women want to feel desired,MLeek
its not about being a douchebag or being rude its about being expressive and transparent that youre into her sexually,MLeek
the relationship might be doomed you might be incompatible,MLeek
regardless youre far too old not to realize that very few people  men or women  enjoy sex with doormats we pretty much all want to feel our partner has got a full rich life they want to share time and energy with us not that they are desperately clinging to us and have nothing going on besides the relationship to which they give all thier time and engery we pretty much all want to feel our partner really wants us and is excited by us and isnt so terrified of rejection or offence that they wont express that,MLeek
this is abusive behaviour consistently baseless accusations of cheating are a tactic to keep you trying to prove yourself and service his needs hes set up a sisyphean task  itll take all your energy to defend yourself and you never actually will,MLeek
it may be time to tell him that you refuse to be played like that,MLeek
youre willing to work through his anxieties with him but not for him if he keeps trying to make this your job to solve a problem that exists solely in his head the marriage is going to end maybe not tomorrow but sooner or later you cannot maintain a marriage where you are treated this way,MLeek
ask him to see a doctortherapist on his own its a sudden change and he needs an assessment to make sure these fearsfeelings are rooted in a physical or medical issue do not agree to couples counselling unless he is willing to speak to someone himself first and he is willing to be accountable for his behaviour if he doesnt do those two things is is very likely he will just use what he learns in couples counselling to refine his tactics of abuse,MLeek
and its probably time to have an emergency plan know where your important documents are and know where you are going if you need to leave quickly you need to consider the possibility of real danger,MLeek
they are probably not legally married because he is on record as believing the government ruined marriage with things like nofault divorce,MLeek
unpleasant as she might be its hard not to feel for a young woman having a child with a man who has gone on record as believing she is property and should have no legal right to leave him ever,MLeek
looking through your replies here i had given this guy way to much benefit of the doubt,MLeek
you are being lied and strung along hopefully that certainty makes it a bit easier cause sheesh this isnt even a case of not that into you this is a clear case of shitty person is  fucking with you stop letting them,MLeek
i dont think your wife has ever had a 10 dick or toy or a bruised cervix,MLeek
very very very few people actually want 10 inches of insertable length seriously,MLeek
play stupid games win stupid prizes,MLeek
this was a stupid joke that you started get a grip and let it go,MLeek
do we need to insult her appearance she doesnt look 35 and rationally we know shes not and shes not behaving online as if shes much above 17,MLeek
she can be a deeply unpleasant person or even a bigoted and hateful person and still be in a relationship with a seriously problematic power dynamic with a man who appears to be nearly 10 years older than she is and openly discusses her and now his unborn daughter as property,MLeek
shes already the second wife,MLeek
its part of his origin story his first wife was seven years older than him and apparently started cheating and doing sex work two years into their marriage,MLeek
maybe the first wife was abusive maybe hes full of shit well never know but perhaps recognizing how the age gap impacted his first marriage he goes out and finds himself someone about a decade younger than him to toe the line,MLeek
he doesnt have to be a narcissist to be doing you real harm,MLeek
and no obviously you should not let him come crawling back,MLeek
and its not ghosting if you tell him what is happening so tell him youre gonna sort out the leave then as soon as youre not legally bound to him you will be blocking him and never want to speak to him again,MLeek
call a tenants rights organization in your area and then the leasing office the quicker you move to invalidate the lease the more options youll have tell them this strategic truth your exbf was misleading you and its no longer safe for you to move in with him,MLeek
all of his exes are crazy all his exes will aways be crazy he makes sure to drive them crazy get rid of him for good,MLeek
the baby is still in utero and hes posting about how she wont be allowed to leave the home until she is married or go to college because college is for skankroos,MLeek
first lady of the manosphere one might assume,MLeek
before or after ones eyes roll right out of ones head,MLeek
not having the papers isnt unusual,MLeek
coming up with several different versions of the story for not having them is and a young man spending several days without his phone in a hospital after a fall where he only has a bruise to show for it that does strain credulity,MLeek
dont call his bluff dont play detective this person has barely been in your life a few months and youve found them unreliable dishonest and only reaching out to you when he needs validation or assistance,MLeek
just end it cleanly,MLeek
act like nothing happened because nothing has changed,MLeek
its not like hes gonna tell your mom that hes a serial cheater,MLeek
youre both showing up for the meal because youre young people respecting your mother as host thats it just do that,MLeek
you dont have to be terribly smart to be an effective manipulator toddlers are effective,MLeek
we really just cannot know the legal ramifications in a case like this the parents may not have been legally entitled to visitation or the care team could have advised against it,MLeek
does it look bad from the outside hell yeah am i gonna damn the parents no they struggled for nearly a decade with a seriously ill and complex child needing to surrender a dangerously mentally ill family member to the state is a devastating decision a child even more so whatever they did wrong there is no question they have suffered,MLeek
op needs to make the best choices for his own health but hating these people isnt productive from a bunch of online randos,MLeek
what are you doing to manage your anxiety,MLeek
because while i think your mother is being unkind and silly not to just let you be responsible for your own laundry this is not really a rational riskmanagement strategy,MLeek
and when anxiety crops up in this sort of way its usually pretty damn prevalent in a bunch of other ways too,MLeek
or even just indigestion,MLeek
you ate too many spicy wings and are feeling pretty uncomfortable burpy or gassy or something well lets just put you in a possibly uncomfortable position and ram my body inside of you repeatedly or maybe a lot of bouncing yeah you could do all the bouncing instead what but why not,MLeek
it would be unkind to ask,MLeek
its perfectly acceptable to say no its just not working for you,MLeek
dont worry about if youre enabling them or not just stand up for yourself this constant shortterm loaning is exhausting and uncomfortable you dont want to do it anymore,MLeek
if she wants to let you know what is going on she can confide in your or not but either way youre not a cheap payday loan officer so quit that job,MLeek
are you in a relationship or a hostage situation,MLeek
hes basically holding a gun to the head of the relationship and demanding you fuck him or hell shoot it dead,MLeek
but its already dead tell him he is right youre not compatible youre an adult who is capable of compassion and nonsexual affection as well as sexual affection and hes just not,MLeek
this relationship is over,MLeek
it doesnt matter how right you are if you continue to attempt to punish her with demands of payment the relationship is over and youll never see the money,MLeek
its not about who has the right its about the actual reality so just face it,MLeek
consider 800 an expensive lesson that this is not the person you want to move forward with as an adult partner with more and more serious obligations and expenses continued grievances about the debt are only going to hurt you more not make you any wealthier,MLeek
your ex is an abuser and a manipulator,MLeek
i honestly wouldnt believe a word he says about his dad im sure his dad is hearing all sorts of crazy untrue stories about you,MLeek
the facts we know are that your 30yearold bf went from mooching off his dad to mooching off you to mooching off his dad again maybe as a super cheap babysitter,MLeek
wise up this man is already ruining your life slowly its not gonna get any better youll never appease him he wants to abuse you nothing you send him will ever convince him to stop doing the thing he wants to do it can only get worse keep records and be prepared to get the police involved if needed but end all contact with your abusive ex,MLeek
i think bringing this question into a group session with people who know you a bit better and have at least a bit more similar experiences is a great idea,MLeek
in the end your therapist is right this really is about what you want to do connecting with your family will be hard work in a lot of ways you dont have to do that work,MLeek
at a glance it seems your family recognizes that and is open to having as much or as little interaction as youd like,MLeek
this really is about whether or not you want to have any kind of personal relationship with them most people are gonna suggest that its probably worth the work to try to connect with them at least a bit because even just a very few personal relationships are pretty really important to human happiness however this just isnt a question anyone else can answer for you in the end this decision belongs completely to you and that does make it tough especially if youve spent a long time institutionalized and under care you may not have a lot of experience with big choices that belong entirely to you and this one really does,MLeek
you do nothing you continue to come when invited and be friendly and civil,MLeek
your gf handles her mother and establishes the expectations with her for how you are treated,MLeek
you dont get to make someone like you your gf gets to tell her mother what the consequences will be for their relationship if her mother isnt civil to you,MLeek
you did something childish and stupid,MLeek
but why would you even want to date someone who sincerely believes they need to protect their family from you,MLeek
thats clearly not a situation either of you should continue in at all,MLeek
you need to just stop every sort of interaction with this person except his legal form obligations to you and the child as a coparent,MLeek
you and your mom should talk to a family lawyer and do not allow him into any medical appointments unless his presence makes you feel safer and more secure childbirth even at it easiest and smoothest is terrifying,MLeek
regardless of any mistake you ever made do not allow anyone in the room when youre giving birth unless that person adds to your happiness and feeling of safety please please know you can be 1000 selfish at that moment you do not owe him that that moment unless he can be trusted to behave himself  and right now he cannot he is not behaving like a coparent or someone who respects you as a the mother of his child,MLeek
you made mistakes when you were a teenager in a relationship you were also preyed on by an abuser who greatly benefited from your inexperience and immaturity to get what he wanted nothing you did means hes off the hook for his cruelty or any abuse he commited,MLeek
dont rob your child because you feel guilty about being a shitty 18yearold girlfriend forget about being a girlfriend never be his girlfriend again focus on being a parent yourself and giving your child the best start you can that means clarifying his rights and responsibilities under the law to protect your child and provide what you can for them,MLeek
technically true and patently ridiculous are not mutually exclusive,MLeek
lets not keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out,MLeek
ive always thought anyone who wants to control and abuse will use the narratives available to them to do so those people who are seeking to control can twist leftleaning narratives and language even more deceptively than fundamental faith based ones  a lot of us catch wise to those one faster these day in my 30s i actually stepped back from some guys i was friends with because i realized they were using me to virtue signal their progressiveness to dates and gfs while actually behaving in ways that were extremely conservative heteronormative andor straight up toxic in their private lives,MLeek
my feelings have always been these sorts are going to get what they want and the politics are always a mask no matte what the politics are,MLeek
but the most truly feminist men ive dated are probably the ones who talk the least about it listen the most and just focus on living their own lives aware of bias and attempting to treat women equitably,MLeek
you can say no,MLeek
and it sounds like you should you dont actually trust him to behave reasonably or respectfully and even if you did i dont want too is a totally good enough reason to say no i just dont want that i am comfortable with the current level of contact and not ready to be friends,MLeek
no contact after a break up really should mean several months not two weeks unless there are things like leases and pets to sort out,MLeek
youre not responsible for managing his insecurities for him or keeping him from feeling any pain its normal and natural for you to be happier now  thats why you broke up its okay for him to be hurt by that but its not your job to lie to him its his job to accept reality,MLeek
closure is a myth its not something you have in your purse and need to hand over to him its a thing he needs to sort out on his own,MLeek
its april i assume the semester is over soon tell him at least that you do not want more contact until after exams its not your job to address his shit right now focus on the important things you need to achieve right now,MLeek
she needs to plan to do this alone you cannot do it on her timeline you need a job there and she needs to accept that if her income cannot support you both at least for several months and moving with blow through your savings then this doesnt happen yet,MLeek
do not move cross our try with her on credit card debt and no job lined up that is insane shes not a sensible adult partner if she thinks that is the right path for either of you thats not some sacrifices thats madness,MLeek
imagine something totally different took place or that this woman behaved in a way i imagine she did but is in no way reflect here for the reasons i imagine she has oh also women who date online are desperate and sad and only doing it to further victimize the poor mens,MLeek
nah hard pass have a good one,MLeek
i think i have a chance with you so you get to be not like other girls until you disappoint me,MLeek
is that better or even much different is i think youre a hot girl and i think hot girls are insert negative generalization meaningful different than not like other girls i really dont think it is,MLeek
hes the one looking down on others in that moment specifically other girls he thinks are hot hes not talking about attractive men or egotistical people generally,MLeek
lets say youre absolutely right about his life experience this is still not a compliment and she doesnt have to be okay with this sort of awkwardness in the snippet we have here she does a great job of saying shes not cool with it without shaming or attacking him,MLeek
is there anyway she can say please dont shit on my gender in general that you would deem acceptable,MLeek
he might have never met a black person with a phd but if he said youre not like other black people wed all know that aint a compliment and it aint okay,MLeek
yes how dare i choose not to continue in the company of a person who has a negative set of opinions about a group i belong too,MLeek
why would i possibly assume that someone who openly exposes negative biases and opinions about other girls might not actually think all that highly of me or may swiftly change their mind,MLeek
why dont i take a chance on someone who expresses generalized dislike for people of my gender its probably just them being clumsy with words no way they could possibly have realized or intended to be joining in the relentless stream of lowkey misogyny of daily life,MLeek
i see now that my standards are absurdly high how dare i hold the people around me to the standard of not expressing casual contempt for people like me,MLeek
s,MLeek
its not a compliment just because it makes the person saying it feel good about themselves thats actually usually a pretty good sign that its not a kind thing to say it all,MLeek
not only are you entitled to talk about sex and the situation regarding sex in this relationship you have too if it is triggering for them and they cannot speak with you then respectfully acknowledge that isnt the kind of relationship you want to be in its not fair to either of you and there is nothing wrong with you being clear that you want a relationship that includes mutual sexual desire andor open communication about sex,MLeek
it makes sense to be stewing over it right now days after the break up but it doesnt change my advice,MLeek
this is over let it be over dont give in to his halfasses promises of change accept the unknowable,MLeek
the reality is you will probably never know for sure and the sooner you make peace with that the sooner youll be able to move past it,MLeek
the odds of him actually going to a single therapy appointment are slim you know that he was just saying what he needed to try and renegotiate the break up,MLeek
dont get back with a guy youve always had concerns about and who behaved this way just let it be over,MLeek
lots of women have internalized misogyny its best not to take it too personally,MLeek
you know he was taking a dig at you it doesnt mean hes unbalanced but it does mean hes a condescending little shit,MLeek
your initial instinct was correct be less sorry to be rejected by this sort recognize your mothers limitations as a source of advice as well on what behaviour to accept from men,MLeek
deliberately getting black out drunk as a goal is a problem regardless of the circumstances,MLeek
you should be far more concerned about her ability to stay safe from randos or uber drives then about her past hookup if she is set out to purposely incapacitate herself in public,MLeek
i liked to club to relieve stress when i was her age but never purposefully got so drunk i couldnt remember or blacked out that was never the goal of the evening and personally i never found it that hard to not fuck around on my partner when i was in a relationship its just not that hard to not cheat,MLeek
im a combination of the all girls ive seen and admired in some way is a rather lovely way to put it id hope we all are a combination of what we admire in others regardless of gender although i know took me till i was a bit older to realize what i had modelled after the positive men in my life as well,MLeek
youre rolling those dice no matter who you have a child with,MLeek
you could both be phd astrophysicists and end up with a child who is bored by or struggles in school,MLeek
what is far more important is that you two have some agreement about the importance of education and how you will support your children if they do struggle,MLeek
the ability to be successful in school is a nice to have a partner who is actually your loving supportive and respectful partner is a must have,MLeek
nah that was a solid reply and refusal to continue down that path with her,MLeek
id recommend you block her everywhere,MLeek
if she wants her buttons pushed shell do that all on her own no matter what you say so you if dont want further contact enforce it to the best of your ability,MLeek
why wont women work in jobs where they are particularly unwelcome and subject to above average abuse and contempt  when they can even get hired to begin with i boggles the mind,MLeek
wha i dont want people assaulted at trump rallies either,MLeek
is this nutter talking about ashley babbitt cause that is just a extra plus bad terrible take,MLeek
its almost like the predators dont wear little warning bells around their necks,MLeek
youre not like other girls has become a straight up warning alarm for me it tells me you cannot maintain basic social ties or have friendly conversation with women you dont want to have sex with it,MLeek
its not a compliment its a concerning reflection on your character dude,MLeek
sounds like its actually the preference,MLeek
eh sounds like thats the actual problem here,MLeek
if you distrust him this much figuring out whenif his dad called him about the accident is rather besides the point isnt it,MLeek
i hope youre working with a counsellor theyll probably necessary at this point and can help you address the core issue here figuring out this phone call is not the core issue its the place the drama llama is taking a shit today,MLeek
are you in the process of divorcing or not its unclear you filed months ago but still call him your so,MLeek
if you are i think you need to consider this purely from the position of coparent not spouse as a coparent what contact if any will you have with the kids grandparents and unclesaunts or do you expect all of that contact and information to flow through their father to you,MLeek
if you want to continue to have a relationship with your exinlaws then yes you should absolutely ask after their health but not quiz them in their contact with your ex so,MLeek
im not offended at all advice is about perspective and im a okay that mine isnt of value to you ive honestly wished you good luck and youve kept on assuming the worst of everything i type you think maybe youre a bit needlessly combative sometimes and unable to accept another persons perspective or feelings as valid youre only options here for your partner is that hes an idiot or a liar,MLeek
just not how id want to move through the world and thats truly okay by me its just a advice,MLeek
yes youre 25 this is a thing to discuss openly,MLeek
just remember that opinions and situations can change its not a contract its an ongoing conversation in a relationship you should expect people to try to be honest with you about what they do know about themselves but not to know everything and not to be able to promise you exactly what sex will be like between now and 2065,MLeek
i didnt say you should break up,MLeek
i said i cannot imagine bringing such a demeaning and combative attitude into an important conversation with the person ive committed too everyone has flaws but i would never frame my partners this way or assume they had nothing of value in their own perspective or choices on a subject doing so would make me miserable,MLeek
good luck,MLeek
and youre not gonna leave him after describing him that way sesh okay i cannot imagine committing to someone in my 30s if we both agreed they were fundamentally objectively childish and just having to work around that,MLeek
i didnt suggest behaving like a teacher but communicating openly as if two adults are involved with some appreciation for differences in knowledge and values but hey if you both know this is what works good luck,MLeek
yeah shitty turn of phrase i can see how that was hurtful im sorry,MLeek
see she how fucking easy that is,MLeek
it was more important to your husband that he got to blame you for ruining the morning than it was for him to 5 seconds of emotional reflection and just say yeah ok i can do better,MLeek
our language is full of phrases and idioms that are hurtful and biased and bigotted no one is gonna avoid them perfectly but dear god its not that hard to take a beat and think thats not so hot really,MLeek
also how much dusting and vacuuming does this asshat do i might hazard a guess,MLeek
yes they can it can be wildly variable people are complicated,MLeek
some people dont experience much sexual arousal at all both men and women can be on the extremes of really higharousal or very low women are often shamed and judged for high and men are usually shamed and judged for low but we all exist on a wide spectrum and a spectrum that can even shift throughout our lives,MLeek
a lot of women especially young women are not encouraged to understand their own sexual arousal or ever express it openly sometimes they simply dont know how because there arent many healthy models for it but it can also be shameful or even unspokenly dangerous for them to try,MLeek
you were both young you dont need to be quizzing women or trying to read your exs mind thats not gonna help you need to be working on putting down the baggage you picked up from an early relationship that didnt work out well for either of you,MLeek
hoping hed figure it out andor expecting a better job at the age of 30 are still you describing situations that might be within his risk tolerance,MLeek
look i agree with you there is a real problem here in your position id be unhappy with my partner too but you need to stop approaching it with this insulting attitude that he is childish or evil he wasnt meeting your unspoken standards for financial security they werent his standards and he didnt have the information or the skills to know what yours were or how to meet them,MLeek
you should ask for what you need clearly but kindly with your ears open to his actual feelings and perspectives,MLeek
especially if there isnt a snowballs chance in hell of ending this relationship over this then put your damn fists down and set the worst of your judgements of his character aside begin from the place of him not being able to know what you dont tell him and you not knowing what his overall risk tolerance is in the longterm thatll be a way more productive conversation then trying to tell him he cannot afford to live like he saw his parents live,MLeek
i have understood that you are not interested in any advice or in adjusting of the thing you can control   your own behaviour  for the possibility of better outcomes while dating you want to date the majority of women apparently well also blaming all women apparently for a problematic system you are choosing to active reinforce and engage with,MLeek
okay thats fine by me thats how you want to play it then good luck with it,MLeek
is she cleaning up the children and dusting while also touching up her make up and taking 15 minutes to rest all magically before knowing whether or not hell come home late or not,MLeek
you can say pretty whatever you want and experience what you experience but you talked about studies and i think you took the wrong lesson from the data,MLeek
the lesson from the data is that consistently paying for all dates isnt as good or necessary strategy for men as they seem to believe it is to get to date the women who actually want to date them,MLeek
im glad you dont expect me to address your personal attacks so thinly veiled as genuine curiously but you gave my bf a good laugh so thank you,MLeek
the point i was making which could be actually quite useful was not about most women and certainly not most american women it is that if you assume all women are like x you are likely to only engage with women who confirm that belief youve set up a dynamic where you understand one anothers expectations you will be avoided or weeded out by women who are not like x or who very much dont want much of x in their lives if any so if you dont like x stop engaging in the behaviour that attracts and reinforces x fewer dates but better ones compatibility not high scoring,MLeek
you mean the studies that found women who scored higher in all three of the dark triad personality traits of narcissism psychopathy and machiavellianism were much more likely to engage in foodie calls and the women who scores lowest either didnt do it or felt they had done it said rarely and i would argue because of the guilt and social shame of accepting a meal from someone youre in the fence about,MLeek
i mean if were taking about the science men should absolutely stop trying to buy sex with meals perhaps pay for the first invitation they make and then switch to dutch rather quickly its not a particularly good strategy with any group of women anymore to pay for all dates thats what should be known widely  based on studies and surveys  but rejected by men who view dating more as a gamble as a numbers game instead of a compatibility search,MLeek
sounds like youre holding yourself to the traditional standard and then being annoyed that is resulting in more dates with women who accept those standards and performances youre indicating and initiating,MLeek
if a man in the early dating stage is taking all the initiative and has cast himself as pursuer i assume he wont be comfortable with me stepping up  and when i actually like him enough to try to correct this dynamic i often find i was right he couldnt hack with me if i wasnt a passive recipient,MLeek
if you were looking for actual compatibility instead of access youd probably have fewer dates but better ones,MLeek
i think the thing you really need to recognize and except is that he does feel secure with this,MLeek
he probably wasnt lying to you he probably wasnt withholding or keeping secrets this wasnt just technically good for him this is what financial stability looks like to him hes living just barely within his means and will i would agree with you that thats not really what stable is  for lots of people its the best they ever hope for,MLeek
youre in your 30s you own a home together while your current financial set up might have been working so far you need to see this as a big sign that you chew skipped over some really important conversations about longterm goals savings and retirement,MLeek
your gf seems to have unrealistic expectations,MLeek
your sister isnt her peer or her bestie she doesnt owe your girlfriend the attention and validation shes seeking,MLeek
does your gf frequently make vague break up threats when she doesnt get exactly what she wants,MLeek
he is being controlling dangerously extremely controlling,MLeek
hes also told you that he cannot control himself at all at parties or around pretty women he doesnt even really think he should have too its their fault if hes aroused by them,MLeek
break up and block him quickly it is unlikely the break up will stop his attacks completely you need to stay safe have zero contact,MLeek
you know he has an army of underpaid support staff predominantly woman who feed and cloth him care for his home and any children or pets and schedule his personal life for him,MLeek
which is why none of his employees can out work him while absolutely working harder every day than this price of shit human can even fathom,MLeek
watch out pearl shes way hotter and we know thats all that really matters,MLeek
you should have gotten rid of him after the rave,MLeek
disappointment is valid but this guy is just an asshole who cannot handle lifes hiccups without assigning blame and being a condescending shithead hopefully hell grow out of it but i wouldnt suggest sticking around and finding out,MLeek
i think being nervous of friendly men at 23 years old is totally normal youve probably met a lot of men who are willing and eager to take any opening they get,MLeek
but its not everyone as you age is a bit fewer people,MLeek
your boyfriend trusts you but you need to build your trust in yourself your own instincts and your own boundaries you got this you dont need to be second guessing yourself all the time you can be a human being and you can extend trust to men to be human beings  and you can revoke that trust in individual men as needed,MLeek
i wish theyd just do a better job of securing the provider type so id run into fewer of them,MLeek
its probably better that you not get too involved in the early stages even if it was your dialect youd want him to find his bearings through instructions before you got too involved,MLeek
i understand being disappointed this isnt something you can share but it also sounds like that wasnt a core goal of what he needs to achieve for his work that is sad but it also makes a lot of sense,MLeek
he also probably isnt aware of the depth of differences and the strong feelings between the two dialects my partner thought id be keen to use my french when we travel he had to see for himself a few times how my french was not always welcomed or understood by french people before he really started to get how different my dialect was from how most of the world speaks no matter how many times i told him he had to feel it before he believed it until then it was all just french to him,MLeek
that is childish and cruel,MLeek
if he has a problem with how your anxiety impacts his life he should discuss it with you like an adult and figure out what boundaries he needs to have or accommodations you need to make he can talk about that and figure it out,MLeek
if he cannot talk about it in that kind of reasonably way he is either too mean to date or too stupid,MLeek
he shouldnt be punishing you the way we do yappy little dogs or how shitty parents manage toddlers,MLeek
why did he do this,MLeek
were the classes easier to access,MLeek
is he choosing a dialect that is more commonly spoken or easier to learn,MLeek
when my partner wanted to learn french i actively steered him away from my dialect because the accent and diction are globally perceived as being cheap or not proper i actively encouraged him to learn metropolitanparsian french because we could still speak to one another just fine but hed get more use out of it in the rest of his life if it didnt stick to the way i spoke,MLeek
i can understand why you might have some feelings but i think youre being a bit unfair if hes choosing something that will be more broadly useful or accessible for him not to mention picking on someones accent or tone in the early learning stages is just decidedly unhelpful in my opinion,MLeek
this is the woman who once said  if we took away womens right to vote wed never have to worry about another democrat president its kind of a pipe dream its a personal fantasy of mine,MLeek
i think its a bit foolish to imagine she does anything but run her mouth for attention,MLeek
there is no realizing of any kind going on shes white and wealthy she got hers she doesnt actually give a shit she just figured out a thing to tweet that would get the attention of both echo chambers,MLeek
dude ya do you have a problem with bi women you told us so listen to yourself,MLeek
when you say shit like is the way i feel justifiable by my morals and ethics what you are very clearly saying is you believe there is something inherently unethical or immoral about women who experience sexual attraction to other women as well as men,MLeek
you shouldnt date anyone you dont want to but youre being a naive asshole when you pretend your preferences are not rooted in stereotypes isms or phobias they often are hell a lot of our biases against smokers are i wouldnt date a smoker either but i acknowledge that some of the beliefs and attitudes i have about smokers are unfair and biased and its still not cool to compare sexual orientation to the choice to smoke or being an addict comparing being lgbtq to addiction or choice to smoke would be kinda homophobic,MLeek
you said things above that make it clear yours are rooted in biphobia and nasty assumptions about the character and values of bisexual people you said yourself that you perceived bisexual as less ethical and moral than heterosexuals like yourself,MLeek
we none of us are immune from the cultural messages that judge or demean others you seemed to be capable of recognizing this when it was directed at bisexual men dont pretend to be blind when you are the one directing these biases and judgements at bisexual women,MLeek
dont date bisexuals we cool please dont but also dont be shitty and pretend its just a preference you got some shit to unpack dont put it on other people or let yourself totally off on the hook none of us are perfect and you just said a bunch of shit that is biphobic accept it and youll be able to better avoid it,MLeek
edit sexual orientation not sexual irritation lol,MLeek
you are being irrational,MLeek
its biphobia when people assume girlongirl is just something fun for guys to watch and not real meaningful sex between two people who enjoy and care for one another its biphobia when men are shamed for secretly being gay or treated like they are gross and its also biphobia when you assume a bisexual isnt just as capable of monogamy and loyalty as any random heterosexual,MLeek
you are entitled to this bit of irrationality and shouldnt date anyone you dont want to,MLeek
its not anyone elses job to make you not biphobic youre not a monster but you are wrong and you absolutely need to stay away from bi people as dates its not kind or fair to them to make them address your irrationality or bias you should probably be thoughtful about how you treat any bisexuals or pansexuals you know socially you are experiencing a bias that is not true or kind,MLeek
there are plenty of men who feel as you do i get it a fair bit i appreciate it when they just keep that hateful bullshit to themselves and acknowledge they just are not keen to date a bisexual,MLeek
source a bisexual woman,MLeek
i think its more likely than youre imagining if its no big deal to this woman or her husband they might bring it up when they run into each other oh youre s wife yeah we dated years ago back in  such a small world that we both ended up raising our families here,MLeek
no matter how small the risk you think it is it exists i wouldnt roll those dice on my partner,MLeek
youre doing the right thing,MLeek
you may consider asking them to join you on a day trip instead of phrasing it as a gift to them ask them for their company as a gift to you and naturally as it is a thing you are planning and want to share with them you will pay a concert or play a trip to the beach especially something your cousins will enjoy instead of giving them a thing involve them in an experience with you,MLeek
dont try to force cash on them in the end you are barely an adult in their mind be gracious if they want to treat you like a young relative who is not yet expected to contribute money,MLeek
when you leave send them some photos and a long thank you note of your best memories that is clearly what they value from the visit,MLeek
warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment,MLeek
it is strongly recommended to use async praw,MLeek
see  for more info,MLeek
youre 30 youve been in couples counselling for ages she says shes not in love anymore you dont trust her when it comes to money and you cannot communicate about it,MLeek
of course you should find your own apartment youre just coasting downhill with a woman who seems unwilling to actually break up with you set yourself free,MLeek
its a small town gonna be way worse if she finds out in any other way besides you speaking up,MLeek
and thats why you should do it for her sake to spare her any risk of confusion or embarrassment by not knowing something that some else does thats the benefit to her,MLeek
it is also about you feeling better tell her that this is ancient history and i dont plan on seeking out her company but ive been thinking about it and i know if roles were reversed id be hurt by you not telling me so im telling you really just to manage my own feelings about it and my discomfort with keeping it a secret and so that you never get blindsided by someone else mentioning something to you,MLeek
you need to start saying no kindly but firmly,MLeek
thank you but no that isnt enough notice for me to comfortably get ready,MLeek
im sorry but no ive told you i require at least x number of hours notice to host people in my home and x hours before leaving the home id really appreciate you respecting my timlines so i can join you in the future,MLeek
boundaries dont control what they do a boundary is about how you are going to respond if they dont meet your needs or standard and what you are choosing for yourself once you state a boundary you have to choose it enforce it and often enforcing a boundary means you dont get what you most want either,MLeek
the only power you have here is to withdraw your participation if they value your company and presence in their lives they will adapt,MLeek
you can always leave a relationship you dont want to be in for any reason,MLeek
you havent been happy in this relationship for a rather long time it would be silly to continue,MLeek
you need to end contact there is nothing to gain by treating this like its an ongoing conversation its not its over,MLeek
have you been friends for years,MLeek
or have you been waiting for years thinking someday your friendship will earn you a date,MLeek
because its totally reasonable for her to be fearful of the latter,MLeek
dude you have zero interest in understanding why this is a bad take and not how consent or respect work a bunch of people have tried to explain peddle your willful ignorance elsewhere or create your own op for advice on how to human and what does consent mean,MLeek
yes consent is her view mutually enjoyable sex is her view if its not yours well nothing much else to say youre just kinda gross,MLeek
i really wish you were just an ignorant teenager but ive dated enough to know youre probably just a sad adult who cant get outta their own way,MLeek
no man that is the twisted part about of this whole thing the fact she did it before is why she knows she doesnt want too sex is supposed to be mutually enjoyable and consensual not a reward for boys its a not a gift she gave other men but if withholding now that is a pure toxic attitude,MLeek
shes not withholding hugs shes just not consenting to a sex act she knows well enough to know she doesnt want to perform again,MLeek
if a guy wrote mushy love letters before and didnt want to with me than id assume he didnt much enjoy writing them back then either and felt forced to perform,MLeek
break up with her if you need a relationship where oral sex is performed on you she is not offering you that kind of relationship,MLeek
stop talking about what she consented to in the past that part makes you the selfish piece of shit here and that is not justified just because she consented to something in the past doesnt mean she is required to continue consenting today she doesnt want to do it dont be the next in a line of assholes who bully and whine at her until she gives in,MLeek
be the honest guy who admits he really wants that in his relationship and breaks up to go find someone who is offering that kind of relationship,MLeek
i love her and would like to date her,MLeek
this is why,MLeek
