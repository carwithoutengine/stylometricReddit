she doesnt trust you to respond reasonably to her dating life she doesnt want your opinion she is aware it is biased she may also be trying not to hurt you with the information she reasonably assumes you dont want to hear about 

if she doesnt want this subject to be part of her friendship with you then you cannot force it what this means though is that you need to move on and not keep trying to win her over she is probably well aware she could date you if she wanted too she doesnt want too
im not on my own today i think weve made the right decision for us both on balance  when i said it wasnt a problem i meant i was perfectly comfortable with the decision do you have a different idea of what would be best choice right now because i would hope if you did you would state it just as clearly as i just did and id believe you just like i need you to believe me when i speak

the one i frequently use with my partner is if you were holding me back from something i felt strongly about youd absolutely hear about it

you cannot fix this for him he needs a therapist to unpack and challenge what is in essence a toxic communication pattern but you should be clear with him that this behaviour is not respectful or kind and that youd like him to do better
you know he overreacted but youre also kind of full of shit arent ya cause it isnt just curious when you hunt the smell down say yuck and are visibly disgusted those are actions those are actions that are reasonably insulting to another person

this other person might also be an asshole but also you walked into someone elses home and insulted their cooking your behaviour was insulting and you lied about and minimized it when confronted instead of saying dude im sorry im sure its great for lot of people its just not for me

lifes easier without a stick up your ass thats a bit of advice that might be useful for you as well as for him but since youre the one asking do a bit better dont be such a bullshitter if you fuck up just say you fucked up and move on
be a grown up and express your boundaries 

you dont want to be friends its not an insult its doesnt mean she did something wrong there are lots of awesome people i dont want to be besties with

you have no reason to fear abuse or harassment from her give her the courtesy and kindness of telling that while you think she is a lovely person there is just too much history and you arent comfortable maintaining contact or being her friend then block her without guilt
you should explore types of therapy and different approaches its important o have some trust in that relationship 

digging into root causes is not actually the most effective form of therapy for a lot of struggles 

i personally prefer cbt which focuses on current behaviour and changing the thought patterns behind them

if you want to talk about how your mother treated you when you were a toddler or about the meaning of your dreams you need a different kind of therapy
why arent you listening to your therapist they have already explained this perfectly well 

if she wants a man like xyz she should go find him

its okay to break up with her without first labelling her as the hypersensitive bad guy you can just stop the thing that isnt working without demonizing one another
ive been wondering if the reveal of 50k fine for not making it to altar explains a bit more about why zackirina couldnt walk away when it clearly wasnt working and if the conversation in the bedroom where they break it off which was one of the few moments i had a tiny bit of respect for irina was only allowed to happen once the producers had agreed to let them off the hook
there is a line between addressing your partners biases or limitations and being condescending as all hell you are in real danger of crossing it here

it also seems likely that a lot of this is you externalizing your own emotional reactions and anxieties and assigning them to her character as if they were all her negative traits  when they really are more about your own bad mental habits and insecurities

i think youd be very very wise to first consider how you can adapt your responses before putting it in writing that you think she is childish and unrealistic you seem to be very quick to interpret her passing comments as insults and take them deeply to heart that may not be fair or true to her experience or her meaning

you may have a relationship issue as well but you absolutely have a stress management issue your anxiety about communicating your own needs and timelines seems to be the much larger issue here you should be looking for positive and constructive ways to communicate your own timelines needs and concerns about what the future looks like together to advocate for yourself in the relationship not reasons to call her a child or knock her down a few pegs or burst her bubble or make her be realistic but instead communicating openly about what you do want to work towards and when you think you can so youre both talking about reality sometimes and not just vague hopes or fantasies if you really think that of her then you have a much larger reconsideration to do
sperate your questions for a bit

is there something about your own behaviour youre not happy with feeling isolated from a tradition or norm isnt always a pleasant feeling but unless you are unhappy with your own choices that is a feeling that is entirely yours to manage as an adult  as you rightly realized no one should be restricting themselves so you dont feel left out they are in their own home not a kindergarten class 

feeling out of place is a you problem for you to navigate and manage and you are a bit out of place thats okay our families extend and can contain people who are very different from us sometimes it really is okay i am ludicrously out of place when i visit my family in rome its a bit awkward but a loving sort of awkward

the second issue is about what you want to ask others for as a favour out of consideration for you the fact your daughter asked you initially about the pool makes me suspect that if you say hanging out naked over our morning coffee was just a tiny step too far for me would you mind wearing some clothing if were having a longer conversation  

it doesnt sound like you need boundaries or strict rules just to give your daughter a heads up that while you are fully respecting and supporting her choices in her own home as a guest with very different life experiences youre struggling with some things
also didnt like cole at all he was attention seeking and instigating throughout he only got a pass because zanab was so awful hopefully hes grown
i want to agree but micha is plenty old enough to see the consequences of the company she keeps and make better choices for herself the reformed mean girls i know had made the break by 26 hopefully the show was the kick in the ass she needed
he only has these questions after she said she wasnt feeling it

op came here to get the she should have disclosed pile on  even though he claimed to be accepting of her choice initially  and hes exactly the validation he came looking for and very little advice on how not get into this sort of pointless argument in the future with women who dont wish to date him
you debated someone and insulted them when they were just trying to end the connection 

doesnt matter if you had a point that was a dumb and counterproductive thing to do that was only going to be mean and dramatic like i said before the correct response is thank you and good luck
i told you how to improve in the future  with anyone not just a trans woman you dont seem that interested that part tho did you just come here to find people to tell you she did a bad bad thing by not disclosing why is it so hard to just not be compatible and leave it at that or to not clap back at someone who is telling you they arent interested
no man based on your own story here you were mainly frustration was with being rejected you were willing to accept the situation  you thought it had been a good date  until she told you she wasnt feeling it

the correct response to im not feeling the connection is thank you for letting me know good luck out there you dont ask why especially not if you cant handle the answer without arguing with them no matter what else nonsense they have to say you dont debate them you gtfo and be glad for it that is what you do next time you get told no by anyone 

you tried to knock her down a peg because you were disappointed and angry with the rejection you didnt think you deserved to be rejected for the reasons she gave but thats not how compatibility works youre not entitled to a certain number of chances or even to being properly understood a trans woman doesnt have to fall in love with you because you dont react with horror

that the advice for next time when someone rejects you you say good luck not well actually let me explain to you the shitty things i think you did and why your rejection of me is wrong thats just pointless drama and ego defence

that has nothing to do with her being trans thats just a really really stupid way to handle rejection
this isnt complicated 

you werent compatible regardless of her being trans you were already not compatible she told you so given the differences in preferences and feelings about your conversation youd be reasonable to agree with her on that much 

while i would generally agree people should disclose prior to sexual intimacy  for their own safety more than anything  it really sounds a lot like you were more frustrated at being rejected than by anything else it really sounds like youre trying to make her the bad guy because she didnt want to see you again 

put your wounded ego aside stop getting twisted youre not compatible the rest is details take the l end of story
relationships arent hostage situations
most people understand this just fine

block him and dont take his shit

for anyone else just tell them he deserves to find someone who really wants to be with him it wouldnt have been right to waste his time and pretend to feel what you didnt  

or tell them he was manipulating and mean cause that is also true
tell him that the healthy and adult way to deal with feelings is to communicate respectfully hes certainly allowed to feel hurt but this behaviour should be beneath him you made a request for your comfort and he seems to be responding with spite

if he cannot manage better right now take a break and take yourself out for dinner
you should block him this is rude this is unpleasant 

this is not enriching your life in any way 

youre allowed to nope outta something even if they arent actively harassing you
why the only thing i could see changing my opinion here is why did he expect to be fired

if he did something to risk his employment and kept that from you that may be a serious problem or present a major judgmentcharacter issue 

otherwise i wouldnt get my knickers in a knot about a day people dont always make good choices when they are panicking 

you had even less power than he did for those 48 hours all his choice did was rob him of your support during a tough day
it is a bit weird but its also a reasonable series of events given the recent relationship events

let the sister make nice and go to the reception as a guest not as a member of the wedding party
id be less worried about controlling and more worried that hes masking his own serious doubts and real wants under well you cant really want this do you that way he doesnt have to take accountability or feel like the bad guy for leaving a relationship that doesnt meet his needs
honestly dont beg someone to be with you

ge needs to manage these feelings better himself it shouldnt be your parttime job in the relationship to build him up occasional insecurities are things we all feel but if this is a common tune in your relationship he needs to be told its not respectful or kind  and that if he keeps on saying hes not good enough one of these days youre gonna have to assume what he really means is that he doesnt want to continue with you

its good you have some time together planned but in the meantime id put a foot down kindly but firmly youre an adult who is capable of her own choices and those choices deserve respect feeling insecure is one thing constantly questioning you is a different thing he needs to work on this
i understand you dont think youre actively trying to claim power but if youre trying to say yay were a team lets solve this together partner when she fundamentally doesnt want to play then just youre deluding yourself and inviting more disappointment and frustration into your relationship and your own life

youre lying to yourself about the situation because the situation is emotionally unpleasant for you

support is great when someone wants it and is open to it when someone is not its just painful and insulting for both parties you cannot support her out of a thing she is comfortable choosing for herself support is not the issue there

you dont need to turn your feelings off but there does come a point where you need to manage yourself and make choices for yourself not her you cannot make choices for her advocating for her against her will is not okay  and will not work 

if she genuinely doesnt want to quit and that does seem likely to be the outcome of any difficult conversations ahead then this is a you problem its a you problem about what kind of relationship youre willing to be in
is he insecure or he is telling you that he believes youre not compatible

do really believe youre compatible what are the steps youre planning to explore that or test living togeather or are these constant rounds of reassurance preventing you from having the serious adult think about that you need to have

dont beg an adult to be with you hes plenty old enough to know himself and own his own shit if he believes youre not compatible in your lifestyles or careers he needs to own that not make it your problem to emotionally handle for him
she doesnt want to quit shes not being open and honest with you about that because she knows damn well you dont want to hear that message you want to talk about what you can do together and she doesnt there isnt a together problem here there is a you problem its the one reality you dodge over and over age shes not trying because she doesnt particularly want to  certainly doesnt want to enough 

you keep coming back around and around about trying to support her but youre actually not on her team if shes not playing that game

it doesnt matter how valid your concerns are or how supportive you want to be if shes just not motivated to change

you do need to talk about this but its time to have the real talk where start trying to take ownership of the problems you cannot solve and stop claiming power over the ones you cannot the problems you can solve are you can stop kidding yourself you can stop approaching this as a team effort when its and never has been you can be honest about what kind of partnership youre willing to be in
you just listed a bunch of reasons to absolutely not date her again but instead you remain fixated on the possibility she was recently in a relationship andor having sex with a woman and has chosen not to be transparent with you about that past relationship

there is nothing here to accuse her of there is just someone to not date if that is how you feel about the possibility of a relationship with a woman in the recent past

this is not about my hangups nothing you have said has changed my read on your behaviour the worst thing i can about her is that you allow her to bring out some ugly shit in you

you need to wise up shes not hurting you right now shes not denying you anything youre entitled too youre hurting yourself with assumptions entitlements and baseless expectations
youre noticing you dont actually want to date her  the person she actually is  and need to stop fucking around as if you might stop trying to make that into a story where shes a bad person own your own bullshit this is clearly not the woman for you
it was on the list of a thousand reasons and just because shes not closeted doesnt mean she wants to deal with your weird fixation and invasive bullshit

if i suspected you of the kind of assumptions and spinning out that youre engaging in with this question i 100 wouldnt give you any information about my previous relationships  especially if they werent heteropassing you do not appear able to handle it well
stop spending so much time trying to read her mind and speak up for your damn self if there is something you want or need from this reconnection that you are not getting

youre really not being much better than she is if youre choosing to keep the fact you believe they were in a romantic relationship from her

your real problem here  the one you could actually control yourself  is the fact youre not being transparent about what you think you know or about what you want from this renewed connection all you have here is a bunch of assumptions and attempts to read her mind

you dont know how they defined their relationship you dont even seem to know exactly how youre defining your connection with this woman right now

stop accusing her of deceit when youre not being any more transparent and forthright than she is there are a thousand reasons she may be framing it the way she is including not wanting to out herself with you or face any of the typical random male judgement many bisexual women have to regularly face because this shit is often just so damn important to men who have no business with it anyways
someone else cheated on him so youre not allowed to select your friends or your health care providers

big nope

cheating is devastating handling it respectfully doesnt mean becoming a controlling asshat with every other partner in your life
let it go

youre only hurting yourself by letting this bitterness fester

get rid of it all quickly its not useful to you
youre not wrong your bf is old enough to know better and it was reasonable not to want to discuss it over text 

and as much as you may not like t personally i suspect your bf is also a bit delusional 

i wouldnt date a guy so willfully out of touch with reality either about t or about my own legitimate anger with his shitty drunken behaviour
dont keep such an open mind that your brain falls out

its reasonable to want to date a man who is wearing clean underwear each day

his insulting manipulative and flat out verbally abusive responses to this situation are serious red flags and raise big questions about his character  a much larger issue than his hygiene
nah he doesnt get off quite that easily

his forgetfulness about her limits is still a real problem he has been dodging the real conversations and considerations he needs to bring to this subject and is benefiting from her reasonable desire for equity and using that to manipulate her into spending way beyond her means 

op isnt perfect but the fact op would like to keep some equity in the relationship when it comes to meals out doesnt mean he isnt also a willfully stupid and selfish asshat
he certainly could lots of people would 

but if he doesnt want to  or even if op does not want that dynamic  then he lives with her within her limits and stops constantly pressuring her with his forgetfulness and emotional manipulation
in the context of him constantly forgetting that shes a fulltime student on a budget that wasnt a genuine offer just manipulation a genuine offer would have sounded like of course not could you bake a cakeplan a movie date thatd be lovely

hes not as dumb as hes pretending to be hes as dumb as is convenient for him to be

op does need to do better but when she does this relationship will likely come to an end because of course she doesnt want to have to be constantly reminding him of things a reasonable person could retain without difficult and op cannot properly communicate her way out of his kind of bullshit
what makes perfect sense about it general labour is an absurd term almost meaningless to take them as a group 

some general labour makes 7 an hour other general labour makes 100k a year the difference is industry unions and tradition not skill or even capital generation

if we have social programs to subsidize some kinds of labour that you imagine dont generate enough capital to pay a living wage then were not protecting individuals in society at all were only protecting illusionary profits for the executives and owners
do you think your boyfriend is a complete fucking moron because you shouldnt date complete fucking morons and either he is too dumb to date or he is playing stupid to avoid the real compromises and conversations that are required in a relationship where there is a financial imbalance

its not rocket science that you have no income

youre not making him feel guilty you are trying to live within your means he should feel embarrassed by his willful ignorance and the ongoing issues of his inconsiderate behaviours when it comes to the expectations he places on you to spend 

this man needs to hurt he should be hurting 

if he says hes feeling guilty and hurting right now say good you need to feel this pain as well because you keep putting financial expectations on me that are not reasonable and any halfway intelligent person would know they arent reasonable for a fulltime student with no income its not fair that i have to constantly carry the pain of trying to keep up with you and communicate this to you over and over again i need to say no more and you need to be more considerate and thoughtful and actually listen when i say no

he needs to feel the pain of his stupid inconsiderate behaviour because you are describing an adult man who is either too dumb to bother dating or who is just so blissfully selfish as to not see that going dutch on dinner at restaurants several times a week is not feasible for a fulltime student

he should feel guilty about how he has arranged the expectations about money in this relationship he has been selfish and stupid guilt is the proper emotional response to being regularly unkind to you as a partner
people like you have arbitrarily decided some labourers dont deserve to eat
right she got a salary of 11 million and 39 million in stock awards and other forms of compensation

not much of a defence really that the average joe doesnt understand how executive compensation is structured the end result is the same her pay appears not be tied to performance and think of the companys needs  but everyone elses is
shes not into whatever youre asking for however basic you may feel it may be shes not into it

the rest of your relationship works because you have similar values and needs in other aspects of the partnership in this area you dont

you need to make a choice about the kind of relationship you can commit too and how much communication on the subject you can invest 

in the end though if she doesnt want what you want her to want there is no way to communicate past that there isnt much to work on there either you can make someone make an effort sometimes but you cannot make someone sincerely want something for themselves they just dont
why wont he have a diploma and a drivers licence

unless his parents are abusive or his home life is so unstable hes not able to get those things completed while living at home then i would make both of those a requirement as well as the job if he leaves home without those things its exceedingly unlikely hell get them 

if you dont want a roommate dont agree to do this hes looking for an easy escape but if hes not already doing the work to complete his diploma and take safe steps forward hes not gonna do that work living with you two either once hes in youre not getting him out until he gets really uncomfortable in your home
would be way more turned off by someone who has already declared i will reject them than i would by someone who has lived a damn life by age 46
id be a bit resentful too if i thought i was entering a partnership where my opinion would matter at all and my longterm safety would be a factor to consider and it turned out i was just a tenant whose rent fluctuate based on repairs a bit of resentment is a rational response to a situation where op mistakenly believed she would be a larger part of the longterm planning than she is
we dont know that op is extremely disempowered 

please we can be reasonable adults about this we dont have to keep such an open mind that our brains fall right out 

op did choose to enter the marriage on these terms  she can be held accountable for that  but the current situation does leave her deeply disempowered and with far more limited choices than her wife has reserved for herself and that is something they are both responsible for addressing 

the main gripe here is clearly about security and partnership even if op loved the home and it was in good repair there would still be some concerns here about ops ability to create a secure longterm plan
im actually realizing that while i might be married financially im still single

while this is frustrating and sad for you i think its an important realization and something to share with her her choices have left your longterm financial security up to you because her plans dont meet your needs or leave you feeling secure and reasonably they shouldnt 

so youre going to have to make your plans independent of hers and one of the things that require from her right now is that rent is just rent it doesnt change because she needs to make capital improvements or repairs the two of you need to settle on a reasonable market rate and then that is the money she gets from you towards the home if shes not prepared to plan with you then she doesnt get to rely on your additional support for her personal homeownership plans
but the market rate rent shouldnt change because the owner needs to make repairs the owner just needs to make the repairs 

ops wife has set up a system where op is extremely disempowered in all choices from where to live to what repairs to prioritize and even what the rent actually is each month and prone to emotional manipulation to take on more risksresponsibilitiescosts for home ownership without any of the rewards or rights op is totally right to see this situation as insecure and unsafe financially for herself
you both need some serious financial advice and ideally from someone who has experiencing working with couples

a rental agreement that changes on the basis of necessary repairs isnt a rental agreement

right now your wife has the benefit of a secure tenant you without the real obligations to a committed a life partner also you youre not feeling secure because you are not a secure and respected partner in the home youre a tenant who is easily manipulated emotionally by status as wifey whenever it is convenient and then demoted to tenant whenever that is more convenient 

if your partner isnt willing to change that situation then i think you need to take a step back and think like a renter 

the current agreement means you are basically single and renting from a financial perspective and you should make your plans based on that if youre renting at 58 and still renting at 67 you need to know what you can afford in rent and be prepared to say no to major repairs and capital improvements to a home you merely rent in you need a tenancy agreement on paper and the rent should only be raised in accordance with local laws or at market rates not based on your partners needs in that way you can plan for your retirement independently from your wifes property plans
you sound like you have totally incompatible goals about how to spend money and time if you dont want to fund her travels you need to be honest about that 

while there is no shame in living at home its perfectly fair for her to say it makes you incompatible with her as a partner 

if i had been dating someone for three years and they preferred saving money at home to starting a shared life with me id be questioning the relationship as well a lot of women you date at this age will not want to date someone who still lives at home simply because of the restrictions it creates on the relationship
youve indenified the right problem

he told you not to expect him to moderate his behaviour properly hes making excuses for the next time he behaves badly when he doesnt get his way its important for adults to be able to roll with a bit of inconvenience or disappointment without acting like little shits or worse

i would date a guy who said im sorry its something im working on but not a guy who said im sorry but its just who i am so youre going to have to accept it sometimes

dont date someone who spends the first few weeks warning you they are going to treat you poorly they will and then they will turn around and blame you for not accepting the shitty treatment
dont speak to what he feels or what he knows dont make assumptions or put words in his mouth dont be condescending 

dont create false hope the idea that you may change your mind or get back together some day are normal fantasies to have but they are almost always fantasies right now its a break up because you want to break up

speak for yourself and speak honestly youre happy you dont feel youre compatible you want to break up
the first thing you do to get through this is abandon all illusions of control

there are no perfect words or magic incantation that make this go perfectly smoothly and gives you everything you want  including the vague hope of a future where you reconnect 

be clear to be kind dont let it be drawn out unnecessarily dont get into a debate dont pursue closure closure is a thing for you each to figure out on your own its not work you do together

remember that he doesnt owe you friendship any more than you owe him a relationship you can ask for what you want but in the end if he doesnt also want that or if he wants to set this bridge on fire and piss on the flames there is nothing you can do to change that
this is all more than a little silly

i have rarely been the only person with my name in any class or workplace

your gf could go by that name she is currently choosing not for her own reasons consideration convenience or anything else ifwhen your gf chooses to go primarily by that name she can and will

my mother and my partners mother have the exact same name its only very occasionally confusion we know who is who
hes probably not the safest or healthiest person for you to seek support from for these big feelings 

for that reason i wouldnt do it you need and deserve support far more than he has any right to know what was in the end a personal medical event your ex is just not the right place to go looking for that comfort and empathy a week after the breakup
tell him to stop bringing it up unprompted its unwelcome this is the opposite of helpful

hes only making another barrier for you and making it a bit harder for you to be honest and transparent with him  because you dont want to have to manage his feelings about it 

tell him in no uncertain terms to back the hell off if he means well then he needs to do well and doing well right now means shutting up completely about this for a least a few weeks
she a mentally ill addict with ten years on you 

you dont handle her you handle you and you step away from a connection that is not healthy or productive for you
this before the reunion i was willing to cut marshall a lot a slack for being an imperfect human being in a very shitty situation 

now i just plain old dont like him hes not a monster just a big ole nope
jordon peterson retired from uoft he had not taught since 2017 which is a polite way of saying he was no longer welcome or productive in any serious academic environment and hadnt been for a long while

hes a grifter he found a more lucrative grift on the radicalization pipeline 

he did not and will not respect transgendered students he was never threatened with jail for misgendering of his students he was fundamentally mischaracterising the law he was merely sternly reminded by his employer that he was expected to treat individuals on campus with respect after he went in the record saying he may choose not too respect if an individuals pronouns if he decides they were being political or had a chip on their shoulder about it

the ontario college of psychologists is positioned to discipline him and remove his license  not because of his transphobia  but because of his shameless trolling grandiosity attentionbaiting and pontificating on subjects way outside of his areas of competence if you want to behave like joe rogen you dont get to keep your license as a clinician 

and no official position on homosexuality is laughable attempt at a defence did you really type that with a straight face if you did you may want to read up on his official positions on climate change thats funnier and makes it all the more concerning if paul is following him unironically
id been skeptical of this reading of him until the reunion he didnt mean nurturing he absolutely meant submissive and servile and he didnt tell her because the first rule of these philosophies is that you never tell a woman plainly what you actually think of her or her entire gender 

i dont like micah very much but i do believe she sincerely grew during this experience  and she needed too she seemed far younger than her actual 27 years  but her real crime with paul seems to be she wasnt quite malleable enough
no man what she knows is she can do what she wants and then punish you for a while if you dare to point out shes being shitty

that what she knows to expect 

if you dont want to date someone who behaves this way then you have to not date someone who behaves this way
why on earth would you want to marry this woman she understands just fine she understands she can bully and torture you into even considering this absurdity
and thats exactly the dynamic you want to maintain her looking ridiculous you looking bored

keep the rest of this to yourself
thats precisely my point

this emotional reaction is as much as a threat to you if not more than her behaviour and this you can control her behaviour you cannot

if you accept her premise that this is a war others will play along and enjoy the show immensely and youre far more likely to loose some battles along the way

i didnt mean give her grace for her own sake i meant manage yourself because the thoughts you allow to fester will leak out and could  impact the outcome here
just bring a bit of grace to the situation

even if she an awful paranoid little drama llama she had the misfortune to fall in with an abuser who would take advantage of those qualities to keep this even more toxic and dangerous her than they might otherwise be

we dont have to like a person or agree with their choices to recognize they are also being harmed

dont let her off the hook for her actions but keep your own thoughts free of malice
yeah thats the shit you have to not give into the temptation to tell your coworkers dont say anything that would contribute to the narrative besides i am not surprised he has lied about me i really just want nothing to do with him

dont get put on the defensive and dont become part of the story dont give them more to talk about or compare notes over the story in the workplace cannot be about your relationship from 15 years ago the story needs to be sandrine is really weird and running her mouth and op is just shrugging and saying not surprised but not interested
besides documenting what youre hearing and how this impacting you in the workplace there is nothing to do a big reaction from you only validates their private little drama

being disinterested and bored by her behaviour is what others will see its far better for you if you can ride this out until her behaviour is unpleasant for others
nothing you keep doing nothing 

you let sandrine have her space and you speak to your boss if her avoidance is impacting your work 

shes frightened of him of the stories shes told been told its really not about you but entirely about his fictions if anyone asks you that is what you say it was a long time ago but if he is still anything like the man i knew im not surprised he has her frightened he was very manipulative in the past i want nothing to do with him and i am happy for sandrine to maintain whatever boundary she needs as long as we can work together cordially

i know its hard to keep your cool but its your only shield disinterest is your best defence if someone asks you express some slight pity but understanding and reiterate i am not involved i will not get involved i am happy not speaking about him or to him i want no contact with him and sandrine and i can have civil workplace contact and nothing else
sadie may have attentionseeking behaviours but this wasnt an example of one

this was an example of you having some others issues with sadie and looking rather hard for a reason to confront her about her reasonable choice

if you dont like your friends dont be friends if you like your friends stop micromanaging them and accusing them of shit 

if you want to fix this apologize for sticking your nose in shit that is absolutely none of your business without making excuses or trying to justify yourself she may still not want to be your friend anymore i wouldnt want to be friends with you if you were gonna make accusations over changing my top in a car
one of the most common fantasies out there for heterosexual women 

this is just entirely personal reflection but i found that my ravishment and consensual nonconsent fantasies diminished a great deal as i became more comfortable expressing my own sexual desires for me they were a way to not be blamed not to be responsible for what i wanted i felt like i didnt have many healthy ways that i was allowed to say i like sex i am a woman with a higher libido and all the messages i got from most of my life where that i needed to be sort of a passive recipient lots of men and women responded negatively if i took on the role of pursuer or if i was really direct about what i wanted took me a long time and my life to unpack that i still enjoy that sort of play but its a much smaller part of the mix for me now
not a danger flag but certainly a sign of incompatibility and disrespect 

his reaction is far far more weird than keeping a childhood toy
some other things women consent to do when it benefits them

load trucks
operate cash resisters
design buildings
write code
operate on brains 

women are so weird s
his fees fees

i mean hes super logical and not irrationally emotional like those females so there must be something factual behind his intense feelings right s
it seems likely that your grandfather might have some age related difficulties 

i would recommend that you set a consistent time that you speak to your grandfather pick some thing that would work in your schedule and then stick to it religiously maybe early mornings would be great if hes an early riser

as my great aunt got older i spoke to her for 20 minutes early in the morning on wednesdays and then spoke to her a little bit longer on sunday evenings other than that i screened her calls she was bored and confused often and i felt for her we were both most comfortable with really clear expectations about when i would contact her
youre describing pretty normal dating for most normal people yes it absolutely does suck yes youre going to have a lot more rejection then dates you dont know whats going on in someone elses life and in the sorts of situation you never will

you need to make sure that you filled your life with some other joys as well youre putting way too much into these initial connections it can be a tough roller coaster to ride but you got a level of the emotional floor a bit
i mean this isnt working youre on again off again for a year you know this isnt working 

and shes was right she might also be petty and drama seeking but shes right telling you take a job you wanted to take and move for is quite different than you telling her what she needs in a relationship 

stop having stupid side fights this is over it wasnt working youre leaving have some damn graciousness
if were nitpicking a 27 year old is not a girl

if youre in an ldr with no immediate plans to be movelive together with if is appropriate for any plan that isnt the confirmed 

be honest and direct with her about your intentions clarity is important and scary to say things with certainty in these cases if shes hedging make is clear you mean to take these next steps
the vast majority of photographers are going to have periods in their life of this sort of work if not make their whole career on it naked women sell shit 

if you dont trust his character in a room with a naked professional dont date him

if he cannot address your discomfort without immediately talking about permission and artistic freedom dont date him he should be addressing your fears by talking about professionalism respect boundaries and goals were talking about collaborating with other people this isnt aboutma freedum or ma arts this is about being a good collaborator and creator with purpose

youre not shitty to tell him youre uncomfortable hes handling this totally reasonable conversation in a super immature way
this

i think this is where youre messing up  for me casual still includes a fair bit of friendship not necessarily dating or romantic activities but i definitely want you actually know youre person i want to talk to and spend a few hours with

a drink and a fuck is a hook up maybe ongoing hook ups but a step down from casual in my book the word youre looking for a hook up
yes it matters its gonna matter especially if your life stages diverge 

that doesnt mean it wont work out or that hes doing anything terribly wrong but dont be naive and pretend the gap doesnt exist dont be willfully blind youre not ageless thats a justification and a delusion 

and they always say youre really mature the 40 year olds who rape 12 year old say that the power dynamics fester because they are not immediately obvious to the younger person and the elder person enjoys them being mature for your age is totally different from being a compatible peer with someone who is older 

this is something youre going to have to keep eyes open to for several years in this relationship there is no dodging it its a challenge and a risk that exists here
its been 24 hours the window is closing fast

in my opinion what you really need to do is stop having sex and figure out how to manage your anxiety andor prevent condom breakage 

plan b is a plan b for some women it doesnt have much of an impact for others it is positively miserable thats before we get to the expense while you should be open with her about your anxiety and concerns that is a pretty big ask of her just because something felt off

if this is where youre at mentally you shouldnt be having sex until you have a better shared contraception plan and a personal anxiety management plan there isnt a physical problem here with her body that requires pharmaceutical intervention there is a core problem here with your comfort level with sex and its risks
your parents are going to start drama if they want to its understandable for them to be a bit disappointed put anything past that is a choice

accept this theres no magic collection of words you can say to control that or make them feel a certain way about the situation they are going to feel how they feel and do what they do

tell them youre looking forward to their visit and recommend a hotel if its an issue of money then maybe you want to contribute to the hotel bill

honestly though this shouldve been sorted out when the invitation was made it shouldnt have been held off until a few weeks before they arrive it shouldve been part of the structure of the invitation so all parties knew exactly what they were getting into in the future you need to make this a core part of the planning from the very beginning dont bring it up after the date are set

you may also consider just telling them the truth they havent always been consistently nice to your wife so in order to keep the peace you were making sure that they and your wife and you have space apart from one another during the visit tell them youre not open to reconsidering this at this time because you feel its been working well and you believe the relationship has been improving with these sorts of boundaries in place
you need a sensible lawyers advice on other ways to think about this 

its totally reasonable for her to want to feel she is building equity and is fully invested but a 5050 split is probably not going create the best overall living situation for the both of you 

the other way forward it to start shopping in your price range when my partner and i began i was the lower earned and he was keen on 5050 when he saw the reality of what a place that was 5050 looked like as opposed to a place that was split based on income 6535 he rapidly changed his mind she may also change her mind if confronted with the real limits of her budget as opposed to our budget or you may be the one to change your mind and see other opportunities to invest capital besides your primary home
you werent rude and id have been rude sooner i just say please dont touch me ideally loud enough for others to hear clearly and less in the tone of pretty please and more in the tone of wtf you think youre doing i will break you fingers

nothing good has ever come of letting someone touch me twice 

hints are for people who are being nice randos with their hands on me arent nice and i dont have be nice back we aint in kindergarten anymore you keep your damn hands to yourself

i mean i dont wish harm on anyone and they would be out of the dating pool in theory

guy once asked me to read moon is a harsh mistress cause it was so formative for him i did when asked what i thought i said the pacing was horrible and i was deeply concerned by the books attitudes towards woman as supporting cast members in mens lives and that stranger in a strange land was a far far better book overall 

dont tell a 20something intellectual that youve read more heinlein than they have and you have some notes
she says in the op she is in therapy and that all the miscarriages were in the last year 

it strains credulity to imagine he was unaware of all of those miscarriages and the therapy appointments but sure suppose its possible
sure how could any other adult human being be expected to imagine that three miscarriages including a secondtrimester one which has op seeking therapy might be impacting her emotional state right now how absurd of us to expect an adult partner to maybe ask her if shes ok tell her its totally understandable if she has a lot of big feels say shit like well be in together no matter what happens or even im proud of you and well get through this instead of telling her shes not being nice enough to him and considerate enough of his feelings

s

for fucks sake men have us so conned i dont think op is handling this perfectly but the idea that hes incapable of better is embarrassing very few men are as stupid and incompetent as they like to pretend to be when not getting what they want

there doesnt seem to be a problem here  except possibly you realize just how much labour will be involved in maintaining completely separate finances while moving towards a more and more joined life

modern chivalry is just called consideration 

its concerning anyone is still clinging a philosophy that boiled down to stop raping and thieving so much just cause you have the swords youre upsetting the poors
you cant control other peoples reactions 

most peoples friends and family dont want to know details about their sex life 

it is risky to speak to a friend about something like this for a first time you have to make the choice based on what you know about the individual people here arent going to be able to help you much with that rando opinions on reddit definitely arent going to help
he only noticed this because of his asian fetish

if you watch any busy sidewalk for 10 mins youll see the vast majority of young women yield to men of all ages unless there is a walker or stroller involved most women yield and most men claim their space in public

you can find lots of anecdotal stories out there from women who decided to stop yielding and moving out of the way for others and they all say the same thing women moved to avoid them men knocked into them its a fun experiment if you can put up with some bruising google manslamming
bisexuals can be lovely loyal parters

bisexuals can also be cheating gaslighting assholes

you know which one youre dealing with
thats called dating 

for everyone 100 matches you get maybe 10 conversations for every 100 conversations maybe 10 dates for every 10 first dates maybe one second date 

there doesnt need to be anything wrong with you dating is hard and most people you meet with you wont click with these women are doing you a favor please stop assuming they are being unfair or stupid they arent 

and youre not really all that into these women either youre just bent out of shape because they got to do the rejecting let go of that bullshit and recognize that this is going to take a larger time commitment and more effort if you want to find a serious relationship
there are lots of idiots on reddit who dont think men should have feelings or normal human vulnerabilities or sentimentalities best to just ignore their trolling
id bet youre right she was likely taught this in therapy

standins or proxies like this are a tool therapists will sometimes suggest to help people  and not just children  communicate or signal they are ready to communicate about difficult things

while i wouldnt enjoy it its not necessarily unhealthy i wouldnt be overly concerned about it but you should be able to ask her questions about this tool and how it works for her and express discomfort if you have any

in an ideal world she would have discussed this technique with your prior to implementing it in your relationship but its possible that its so natural and normal to her she didnt realize it would be strange for someone else to be on the receiving end of it for the first time
yeah and i believe arnolds son with maria shriver did choose to work out moredifferently and change his look later on in life there is no bodyshaming here guy on the right just looks like a normal human being and not someone who is necessarily pursuing a career as an action movie star which is what is happening
in the image above the child he had with the housekeeper and hid is the one on the left the data was already wrong and  they held the charts upside down
they didnt arnold had a child with the housekeeper and hid it from the rest of his family for over a decade
and he held the charts upside down
biology and his own ignorance about the impact of miscarriages and grief have isolated him you didnt do it to him hes a full participant in this dynamic and he is not putting in the work to address it

try to open up to him about your fears and stress explain to him that while his optimism and happiness is lovely for him it can be exhausting work for you to both manage your complex feelings and your body and also be made responsible for addressing his feelings in the way he enjoys most

you would benefit from being more open with him but he also needs be a much safer and more empathetic person to be open with your feelings are valid and you will not always have the bandwidth to take care of his too he needs to do better and recognize the actual valid emotional complexity of this situation for you he cannot just steamroll you with me me meing
and it wasnt like at all what happened
but the one who was raised by the mother is the buff one in the left arnold didnt acknowledge him until he was publicly shamed into it when the kid was like 14 

it was the dude on the right who was raised by arnold for fucks sake maria shriver is standing right behind him and also fuck that noise hes not a movie star so he doesnt to do the work to look like one me neither
howd you get ask her how shes feeling from constant texting and asking if im going to leave him

hes a bully being insecure or confused doesnt make you not also a bully
have you talked about it

it doesnt seem completely unreasonable as neither of you appears to have planned sex into the equation 

i think its actually an important stage in a couples relationship when you can spend time together without having sex but given the whole context of this ldr this is a thing you need to talk about and you need to do it before you leave its not fair to either of you to carry this anxiety and not attempt to resolve it and understand one another while youre together
if you want to date paul your friendship with jay is probably over

you dont always get everything you want outta life jays feelings may not be rational but hes entitled to them and hes not obligated to be your friend or pretend to be your friend if he is not able to be at peace with your choices
youre making some bad choices most people are gonna think that after youre caught having sex with a teenager in a public parking lot and its a reasonable thing to think

you may not mean to but at 25 you should be aware that 18yearolds are not responsible partners for you even casually it says a concerning thing about your character and your sense that you didnt know that every 40yearold dating an 18yearold says they are pretty mature as well  thats not a reasonable argument of course they are its not about them its about what it says about you

the fact there are also sexist assumptions about different age gaps when the genders or sexuality is different is also not a reasonable argument for your particular situation youre making poor choices to get involved sexually with an 18 year old your expectations and needs in any sort of relationship even a fwbs one should be pretty damn different from an 18yearolds

while you do not owe anyone any answers to their questions about your sex life those people who know youre fucking at 18 year old are not obligated to like it and are allowed to think poorly of you for it
this man is trash and hes bringing out the absolute worst in you

go make better choices with someone better
there is no magic sequences of words that perfectly control how another person feels

i gave you the script below do that 

id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that
you ask because you were worried it would sound accusatory

dude
if its something important to you that would make you feel more comfortable and secure with your contraceptive plan and sex life with her yes 

that doesnt mean there is no risk of her reacting poorly  the risk does exist but its a reasonable thing to ask and itd be good to know if shes not a reasonable person about it
they dont happen randomly you do have to be exposed to them the t means transmitted but many people are asymptomatic and dont know they have any of them

your request for an sti test is reasonable it doesnt mean you dont trust her its just a better safe than sorry sort of situation for you both before you continue with barrierfree sex
she would have symptoms if she had an std

this is literally the worst most wrongheaded medical advice you could have possibly offered 

your first example chlamydia can be asymptomatic for years
thats exactly how you do it

id feel most comfortable at this stage in our relationship if we both got sti tests whadday think of that

you dont have perfect control over her reactions but you know your request is reasonable and thats the way to say it
its not too much

but if you want to be clear send him a very very short and very cold message that says something like this contact is unwanted do not send me any more communications in any channel or form if you do the next person who explains to you why this is not acceptable with be a police officer
break up

you are not bringing the security and respect to this relationship that is absolutely necessary for it to be a healthy one for either of you

either speak to a therapist to do the work by yourself because its all your work to make peace with the reality of women as full human beings with inherent value regardless of thier sexual past or break up and find a relationship that doesnt trigger the worst parts of your character in this way

there isnt a lot of great advice here man this is a you problem either you fix it or you dont if you dont wont or cant then you end this relationship and relationship where you fail to respect your partners past
those absolutely can be emotionally abusive things to say especially if he doesnt take accountability for them makes it your job to resolve his violations and continues the behavior 

have you considered this man might have a lot more experience masking his really shitty behaviour than you do seeing through this sort of manipulation

people dont generally date 10 years younger than them because they are looking for a balanced respectful relationship between equals

we forgive people for mistakes we dont forgive people for actively creating and maintaining a relationship where they get to treat us like shit whenever it pleases them to do so
seems like shes been pretty clear and consistent

if you still have feelings then you need to end or really minimize this contact

shes not respecting your boundaries and leaving you confused and hurting that isnt a friendship that is working out for you you can try to be clear again we cannot be friends if you keep joking about having sex with me after ive asked you to stop or you can just take the big step back right now
tell him you are beaking up tell him you dont want any further contact its not a conversation or a discussion there is no closure just tell him what is happening and then do it

block him on everything start recording any violations of the block so you can have the cops or other adults explain the situation if he continues to try to reach you and bully you

refuse delivery on anything he has sent if you cannot dont acknowledge it

a breakup isnt a negotiation and hes not being kind hes being a shitty little bully cut him out entirely and dont feel badly about removing someone from your life who doesnt respect you when you speak
eh its pretty good so far

good luck with it if you can learn try to be kind to yourself and others even when youre disappointed and frustrated youll have a way better and easier time of it too
do you actually want to marry this guy

cause it sounds like youre looking for reasons to label him not good enough after four years together and saying yes you should know who youre marrying and you should know if he knows you and listens to your needs and expectations well enough
you and most people usually keep on trying a bit longer than it makes any sense id say walk away now but you probably arent going too 

so my advice would be to stop when you find yourself resenting her and making unfairunreasonable judgments about her character just because shes not giving you what you want 

the best thing to learn is that its okay to just break up with someone a good person who just isnt good for you dont give into the urge to turn them into a bad bad person in your own head before you give yourself permission to walk away from a pretty good person who is just not a pretty good person for you that will save you a lot of drama and stress in life if you learn to stop and walk before you demonize someone who has done nothing really except disappoint you
it sounds like youre just not feeling secure and compatible

thats not really about texting

its a month in you shouldnt be using words like expectations and accommodating with these heavily negative connotations so early on this just isnt working for you stop trying to turn her into a monster in your own head before youre willing to admit this just isnt working for you
you need to calm the fuck down

not everyone engages with text the same way thats actually not all generational even among the same generation different people have different patterns and priorities

its okay to express what you need and want but youve known her long enough now to suspect that her preferred method of communication is inperson that doesnt make her evil or even disinterested it makes her different the fact you are jumping to the assumption shes lying or gameplaying is a red flag  on you

in the short term ask her if a 2030 minute video call between dates or a phone call would work for her it might help you feel connected your feelings do need to be addressed if this connection is gonna work out  but mostly by you not all by her  and bring them down like 8 notches and recognize that her norms around texting are also totally valid there is nothing not proper about her choice not to stalk you on social media all the time you want to talk about your shooting then talk to her as a person not a follower or audience member stop it with the nasty assumptions about her character because shes not reading your mind and serving your texting preferences
your girlfriend is accurately understanding that 17 is very different from 22 and is kicking herself for an error in judgment she made years ago this is not about the legal age of consent this is about her own standards for herself and her belief she didnt meet them

the best thing you can do is be honest with her about feeling empowered and free to choose in the relationship and accept the fact that just because she feel guilt or thinks she made a mistake doesnt mean the relationship was or is broken now 

stop trying to tell her it wasnt that bad thats not gonna work instead tell her you admire how she has set out to respect you and value you despite the age difference and that you dont want this mistake that you dont necessarily agree was a mistake but can respect she does to damage the great relationship you have now nine years later as equals
the only person who can offer any particular helpful explanations is her and shes not doing that shes said no to speaking to a doctor or therapist who could help her do that you dont get to know right now

of course pregnancy hormones could be impacting her but if she wont speak to a doctor about her emotional state then there is nothing you can do about that

it really sounds like youre looking for ways to make her change back and that isnt going to work you can only address the things shes doing and saying to you and what youre willing to accept in the friendship

stop trying to change her admit it when you cannot support her or accept her negativity telling her that isnt leaving her in the dark place not telling her the truth is abandoning her and will leave her more confused and hurt that her longtime friends dont want to talk to her anymore at least give her the respect of telling her why youre withdrawing from these conversations  cause she already knows youre not happy with her and youre withdrawing from her
i require monogamy sexual exclusivity in a partner

put it to him that plainly we all have fantasies and crushes you cannot do everything or everyone in life you want too

if you do not want an open relationship of any kind say so clearly and firmly if you never want a threesome or never with this particular woman hes been crushing on for ages say so directly

your boyfriend and immature and craves validation its not the sort of guy id want to even have an open relationship with to be honest openness and nonmonogamy requires way more selfawareness consideration and rationality than hes displayed here so far
you dont have to be friends with someone you dont want to be friends with

i agree you need to support your spouse through grief but i think you need to stop assuming you have perfect insight into their marriage if you cant support her in this just admit that and opt out
besides the incident with the xanax the rest of this sounds like she is rather legitimately angry with an inconsiderate husband and boundarybusting inlaws 

you should admit that her concerns and the intensity of her feelings are way beyond what you can help her with as a friends and encourage her to speak to a therapist or counsellor  you cannot give her the support shes looking for 

stop trying to calm her down tell her shes right that sucks and you dont know how to help if shes thinking of divorce and feeling that angry that often she should talk to a mental health professional she needs and deserves that support
youre not equiped to be in a longterm committed relationship

do not have a fling be an adult and break up if youre not interested in the same sort of committed relationship agreement that your gf is
talk to your husband you need to let him in on this struggle youre having

hell probably tell you exactly what im going to tell you if he hasnt already this man is not your friend hes never been your friend that was never his intention hes your hostagetaker he doesnt value your friendship he values the illusion of intimacy including some lowkey sexual intimacy that he is manipulating and obligating you to perform for him

regardless of what your husband says i would tell your friend that your husband has seen his comments about divorce and his compliments and your husband is insisting this is inappropriate and that you need to end the friendship then you can block him you can apologize but say you need to focus on your marriage its not totally untrue and you can ignore any future contact unless you need to call 911 to go make sure hes no dead

men have a very bad habit of respecting other mens property rights over their wives and girlfriend more than they respect those actual women when they speak when a man is treating me poorly i will happily use this misogyny against him to make him stop abusing my kindness
while i agree her behaviour is imperfect there is something to be said for being more aggressive in group settings if the norm in the group includes dominant or fastpaced talkers like your gf

your gf should be willing to moderate her behaviour however shes not solely responsible for your feelings of alienation its also on you to come up with your own strategies for handling that

it might mean turning and starting another oneonone conversation i do this a lot in groups where one person tends to dominate i see if i can start a second quieter conversation with one other person its not a play you can see if someone else will engage with you while the louder person is lecturing the group it also might mean asking other people questions about things your gf does not know details about it might mean introducing a topic of conversation where you have more to say than your gf does

your gf is in the wrong but this is also part of her nature that probably is never going to be completely resolved to your personal preferences and shes not the only one who needs to be a part of the solution here talking to her about the steps youre taking to feel more included in group conversations might even help give her some small things she can do to support you instead of making it all her job to make you feel included

if the problem persists then you might be fundementally incompatible but id address this first as something you need to change your approachtactics on not something she has to gift you
youre willfully ignorant of your own behaviours and feelings and of how those behaviours will be reasonably experienced by others and probably struggle to say simple things like im concerned or im feeling confused about the boundaries with this dude

communication is gonna be rough good luck with it
where in the post did i say it was the third or fourth time ive said this

i didnt say it was i said especially if was this the first time you brought it up think again was it really the first time you expressed negative feelings towards her coworker and this friendship do you really think she wasnt picking up on your feelings toward him earlier than this possible not likely

asking how close she is with someone isnt an insult at all

dude this shit just doesnt work you cannot be willfully ignorant of the subtext and think its gonna work out well 

give yourself a smack up the head and be honest about your own shit she reasonably felt attacked because you did attack her behaviours instead of owning and acknowledging your own feelings of discomfort or concerns feelings which were valid and you could have expressed without the but im just asking questions bullshit games

it was an accusation not a question you knew it she knew it what you meant to say was im uncomfortable and instead you said im too much of a chicken shit to talk about my valid concerns and feelings so im going to imply youre doing something bad and try to force your to justify and defend yourself instead of having an open conversation about your feelings too

you probably dont mean to be gaslighting but is what youre getting at youre trying to obligate her to pretend youre being nice when you both know youre accusing her of wrongdoing

what you need to do can do and should do is acknowledge youre not comfortable with this friendship that is valid that doesnt mean shes done any monstrously wrong it just means youre not comfortable and that can and should be addressed baseless shady accusations dressed up like their innocent questions  yeah that shit pisses people off
this is already a breakup 

stop prolonging your suffering stick the break up and end all contact
16 male and 19 female subjects

that is not meaningful support for the idea they women can detect facial symmetry in body odour this is not how girls work not on the basis of this study

oddly enough the thing that seems to be brushed right past here is that the strongest correlation in this 25yearold very small study was actually the men smelling the pretty ladies the smell of the women was rated by men as sexier the more attractive their faces these few men could sniff out a pretty face apparently the womens responses to the scent of the men were way more nuanced and less clear
this would also require op actually talking about his actual feelings 

im concernedim feeling insecurei have questions about boundaries and not opening up with thinly veiled insults like so how close are you

you need to trust me to select my own friends isnt a totally fair response to i feel insecure but its a totally valid response to baseless accusations especially if its the third or fourth time youve heard em
you came to her with your concerns and she told you whats up

keeping on coming at her with this over and over again is telling her that you think shes a liar and cannot be trusted to select her own friends or maintain boundaries with them

if thats what you think of her dont date her

if you want to talk about your feelings and have them acknowledged then go ahead and talk about your feelings a conversation about your feelings doesnt open with obvious judgement and accusatory language like how much do you two still talk and just how close are you two it starts with im feeling insecure about the level of contact im seeing can we talk about boundaries with this new friend and make sure were on the same page i need some reassurance if youre feeling vulnerable or concerned or would like different boundaries to be matinained say so talk about that but dont expect her to play conveniently stupid for you when she knows shes being directly insulted and judged not being asked to have a conversation about how youre feeling
spoken like a person who has never once been at risk of being labelled that upright b who just cannot take a joke in the office

there are reasons to let shit slide you dont have to agree with her choices but it can be extremely hard and risky for young women in workplaces to draw those boundaries we cannot afford to go around picking those fights needlessly with the rude men around us because there are real fights that are real risks that might need all our capital to address preferring to laugh it off is a perfectly normal response
16 male and 19 female subjects

haha yeah no 

it really only supports what we already know  women who are ovulating are more sensitive to body odour then women who are not a lot of women could have told you this themselves if youd bothered asking
i think this is far too fast but that doesnt really matter very much

whats the plan for the talk how do you imagine that conversation going with her are you trying to ask her if this is working for her are there things youre worried about for yourself youre not getting in this arrangement
this probably wasnt about your erection

it is exceedingly unlikely she thought about it a tenth as much as you are right now

i know you dont want to believe that because youre feeling wounded and insecure but the worst thing you can do for your longterm happiness is let this anxiety fester youre never going to know for sure but it probably wasnt about that

it was three weeks of a willtheywontthey between two longtime friends and she tapped out that was actually the most likely outcome regardless of what happened with your penis most of those connections fizzle out most of the time one or both people decide nope actually there is a reason were friends and not more

youre never going to know for sure you probably wont believe her if she tells you but the facts are

1 sometimes the body and brain arent in alignment and its rarely as big a deal for women as men assume it is its normal it happens it doesnt matter much the most annoying part about it for most women is that the guy gets really emotionally worked up about it 
2 very often the person we have romantic feelings for doesnt share them

these two facts rarely have anything to do with one another
you need to learn to say no fullsentence no excuses just no 

your mother can stand outside the door until your siblings let her in its important that you make your mother suffer under their bad behavior as well as she is the one with more power to actually correct it 

you also need to speak to your mother about some transparency into the household finances you are an adult and its not safe or responsible if she is the only one who knows how the lights get kept on what if something happens to her its way past time for her to share the budget and basic details with you if she expects you to keep contributing and living in this home as a 30 year old she might not be deliberately mistreating you but shes also not setting her adult children up for success by keeping them totally ignorant
not your circus not your monkeys

block him everywhere and move on with your life
id just find it so immature that my adult partner was spending so much time pornscrolling on socials its not about trust or control its about wanting to to be dating an adult who doesnt sink hours of their day into mindlessly thirsting

by all means enjoy consensually and ethically created porn but obsessively using ig that way is just so what a 12yearold in 2013 would do yuck
hah my ex was the same way 

he ended it but clearly believed hed be able to bully me and watch me suffer because he made 23x more than me told me to my face that i had stalled his life and couldnt afford to live without him we were both a bit shocked to discover that i had significantly more money in savings his refusal to be transparent about finances was a huge part of the breakdown he liked to be the man who decided and who paid for everything and then hold it over my head that i wasnt contributing to the plans hed made alone 

immediately he decided i must have taken advantage of him  after years of refusing to talk about money with me as if i was an adult and a partner  instead of recognizing he had terrible habits he was hiding from me and i didnt benefit from in the least
then im not sure why you asked if hes a potential rapist kinda six of one half a dozen of the other at that point isnt it not a question of is he violent just which kind of violence to classify it as in court
yes you just had a man tell you hes a violent criminal in search of an excuse

if he hasnt actually behaved like a violent criminal yet its only because he doesnt feel hes found a good enough excuse but hes definitely on the look out for one
i made a similar choice my ex made it clear he didnt want an agreement he wanted to fight over every penny in court and there just werent enough pennys involved to bother extending his presence in my life even that much oddly the person who was most angry with my choice was my own father hes not a woke guy by any means but my dad was the one who felt most strongly that my ex has stolen my labour and dodged his responsibilities after 10 years together 

everyone says women go for every penny but i never met the woman who went to the mat for anything except the children in her care and even then i know a few who said it wasnt worth the drama
its absolutely a thing people believe 

it doesnt matter how often you point out to them that divorce almost always leaves a woman less financially secure than marriage does especially if they have children

the vast majority of women who choose divorce are choosing to be seriously poorer than they were before some of them know damn well theyre choosing poverty 

far too many men just cannot accept that poverty is better than living with them or but raising children is extremely expensive and yes it actually is still your job even when the mom stops fucking you if you dont like that take it up with capitalism not the custodial parent
the simple argument is that the cats are going  thats the plan any disruption to their patterns right now just means its more likely the cats wont be successfully trapped relocated shes not getting rid of the cats by messing with the current situation  shes making it more likely theyll stick around after youre gone  

but she wont listen to reason 

more realistically you should just speak to your landlord and neighbours about someone else taking on the feeding you have other more pressing responsibilities to your own safety at the moment and eliza is far less likely to target the cats if they arent seen as yours 

if have a neighbour network and resources of support for these cats use it dont be a lonely saint let the village do what a village does and focus on what you need to do to get yourself a safe living environment
let him know that youre not interested in datingseeing anyone else youre enjoying this connection and focused on it 

it is going to be a bit early for some people but you should always ask for what you need in any sort of relationship at any stage 

and its never too early to be honest about what choices youre making for yourself and to ask them what they thnk about that
hes told you who he is

youve told him you wont live with that person

you are stuck until you decide your own future is more important than coasting and being comfortable with him right now a guy you cant ever live with
if calling you slurs and keeping you feeling insecure in the relationship is a vital freedom he requires to express his true character then hes not the funny guy 

hes the guy who has learned how to mask his malice and contempt behind humour
the one that is always stayed with me is from a long time ago i was about 19 i was riding public transit and there was a man who wouldnt stop talking to me and was trying to physically box me in i had moved seats twice and i was at the stage i was just trying to ignore him and was too scared hed follow me if i got off the bus which would be even worse than being on the bus where at least there were witnesses even if they were pretending not to notice 

i was seriously starting to panic when these two much much older ladies started shouting at me annie is that you come here and sit with us annie and demanded i take the seat between them they spent the next two or three stops winking at me and talking so loudly between the two of them about annie and how lovely it was to run into annie and how annie absolutely had to get off at their stop and have a cup of tea with them so i did and he slunk off and didnt follow us
i think you have the right idea to focus on life stages thats the big gap between them and it wont disappear for nearly a decade 

you may also do what my mother did and remind  her its the fact she wonderful and mature that will make her an object of interest to men older than her including those are using her positive characteristics to mask their negative ones my mother was addressing a much larger and more obviously predatory age gap when she said that but it always stuck with me that she explained id be selected by this sort of older men because i was defensibly mature presenting not because i was naive because i was smart and wonderful not because i was a pushover because i was inexperienced not i was dumb
in broad terms yes we could get more specific but youve basically got it

we cannot always control what were attracted  too but we can control and challenge the false stories and stereotypes we believe about the kinds of individuals we find sexually appealing

to get along with people you must remember theres a difference between a story or a fantasy or role that we might enjoy sexually and an actual unique individual person who may have a feature or characteristic we associate with that story in our heads

dating involves a lot of rejection it just does but if you cant deal with the individual person in front of you and separate them from the sexual object fantasy in your head about petite women youre gonna get rejected a lot more
yes basically honestly thats pretty impressive youve understood what people are telling you 

and its not a terrible problem a lot of us have stories about what we see attracted too that are flawed or fetishizing to some degree but it is an error and its not going to be fair to every individual woman and since you only date individual women you need to be aware of your biases and your stories and your illogical beliefs about women  and keep them under control  when you speak to individual women otherwise many of them wont like you or trust you

if people feel that youre forcing them into a particular sexual role or dynamic just because you like their kind of body and associate it with your fetishizing a lot of people wont like that

a preference for blond hair is different from preferring blonde hair because you thinks blondes are more carefree and fun the first is fine the second is a false story many blonde women will not enjoy having forced on them
nope you got that backwards and its gonna get you into trouble youre fetishizing small women because youre attracted to a story about weakness and softness they arent inherently more feminine and therefor you are attracted to them you are attracted to them so you call them feminine

a little more self awareness will help you with actual woman and not just chasing a fantasy fulfilment none of the women i know who youd call feminine would want anything to do with you if you cannot tell the difference between the story in your head about pretty little princess and the real full human being they actually are even when they wear pretty dresses
id worry a bit less about being polite and focus a bit more on being clear being clear doesnt mean being mean the clear honest communication is that you reasonably believe she gave it to your brother because she decided she didnt like your choice  and is now purposefully lying to you about that which only deepens the violation and hurt dont ask her to do anything just say i know you did x i reasonably believe you did y and are lying about it now i am hurt and angry

you dont have to not be angry or bitter this is a legitimate thing to be pissed about it does feel like crap nothing is going to make this better even getting the oil back from your brother is probably gonna feel like a rather empty victory

you probably shouldnt go back to the good relationship that you felt you had right after you got back that was temporary and not fully true hell the fact it was good for a while may be why she felt she could get away with this violation relationships arent static but you should try to stop telling yourself the kind of stories that are going to make you angry for longer the fact you have some awesome travel stories is more valuable in the long term than the oil dont let your mother take even more away from you than the oil or poison other parts of your life and memories
you offered to do this if you were anxious about the exchange you need to at least express that to him hes not wrong or evil to accept your offer of a favour at face value 

if you leave your partner thinking youre happy enough to do something for them your partner might just assume youre happy enough to do it 

if youre upset by a pattern of being inconsiderate or taking your assistance for granted then that is a thing to discuss with him but as youve written it here this is a bad example of anything besides him definitely not being a mindreader
you cannot fix this for other people

you can tell them kindly but firmly that youre drawing a boundary on these emails in your life and that includes even their responses to them you cannot let this harm in

if they continue to respond to these chains youre going to need to block them too and theyll need to reach out via text message or phone call if they want to contact you

tell them you absolutely respect their choice to engage and fight but this isnt the context in which you are willing to engage with your uncle or his ideas encourage them to take similar steps to protect themselves from harm if and when they deem it necessary

direct conflict with this sort of person rarely works be empathetic with your family who is hurting but be clear about your own boundaries on these behaviours if you want these email chains out of your life get them out of your life
technically possible but extremely almost absurdly unlikely like baby grand piano falling out of a passing plane overhead and crushing your mailbox unlikely all those things technically exist and so could possibly happen but almost certainly will not dont lose sleep this time

please use another method if you dont want to be pregnant this is how you get pregnant
its good that youve been able to improve your relationship with your mother but perhaps its time to also manage your expectations and your responses instead of trying to change her choices

by all means tell her how her actions have impacted your and your relationship but expecting her to get the oil back is just a further escalation that is a unlikely to happen anyways and a bit unfair to the poor sod she dragged into this and b doesnt actually solve the problem

tell her how the behaviour impacted you let her figure out what shes going to do about that likely nothing and allow this experience to inform your choices and boundaries in the future with her perhaps store the rest of the oil in your own space
two things

the first is that this is just called compatibility compatibility is difficult and rare its good that you are able to see the difference between valuing someone as a friend and wanting to pressure a romanticsexual connection thats a great thing a lot of people dont have figured out 

the second is to reconsider how much you engage with or centre your fetish in your life a lot of smaller women will not appreciate being fetishized like this in fact your attitudes towards them will make you incompatible with a fair number of them if youve ended up with a bit of a mental deathgrip syndrome where you are only sexually interested in one very particular kind of dynamic or body type then you probably want to try to expand your taste and stop hyperfocusing you have trained your body and mind to only respond to one thing as sexy and thats not necessarily gonna lead you to the most happiness
youre 32 youve been sharing a home with this other adult for years you should absolutely expect your husbands support but not his blind service to personal boundaries that you will not even speak up about yourself

it is hard i understand that but youre demanding work from your husband when you wont do your share you also owe it to your husband to also put the work in its not fair to make this emotional and interpersonal labour all his job to perform you make you both look foolish when youre not able to simply say bil this shoulder patting just doesnt work for me please dont do it flinching or shrugging is not sufficient communication
have you expressed this to your brotherinlaw

while i agree your husband should support you he shouldnt have to speak for you 

youre not mute youre not a confused child or any other sort of incompetence with this

you should be able to say bil please dont do that i dont like it it doesnt make me feel the affection youre trying to express it just makes me uncomfortable

then your husband should support you its shouldnt be all his job to express your boundaries to someone else anyone else
they probably believed they were okay with it too they might still believe that they probably arent trying to lie to you but you have to make your choices based on whether or not what they do works for you as a partner not just what they believe  good luck
professionals are just people even a pro quarterback making millions a year makes a few truly bad plays you can always be a bit skeptical of a single professionals opinion especially when its on someone who isnt even in the room
you are poly and asexual your partner is not really okay with either of those things

leaving aside the other behaviours  which all sound more immature to me than malicious  youre just fundamentally incompatible leaving the relationship would be wise
based on what youve said here exceedingly unrealistic

if your partner has behaviours or patterns that are making you uncomfortable discuss those with her 

and im concerned your therapist didnt correct their massive error prior to the end of the session seriously they set you off down a totally unproductive and even damaging path if i were you that is the relationship id be rethinking
of course you told your therapist more than this

but either your therapist is monstrously irresponsible or they were just a bit careless and didnt realize you were going to take way way more away from their comments than was halfway reasonable to do

its reasonable to recognize that her pattern of withdrawing or going into negative moods for a few days might be who she is  and not just a trauma response to her past relationship it is not at all reasonable for either of you to be trying to diagnose her as a narcissist that is calling someone an irredeemable abuser and liar the fact you had no concerns prior to the conversation with your therapist and then jumped to labelling them with npd is absurdly paranoid and suggests to me you might struggle with anxiety its worth remembering even a healthy person can sometimes display some narcissistic traits but that is entirely different from having npd or being a narcissist anyone who saw me drunk at my 30th birthday party could have observed a solid few narcissistic traits

to date is to risk being lied to either take the risk with open eyes or dont but dont fool yourself into thinking there is any perfect way to avoid manipulation in life there is not perfect system life is risk
yeah do that take him seriously and make him explain what is funny about calling you an evil predatory person who wants to hurt sick people
no sarcasm no bullshit take him dead seriously

ouch thats hurtful  
  
im just joking  
  
its funny to call me an evil person who wants to hurt others  
  
no its not  
  
great then quit it

if hes your friend hell take note if he wants to be a jealous jerk more than he values your friendship well youll find out
your therapist sounds deeply irresponsible

dont date someone you feel this insecure about dont date someone if you do not trust them do not date someone if you are not comfortable with how they handle their past experiences or conflict with you

dont see a therapist who diagnoses someone who isnt even in the room based on the story you tell in a single session

dont you go diagnosing someone via google

no one knows if this woman is mentally ill or a narcissist based on what youve shared here if youre giving your gf leeway on behaviours you would rather not accept in a partner address that or end the relationship doesnt suit you
you need to block her that is what no contact really means

she is going to keep on circling back either out of boredom curiosity or a desire for attentionvalidation

it is sad her cousin is in trouble but youre not her support network thats not a thing you can address youre an ex an ex who requested no contact youre not friends

stop letting this person pick at your wounds for their own sake
i can see youre really trying to come at this from a good and kind place but i think a bit of a reality check

this is not just grief this is also a bad manager

youre describing some very toxic management behaviours that were almost certainly present prior you were just in the first few months of a honeymoon period of a new gig and you hadnt seen your bosss weaknesses yet all bosses have some youre describing some particularly bad ones open contemptlack of respect focused on blaming not solutions isolating employees to retrain control emotionally manipulative

and this is your managers fault and your managers managers fault if they need to take leave because they cannot perform and treating people with respect and managing communication with the team are performance issues for a manager then they need to actually take leave and the daytoday responsibilities need to be addressed by someone else

there is not much you can do but recognize this this behaviour is not okay it may have escalated recently due to grief but it is probably not brand new if your company is at all healthy then your managers manager is aware of the performance issues doesnt mean theyll do anything about it but they likely know 

stop trying to figure out how to address your bosss feelings and start focusing on how to navigate your workplace and responsibilities from the perspective that you have a really shitty boss right now maybe they werent always shitty but id bet they always had these weaknesses and maybe they wont always be this way but right now they are your boss and they are really really bad at it the strategies you need to learn are how to work for a bad boss
ditch him

i dont fuck men who tell me they are skeptical about my gender identity or sexuality i used to try to be chill with the whole youre probably a lesbian really or i cannot believe youre really bi but no fuck that noise you can believe me when i speak if you dont we dont fuck
oh maybe this is just a reading comprehension issue and not a legal theory one
apparently not im not a lawyer either but i imagine any actual legal training might even get in the way of said knowledge
youre a lawyer

its shitty to have sex in your own living room while your roommate is also passed out in said living room but its not banging on a swing set behind the grade school

itd be funny to hear the talking to op would get if they actually called 911 because they woke up a few feet from their roommate hooking up
she shouldnt be including people in her kink without their consent and if you want a no sex in common area rule then just speak up and say so its a totally reasonable rule ive always explicitly had it with all my roommates no sex in shared areas like living roomsbathrooms 

if she wont agree to that reasonable rule then youre going to need to move

but realize the rule is not really all that enforceable rule if your style as roommate includes getting so drunk that you regularly pass out in common areas she is still in the wrong but i think you should bring your anger down several notches tell her what you need to be comfortable in the shared area of the home and for the sake of the friendship file this under a misunderstanding of one another boundaries
leaving your wife of 17 years with two kids involved probably gonna require a conversation
i cant confront her about it because it would reveal that i checked her phone which would be a huge breach of trust that could ruin our relationship

op said he risked his marriage he should know

piling on her is some self righteous fun times for internet randos but shes not here op is op needs to talk to his damn wife
if youre ready to walk away from this relationship then walk

trying to force his parents not to invite her to easter was foolish at the very least trying to change his mothers traditions for who she includes at family dinners was out of line and plainly stupid of you you picked a very specific fight  with his mother through him  which you were not going to win if you were serious about not attending with her then the actual boundary was just to let him know to send you regrets to his mothers and that youd be spending the holiday with your own family not to try to change the invite list thats not a boundary thats just being bratty and pushy with your bf of three months family that so was not a smart move 

but besides that your bf has been clear about his priorities and the boundaries he wants with her and they dont meet your needs stop fighting a war youve already lost and in the future dont try to pick fights with mothers over the guests they frequently invite into their own homes
a half a year of a break is just a breakup a chickenshit slowmoving break up 

he may not have been trying to fuck with your brain but he certainly didnt give a rats ass if he did at some point there is not much difference between this level of childish stupidity and selfishness and malice 

block him everywhere hes trash and youre good to be rid of him
dude youre almost 30 so yeah wise up love is not enough

for a single parent you also need to be compatible with the child and the family life the parent wants for the child your anxiety with the child and with her coparent after nine months of dating was a pretty reasonable dealbreaker for her to have it doesnt matter if the kid loves you the sorts of thoughts you were describing having about the child and the ex were toxic af

youre not compatible

you should probably avoid dating single parents its okay to not be good at it but its important to know that about yourself

this was my thought and i felt a bit bad about it this woman is gorgeous and has beautiful breasts they would probably change drastically if she tried to loose enough weight for a flat tummy look 

when i have less of a pouch i also have far less tits i like my stomach the most at about 135 lbs but i love my tits at 160 lbs
this would be a reaching a dealbreaker for me

my ex did this too compared me to toxic and abusive women he knew or had heard of when i expressed totally reasonable boundaries or feelings i sat quietly trying to talk to him about money while he compared me to a woman who had stabbed her husband talked to him about how he had insulted and undermined me in front of others and he compared me to a woman who had driven her husbands car into a tree to punish him 

i honestly didnt realize until that relationship was over how totally absurd this behavior was it was emotionally abusive and a silencing tactic basically anything i thought or felt that was inconvenient for him was crazy or toxic there was no way for me to say anything he didnt like without being treated like a potentially violent lunatic the issue wasnt how i said it the issue was he never ever want to have to listen to it
realistically if youve checked out of the relationship then youre almost certainly going to end up leaving and taking goober thats just the most likely outcome of what youve described here no matter how much you say you cannot do that

you do all the animal caretaking this relationship is going to end and youre going to end up taking the dog because youre the one whose life accommodates the dogs daily needs that is almost certainly what is going to happen the faster you and your bf admit to yourselves the better off all three of you will be

if you want to be sneaky about it start paying for all the vet care and dog food having the receipts will be a good idea if your bf tries to challenge the reality of this situation when you inevitably break up
some people are really bad at making choices or expressing those choices clearly to others for lots of reasons

most people are not consciously stringing anyone along they just dont know what they dont know they tell you the best truth theyve got at the time its on you to walk away if a relationship of any kind its not meeting your needs

this isnt about women or even really all that much about dating you can have totally similar communication issues and indecision dynamics with coworkers friends or family members

this is an advice sub so the advice is dating is hard most connections will not go anywhere women are human dont become bitter and resentful about women just because youre inclined to date human women
i cant imagine i would either but nothing about any of this gets addressed here until op talks to his damn wife
youve been advised to speak to your wife

youve been advised to stop this risky pinning for other womens attention and validation

youve been advised to increase your therapy sessions

take this over to rventing if you just need to type out your troubles over and over again youve been given all the sensible advice a person can get there is no magical answer that the internet is withholding from you the answer you dont like is the only answer
there is no way forward without revealing you checked her phone admitting wrongdoing aand asking her the questions that frighten you and dealing with the consequences you know it could be just friendly i use it with my sisters because we blow kisses all the time you also know it probably isnt just friendly and that at very least its a behaviour youre uncomfortable with 

sorry but im not buying your minimization here you know this snopping risks your marriage you have done this before and you will do it again this was not a onceoff youre checking up on her by violating her privacy thats the marriage youre in right now this is the marriage youre going to be in until you make different choices

play stupid  games win stupid  prizes

your current plan is gradeschoollevel shadethrowing youre a 40yearold guy with two kids do better talk to your wife
wildly

the cdc puts it at like 4363 for womenmen so 44x more whod have thought the cdc would be fooled
him and several other people not just the two of them 

pretty standard practice for young academics at conferences i snuck six of in once because money is tight and conferences are vital
exactly this

lob this grenade back into their home and tell them to sort their own shit and leave you out of it youre not the other woman in their shitty little drama
shes not the villain but she is treating op like shit because she cannot stand up for herself that is manipulative and childish 

she probably should feel insecure but that doesnt make it ops job to protect her from the reality of the man shes planning to marry
i wouldnt do it quite like this if op further enmeshes themselves and opens up the risk of debatenegotiation with a timeline threat if op is going to show mark the letter better to just do the thing rip the bandaid right off 

if op has an email for them both cc them both on the same email thank her for her message and say you absolutely understand her feelings and agree with her you absolutely will respect her wishes and not attend the wedding however you also will not lie to mark about the reason you are declining the invite 

and ask them to kindly not involve you further in any disagreement
where did they fuck

he kissed her once and op ended contact for months because it wasnt what she wanted at all

ill agree op isnt blameless but at this point shes just an inflatable bat these two morons are hitting each other with she didnt cause that mark and his fiance are telling this little drama tale and cast her in this bullshit role
it doesnt matter how wellwritten it is

what happened here is that this woman put op in an impossible position where no matter what op does she has to be the bad guy either she lies to a friend or she shows up when she knows shes uninvited all because this engaged woman cannot speak transparently and honestly with her fiance its manipulative bullshit being earnest about your manipulation and dishonesty doesnt change the core of the behaviour

if it were me id be livid with both of these people for putting me in this situation and send a photo of the letter to them both tell them of course i will not attend and to sort their shit out without involving me further

this friendship with mark is probably over because they are both a shitshow you should be opting out of anyways
you dont go you tell him youre absolutely 100 not going to go you understand her reasons and you agree with her that its best you dont attend 

and you show him the letter

its not okay for her to keep these secrets or burden you with them your loyalty is not to her its to him dont go to the wedding regardless tell him as much because of course you shouldnt go if the bride doesnt want you there but also dont let her turn you into her own dirty little secret thats not what you are you are his friend so you show him the letter

shes not protecting mark shes protecting herself she figured out a power to move to absolve herself and make you the bad guy no matter what you choose so choose friendship give him the truth wish him well stay the hell away from his wedding
i get missing that but really that should be resolvable by ya know i miss that every once and a while you damn better get outta bed and come down the hall for fun times

again i get being nervous about how this might change your patterns and dynamic but put your big girl pants on this is part of what getting older together looks like sort your shit out and stop talking about divorcing your husband because you might not be able to share a bed every night you must realize that is not the place to start this problem solving effort
you really cannot wrap your brain around having spontaneous sex but not in the hour right before you two go to bed

its not really that spontaneous if its only happening in the bedroom during the eveningnight is it thats sure not what spontaneous sex means to me 

youre 44 i get being nervous about this change but give your head a damn shake this is should be a fun problem to solve
youre not crazy

by all means wish the best for him

but also stop talking to him

take the win enjoy that final pleasant conversation and dont leave the door open to anymore more bullshit because as much as you may wish better for him its pretty damn unlikely hes any better yet if you let him back in even just a catchup occasionally odd are its not gonna keep on feeling that good

show kindness to yourself let go of the anger and of all contact youve gotten everything you need from this person already
experience of life matters

which is why he knows to keep his distance from any woman who has any
youre kidding yourself

like i understand why i know why youre going to keep trying to negotiate this but you are kidding yourself he is not ignorant he is skilled he may not be selfaware about it but he is skilled

he has a set of interpersonal tactics that work for him he has found that you are respective to these tactics when others would have reasonably cut off contact by now 

in every one of your responses you are describing a person with tactics to make you feel obligated to him and to be constantly extending the benefit of the doubt to him he violates your boundaries and then blames you for hurting his feelings because you didnt appreciate having your boundaries violated

he may not be fully conscious about what he is doing but he is fully aware of what works to make young women feel pressured to keep being nice to him when he is not being nice at all
you need to crush this guy for your own sake and his 

he absolutely sees the gift as niceness coins that can he can use to make you feel obligated to give him what he wants or tolerate his other poor behaviours 

stop assuming he doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing
youre dating someone who lies to you and is comfortable being with someone who is cheating on their wife 

your skill is not the problem here blow jobs are not the problem here this is not a religious hangup your gf is dishonest
how many times have you asked about this situation now im sure ive see it six or seen times so is it a dozen twenty times now

this is really not a healthy use of rrelationships at this point

youre not comfortable with this fwb arrangement if you were comfortable with it you wouldnt be posting repeatedly online looking for some sort of magical insight that is just not coming stop doing something youre not comfortable with or secure in if its fueling these sorts of questions and anxiety just stop

take your larger questions about life and relationships to a therapist and maybe stick to a vibrator for a while until youve got a better sense of your own desires and boundaries when it comes to others
lets be fair a silent bang maid he can verbally abuse without feedback or consequence
micah struck me from the get go as a situational mean girl still nasty as all hell but probably capable of selfcorrection if she made the active choice to break with her toxic friends and end those patterns shes a notverybright follower and people pleaser easily led happy to earn brownie points with the even nastier girls by playing the same game shes got no core not a lot actually going on

my youngest sister was like this as well she was a nasty piece of work with her tribe but she woke up the the dynamic when she was in her mid20s and decided to stop acting like a damn hyena got a few new friends and decided to try being basically decent to other people for a while 

micah is extremely immature for her age and i sure as shit wouldnt want to be her friend but i have some hope for her all the same
she may have thought you were joking your reaction was that ridiculous 

sometimes youre owed a swift kick in the ass dude and not a gentle pat on the head she should never have had to hold your hand through this
this is not a bid for connection 

leave her be
yeah i do think you can cultivate real friendships with men but its particularly tough at your age and its rare overall men are so encouraged to shoot their shot and see every woman in their life as a potential girlfriend if they are just persistent enough some never get past that nonsense assumption about the availability of women to their desiresneeds but some do

trouble is ya just never know which is which until you know
youre being absurd you utterly overreacted to her acting like a decent host

demanding an apology from him because she allowed him to use a room in her apartment to take an important call is the worst kind of toxic machismo bullshit youre basically broadcasting to him that you cannot handle his presence in her life and dragging him into your argument with her by taking that stand not okay your sense of possession of her space and the desire to pick a fight with him over this are huge red flags 

its not our space her space for a damn work call he needed a space apart from the group to take its not like she was giving him a lap dance while it happened or tossing her panties at him he needed a door that closed in most peoples apartments that is only the bedroom

if i was your gf id be frustrated with you too and resentful of your inability to manage your own feeling for a hot second and respect a perfectly reasonable decision if hes her friend then he is a friend she behaved like youd expect someone to for a friend

you were way off base you didnt need to be further heard you needed to get a grip

if youre not okay with her being friends with a past partner say that but if youre going to accept that this person is a friend then she gets to treat him like a friend
right there are a lot of not great options  because the whole thing is just not great  and there are some very bad options stalling until you are vacationing and putting it out there without warning is in my opinion a very bad option
exactly

and the goal here should be to rip it off before you reach peak misery and you snap and do it a totally thoughtless and likely antagonistic way

its never going to be not complicated the goal should just be to make the pain and confusion a little bit more manageable for you both
exactly it is stressful its not gonna be less stressful if you do it while in an unknown place where you have no separate corners to go to take a time out and you still have to figure out where the food is and what time you need to get to the airport it may suck to do on a weeknight but being on a trip is not gonna make this more successful unless shes agreed to use the time that way as well
you realize your behaviour here is weird right

you keep responding with what you dont want but are extremely vague on what you do want in this connection and what you are or are not getting from it you keep coldly reporting his situation and status in a way that sort of sounds like a list of grievances with him but you seem to refuse that framing as well its bizarre

if youre not comfortable with the fwb arrangement with him end it youre not his therapist or his support you dont have to be that to him just because you feel he is in need of it

if you want to date someone else do so your current list of other potentials is beside the point entirely if this fwb isnt working end it even if you dont have other great options at the moment youll live 

or maybe you really just need a vibrator for a while
i just told you im a rando online that is all i am to you thats all any of us are on reddit to you any other qualifications i might have in other aspects of my life do not apply to this exchange
im glad youre talking to your therapist about this and obviously their advice should trump randos online bit i do think that is bat shit crazy

your wife is going to feel entrapped and set up and neither of you will be able to retreat if you need too on the receiving end itll seem like you did all this work just to corner her into a really tough conversation personally i just cannot imagine a worse way to approach this than not to tell someone youre only taking them out of their space and routine so you can tell them youre miserable in the marriage

at least give her some warning that you want to have some serious conversations and reconnections during this trip let her walk into it with some informed consent
i know this is harsh but once a month is a vent session or maybe a way to address a distant issue like parental alienation or largely resolved past trauma this is the marriage youre in every day if youre not going once a week youre not going to see much progress on these sorts of issues 

there is no right moment you have to make a good enough moment before you snap and the moment becomes to urgent to avoid and it probably goes very badly 

and the good enough moment is not while travelling do not spring this on her for the first time while travelling that is an truly awful idea that will only further unbalance you both she will feel set up and she wont be wrong if this is part of your motive with all these plans you are setting her up all your work to create a gift or a meaningful time together will be spoiled if you leverage those possible moments of reconnection to instead trigger what you reasonably realize will be some conflect and youre setting yourself up for disappointment and epic failure with that plan travelling will not be the removal of barriers to this conversation it will be the removal of normalcy and safety and disruption of the patterns that actually allow for calm reconnection and thoughtfulness travelling is not the circumstances to have a difficult risky conversation within 

i cannot say this clearly enough that is a terrible plan please do not do that unless she has consented to some sort of couples retreat where she knows that conversation is a priority for this time do not do that
therapy

you need to speak to your wife and advocate for your own relationship that isnt rocket science but if your own insecurities and fears are further muddying these waters go talk to someone and get a bit more clarity to help you through these tough conversations

looking for validation outside of your marriage is an understandable impulse but you need to quash it and address the issues inside the marriage first and no i dont mean to just keep addressing them through further acts of service for your wife i mean addressing the fact that you are also a person with needs and feelings within the relationship and speaking up about the kind of marriage youd like build together
if you want to apologize apologize just apologize

what you should not do is demand more of her attention and emotional service to hear you out or patch things up if you want to apologize and admit wrongdoing then do just that and nothing else youre not entitled to trying to fix it you dont get to control her story about her own life all you can offer her fairly without her asking for more is a hundred words or so admitting you were wrong and that you understand that you hurt her and that you are sorry

if its more than about 100 words youre doing apologies wrong 

so no bullshit about your growth and maturity or anger issues treatment thats not her job to address or validate just i was wrong i hurt you i am sorry

if you want to try and rebuild a connection id strongly encourage you to speak to a therapist before you take any steps towards that if you want to apologize then just apologize without demands or expectations or excuses
im not able to say much because youre saying a whole lot of nothing what is your actual question youre just spinning yarns over and over again

what is the choice youre trying to make right now
then what the hell are you saying what is this all about what is the question here what are you not getting that you want 

you can date other people if you want to date other people right what are you looking to hear by posting over and over again on reddit
i understand being concerned but he told you unequivocally to back off so you back off
you keep asking about this situation but you never mention what you want or what youre comfortable with

why are you working so hard to comfort this man and get all wound up about his choices why trying to read his mind why talking to her why stay in something that is so messy and hard 

if you dont want to be his fwb just say so 

youre not his therapist its okay to not want to give the kind of emotional support hes looking for but you need to be honest about it stop beating around the bush you dont need advice you need to get your own head on straight and set some boundaries or end a connection that isnt working for you
youre not his therapist and as his exgirlfriend you are very limited in your role as friend as well 

he hasnt changed this about his own situation for a long time its not likely hell change it now its more likely that his comment was an attempt to get you to change back and to frighten you back into the role of supporting him the relationship as it was was working for him 

you cant save him from his own choices or his depression and trying to do so will so will probably just keep you locked in the dynamic 

you need to let it be a break up
absolutely if theyre getting pressure from other people to include children when they dont want to those are the people who are burdening them youre just seeking and clarity on a decision theyve already made as long as when you talk to them youre clear that your first plan is to follow the only information you have directly from them which is not to bring the children then youre golden they can either politely confirm that or they can say that no they really did mean to make an exception and id like to have you all there
in your position id ask my husband to call a couple and tell them that hell be attending and that you will be sending your very best and staying at home with the small children asked if that sounds good with them and if it does problem solved the answer to anyone after that is just we spoke to the bride and groom and we will come to a plan that works well

if a couple says they absolutely want you there and are happy to have the small children there for a little while then you kind of hooped and rejecting the invite outright would be rude 

this isnt fatherinlaws call to make and anyone who wants to show off the grandbabies can do that on their own time not hijacking someone elses wedding
what do the couple want what is their preference 

i dont think youre totally out of line but weddings are the kind of thing sort of thing you do need to suck it up for all this is sorta the point if the couple themselves would like you there as well as your husband and that the children are welcome for a short time yes you should probably put in the work to make that happen

if its your husband and his parents puttering around and making plans behind the couples back then your husband should call a couple and ask them exactly what theyd prefer and clarify the invite
youll probably get better advice from other trans women but your approach seems needlessly dangerous to me 

and im not sure why this is on your mind if youre in a relationship thats been exclusive for two years now whats up with that
he drunk texts you so no 

you might be just looking for platonic friends but a guy who mostly texts you drunk is a shady one not friend material
sounds like the two of you skipped some really important conversations and have been playing it by ear when it comes to money you need to quit that even if you make more than her the mental load of finical planning shouldnt lie entirely with you you two need to sit down and deal with the reality of what you actually have to meet all of your commitments and long term goals
your boyfriend doesnt trust you select your own friends and is passing judgment on you based on feeling someone else had about you when you were like 17

if hes going to behave like that you cannot fix it for him and you probably shouldnt date someone who refuses to believe you when you speak 

expect to be believed and trusted when you say a onesided high school crush wasnt a major event in your life  and you dont appreciate your bf trying to turn it into one now
how old are you 

i only had one true male friend in my 20s and he was also the husband of a close friend 

i think men generally take a longer time to learn how to be just friends what they actually want in a partner as opposed to a good friend and stop seeing every woman they know as a potential its not entirely their fault they get told a lot more stories about winning a woman over with persistence than they do about just really valuing a womans friendship 

i now have a few dear male friends but they really didnt appear until my mid to late 30s
he has clearly got other issues with this friend and his gfs choices that hes masking its hard to give much advice if he wont admit there is way more going on inside his head than some sort of personal rule about vacations
ah lucky you  so its not that
if we accept that the fundamental job of being an adolescentteen is to achieve autonomy from your parents pivot to peers and enhance your own emotional skills and selfregulation and that there is a kind of progress through somewhat standard developmental stages while they do that then interruption just means what it means ya got interrupted at times by calamity or neglect or accidents and thats not you being broken or even mentally ill necessarily thats how human children respond to those situations  they cannot learn certain ageappropriate lessons in that situation so you probably have some catch up to do in some areas that lots of other people progressed through at younger ages 

thatd be my take anyways just from my own experience in therapy 

id also say i think its pretty normal for your first few sessions to feel like everything is broken and youre a hopeless mess and to be exhausted and overwhelmed ive got in and out of therapy a few times in my life and i always have to brace myself for those first few weeks no matter how happy i am with the match of therapist its a slog
by no means trying to minimize your experiences or effortless glowup but did it suddenly get warmer where you live 

i dont get approached all that much but i would say 50 of what i get takes place in the first 2 really sunny weeks where we put the parkas away everyone is just cheerful and looking to connect just a theory
once more dont work yourself up into a snit because other people arent following your script

and dont come to advice sub if all you want is validation for your own interpretation of a personal experience advice is a thing you can take or leave very similar in that way to the feedback you receive when being rejected
dude find some grace 

as another soul blessed earlier than most with a secure attachment style and some selfknowledge get the hell out of your own skull and realize not everyone is fucking with you

mostly they are just figuring their own shit out andor not that into you 

find some of the chill you claim to have and let people be people messy complicated confused people youll have your days too and youll be happier if you assume confusion and disinterest and misunderstanding  not malice dont work yourself up into a snit cause other people arent following your scripts
bisexuals have a harder time dating lesbians than lesbians do this is a pretty well understood phenomenon and a lot of lesbians wont date bisexual woman at all its certainly easier to get a date with a straight man but that is a numbers game more than a reflection on men or women there are just way more single dudes looking to date and who will date a bisexual woman then there are bisexual womanlesbians looking to or open to date bisexual woman even just demographically speaking
its totally bit of mythology that ted bundy seduced his victims the first people he seduced were all the professional white dudes in psychiatry and policing and journalism who though he looked just like one of them 

bundy hunted constantly he broke into homes and killed women while they slept he pretended to be disabled and in need of help they women he killed didnt fall for him or date him or love him he fooled other men and became a celebrity target for some mentally ill women when incarcerated but he didnt seduce women he viewed them as objects to possess and was remorseless seduction was never his game with his victims his charm was reserved for the men who saw themselves in him
exactly i have a few men in my life who are criers and its lovely and connecting im so grateful for them sharing vulnerability is a beautiful thing but the last time i had a guy wail at me about respecting his tears he was trauma dumping and trying to turn the conversation about his bad feelings when i really needed to address his bad actions 

he was shocked and claimed sexism when i said i am glad you feel poorly about your behaviour i think you should im not able to comfort you right now i am legitimately very angry with you and am going to take some distance
this exactly im a bisexual woman and to be the pursuer is to be rejected 19 times out of 20 or better thats the situation even if you are thoughtful and picky about where you put your energy with straight men you get the doublewhammy of those who are just not interested and those who absolutely cannot handle assertive women and its not like they wear labels a lot of guys think they want to be pursued or propositioned or seduced until it actually happens and they either arent in the individual woman or are just deeply uncomfortable with the dynamic

in the end i just had to admit i didnt want to be with a man who couldnt handle me expressing my interest clearly anyway and roll with those punches
straight up my sewing machine takes way more technical skill and knowledge to maintain and repair than my gaming laptop
id like to see this dude even manage to thread an overlocker
sesh whose gonna tell him that the pretty cashier is also only just pretending to give a damn if he had a nice day or not and might even cash out black men and wish them a nice day those lying lawbreakers
and she gets to be annoyed with you and doubtful of you

you can keep repeating yourself if youd like but im gonna stop now
tell yourself whatever story you want about your own motivations your gf is perfectly reasonable to be both annoyed with you and skeptical of you 

you can dig your heels and get your way probably but her feelings are understandable and valid and it doesnt reflect great on you that you cannot be pleasant to her friend and colleague from work over a drink or two  holiday or no
thats not selfish that is you be a competent adult 

date another competent adult
drinks with a local friend is usually a great idea while on holiday 

unless it would take some massive investment of time or money in order to meet up with this friend it sounds like youre being petty and insecure
the real question here is are you comfortable with the friends with benefit role youve accepted with this man which includes this level of emotional labour and intimacy 

friends with benefit arrangements come in lots of shapes and styles we cannot read his mind any better than you can but this questions suggests you have concerns about what youve agreed too with him and what youve being involved in
its totally fair to be hurt it probably would be wise to ask her about it 

asking her does risk more pain but not knowing it likely worse by admitting youre hurt you give her a chance to acknowledge you even if shed have made different choices and at least youll better understand

its not a fight theres nothing to fight about she cant make it not hurt you and you cant change her mind its probably gonna suck just try to understand one another
great then you know that youre not his clinician and you know to stop rehearsing this fight with an imaginary version of him in your own head or working yourself into a snit with your own assumptions and actually express your own totally valid concerns and needs without the harsh judgments of his character and current choices thats the next step good luck
you didnt answer any of my questions leads me to think that no you havent spoken up at all so thats a lot of lecturing directed at a random persons online with a lot of conclusions already drawn about his character and mental health all seemingly without any substantial conversation with him you must see thats rather toxic behaviour on your part to have your mind so made up about him without ever asking or listening to him on the subject

check yourself put on your big girl pants be transparent about your needs and expectations but enter this important conversation with a tad more respect for differences than this youre trying to be partner youre not qualified to be his therapist and its not fair to toss these labels at him the first time youre clearly communicating your unhappy with his choices
have you been this frank with him have you spelled out your expectations around meals and how much time youre willing to spend with his family 

also why are you framing this as a dependancy instead of a choice you say his parents arent demanding of this so your fianc is making a clear choice for himself and not even necessarily an unhealthy one just one you would like to see changed
you dont have to be perfect to deserve basic respect and civility
hes much too old to be treating other people like this dont date a man who cannot spend 20 mins in pleasant conversation with family members you value and be on time for a meal when he is guest
always its been weeks thats not always that a significant amount of the time shes known him 

the forced timeline is doing them both a even bigger disservice than the others accountability cant be rushed like this bliss has totally reasonable feelings and fears that are going to keep cropping up for a while even if she is doing all the work she can to move past them forgiveness is rarely a light switch even when both people genuinely want it to be and forgiveness doesnt mean you magically feel good or the pain is erased and fully healed forgiveness is often given while were still hurting you cant punch someone in the face on tuesday apologize and tell them its in the past at lunch on wednesday while the bruise is still swelling they are going to legitimately say just because i forgive you doesnt mean there isnt still a pain
nothing about this changes my advice and it doesnt reflect the respect you say you have

youve shared your opinion that is what you get the risks are all hers the choice is hers shes made it you respect it or you gfto 

its not about you as a guy its about her interpersonal risk management
there is a fine line between him being upset that he is missing out which is reasonable and him trying to throw shade or punish you for going

the next time he makes a comment that stings say so ouch that hurts it feels like im being punished and thats not fair see if he can be accountable and own his own shit or if he doublesdown on blaming you for his own bad feelings
sure its possible

doesnt mean youre required to find it acceptable doesnt make him any less shitty doesnt mean youre in a secure and healthy relationship 

it doesnt make it better him being that stupid and shallow doesnt mean youre required to get over it

youre making and allowing a lot of excuses for him bottom line for me would be if he actually is that stupid ignorant and careless with other women while also betraying his gf then i wouldnt date him if all your excuses are true you still shouldnt date him thats too dumb to date
your boyfriend has a madonnawhore complex he is not interested in fixing inside himself

if your not his perfect wifey madonna then youre trash 

this is a very distinct issue from not caring for tattoos people can not much like tattoos without comparing women with them to porn stars or saying shame things like wives dont have tattoos

you got the ick because he treated some women as for sex and other women as for wifey and naturally many woman enjoy both and those roles are not defined by tattoos 

dont marry a man who can only see a woman worth on the basis of her body if you do you live with the constant risk of him deciding youre not wifey but trash and nothing you say or do will change his mind also youre likely not to have a very good sex life if he has decided its other kids of woman who are for sex and not you a man who categorizes women that way is not a safe partner
you should respect her comfort level and choice on how to manage this shes the one who had to absorb all risks and consequences for any steps she takes next not you and probably not even him 

so if she says its not worth it then its not worth it to her end of story

she handled it appropriately at the time and kept herself safe that is what matters most 

its bad enough he bullied her this way the whole thing just gets worse if you make it all about your feelings and opinions and try to bully her into a confrontation with him she doesnt want because your ego was bruised that someone did this to your girl

back off she says its handled then its handled
sleep is a vital part of human health and sanity

your fianc needs to moderate his expectations and think of others ways to address any needs he has for intimacy cuddle while you are watching a movie or listening to a podcast or something for a bit before bed kick off the covers and cuddle for a bit in the morning more hugs and touches though out the everyday activities maybe sleeping time is for sleep

hes the one ruining your relationship if he doesnt do that work to moderate himself and respect you 

you cant comprise your sleep itll literally destroy you and eventually your marriage

dont marry him until he addresses this behaviour hes too old not to know better
this is my thing the timeline pressure here is what is totally unreasonable in this case i mean unreasonable timelines are sorta the name of the game but still

it forces them both to rush through the accountability stage straight into the honeymoon while also sorta robbing bliss of that honeymoon mexico time i worry the pressure of the show will leave zack thinking his mistake is just in the past when its totally and very literally still present in the context of the damn show and it will be for a long time even if he and bliss are great together
im not in the us either but okay

36 hours is a range in which you need to manage yourself far better than this she may be disinterested and that is frustrating but one good date isnt a contract for ceaseless attention and communication
youre aware us a holiday weekend and many people will be with family right on top of normal adult obligations 

lots of people do ghost after first dates and it sucks but your expectations for contact are excessive its barely been 12 hours get a grip

you just met this woman her world doesnt revolve around you suggest a second date for sometime next week if thats what you want to see happen your anxiety is going to be your own worse enemy in this case and any other
this isnt a relationship question

forcing strangers and customer service reps to participate in your kink in however a small way is unethical

figure your shit out and keep private cashiers arent be paid enough for whatever nonsense youre up too
if you dont wish to be housewife dont marry this guy

he wants a housewife and he is willing to bully and manipulate in order to get it
ive had one stubborn dark hair on my chin since puberty and another joined in my mid30s 

never heard suggested its any sort of problem or concern mostly just trad barbs with my partner over it and his stray nose hairs
my grandmother sexist as hell in her own right and shamelessly favouring her boys said maybe this man every single time
my youngest sister is 13 years younger than me and let me tell you i really expected the comments to be even worse

some of the stuff i heard from people who assumed she was my child including from adult woman would make you vomit

it was upsetting to the point my mother started to avoid me being left alone in public spaces with my littlest sister
solving a problem responsibly and making healthy choices for yourself is an attractive quality in a grown up 

these are your insecurities thats okay you came by them honestly but dont force them into the mouths of the people who care for you
eh reddit skews young and youll get a lot of responses from teenagers and young 20s somethings who are still all up in their own childhood trauma and teenage resentments this is much more of an adult 3040s sort of relationship management question i think it takes a bit more distance to see something like this more clearly

however valid annes anger or boundaries are she doesnt get to require you to punish beth for her for the rest of beths life that is not a reasonable expectation of you youre entitled to attempt to form your own adult relationship with beth independent of anne and of your parents
my parents have failed both daughters in every possible way

this its this this is the problem and you cannot solve it for the rest of them your parents created all of these monsters and continue to support and feed the beasts they will not be slain by you alone

the only thing you can do is the thing you have done included beth in your own conception of your own family it might now work out but only by doing the work to create a connection there yourself just between you two will you learn what beth is actually capable of and might want in her connections with family members ignore annes bullying remain polite as you can be as you either accept or decline invitations from anne largely you should decline to speak to anne about beth or beth about anne 

you may also consider inviting your parents andor beth to your place at any time you know anne is busy with her inlaws or is away on vacation or the link that is a bit underhanded but it will minimize her fits and when she complains about the distance when you next invite her you can remind her how unhappy she seemed to be when you invited your parents while she was busy

if your niece is small try to maintain contact with her on holidays by sending a card or small gift even if youre not going to attend its good to maintain that holiday connection with a small child in this situation even as you need to balance other obligations and events
end contact

religating the break up is petty and counterproductive youre going to have to live with and learn from your own regret of not breaking up with him sooner when you should have because he was mean 

you cannot control the story he tells himself just stop listening to it by ending all contact with him
if there are laws in your country that preventing you from working without your parents consent then youd probably benefit way more from local advice most users on rrelationships are americans or from other very western societies 

what is it your mother wants you to do in the next few years if she doesnt want you to work do you age out of the law at some point are allowed to work without her permission
the fight about who talks longer is a distraction

the fight you need to have is the one where you tell him his actions do not reflect respect or that he values what you to say he is expressing frustration that he doesnt know what is up with you but he is also sending you silencing messages when you try to communicate

communication doesnt just mean you trying harder to be heard by him or adapting yourself so you can somehow get through to him it must also include him making real effort to listen and understand and yes that does take work work you are naturally putting in when he speaks work he has probably does naturally with nearly everyone else in his life that he values work he also has to put in to listening and understanding you 

youre never going to prove to him something he doesnt want to believe because it doesnt reflect the story and the role hes assigned to you challenege the story head on the story of my partner doesnt have meaingful things to say or if she just said it the way i wanted to hear it id listen 

it may be time to state clearly that the story needs to change and the behavior needs to change or the partnership will have to change in response
that is pretty extreme i always think its fun to tell them toronto is slightly bigger than chicago which both have about the same population as brooklyn and watch them recalculate i never mind people not knowing that relative size stuff but the electricity and igloos things bug me tho
i give your sealioning a solid b

transparent and a bit of a slip admitting that you werent asking in good faith to begin with but still a wellexecuted online rhetorical maneuver that will fool some readers
why on earth would i talk to you after that closing comment seriously use your head thats not how we express honest curiosity or ask for favours

read through the rest of this thread for specific examples of normalized nudity and toplessness or use google i dont service the curiosity of people who speak to me that way it doesnt suggest good faith engagement at all and im not here to address your personal life experience
youd be shocked by the number of americans who have asked me about igloos and sled dogs when tell them im canadian and no only a few of them were joking 

i can see new york state from my house on most days but they act like i live on a different planet
closure is bullshit

closure is what you find and create for yourself when you let go of what no longer serves you or what is unkowable it rarely if ever comes through conversations with others 

this isnt about andrew the person anymore this is about andrew the bad mental habit you break this habit with the same sort of strategies youd use to stop picking your nose or biting your nails use unpleasant interruptions to those thoughts and willpower

recognize this is really about ego and about the story in your head and about the fact that no person with one life to live can follow all paths not about the man

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

stop acting like its that simple and safe to stand up for yourself in every context

women are not magically born knowing how to deal perfectly with these bullies but we learn quickly there can be consequences to ourselves for telling them off in class or in the workplace like murder murder is an actual risk for a woman if she chooses to tell him off pick the wrong guy and you can be shamed at school or work suffer harassment for years or possibly even get killed

stop expecting women to roll those dice each time someone is rude to her in a way them in a way that hurts the bfs fee fees
its normal

if youre not comfortable dont go over on hot days

do not try to educate them they are not savages or ignorant youre the one here is who isnt progressive and if you are an american its a good moment to learn that what you think is leftist or progressive is the states is still pretty damn rightleaning in most of the rest of the developed world obamas policies were centreright on a global scale rarely left of centre by most other places standards american politics have been dragged so far to the extreme right that what you think is insanely progressive barely scratches the surface in most places

but this doesnt even necessarily exist on a political spectrum for them its simply normal in a lot of places 

youre the one who has been misinformed by a culture that views womens bodies are inherently sexual and prioritizes performative modesty over womens actual comfort
youre 16 youre describing dating youre describing a normal failure rate for dating you go out you mostly dont vibe the vast vast vast majority doesnt get past the talkingfirst date stage thats dating 

youre also describing a rather normal amount of selfcentredness for most teenagers

youve had maybe two years behind you where you were capable of doing anything like actually dating another human being you have like 60 ahead of you relax

youre not a narcissist if you were you wouldnt worry about this and youd easily fool people into thinking you were kind and empathetic to get your way the fact you are aware of this and concerned by it probably means youre not quite as bad as you think you are 

practice active listening and consideration with other people in your life recognize that a huge part of your overtalking is probably your nerves dont get so wound up about dates i like to think of a first date as a predate its a meeting where we both decide if we even want to have an actual date if im really nervous i even think of a few questions i can ask the other person to get them talking about their interests for a bit 

youre honestly doing just fine the worst thing you can do is get all up in your own head about your own perceived terrible flaws at the age of 16 they become selffulfilling prophecies your experiences sound well within the normal and you should have some learning to do everyone does at 16 let the rest of this bs go
this im also a nonamerican who has dated in the us

i may be compatible with a uk or canadian moderate  because in most other places moderate includes some basic social supports and some degree of abortion access  but i wont risk it with an american one american moderates arent moderate at best they just dont give a fuck
come on youre 30 give yourself a swift kick you knew it was relevant

it was emotionally relevant for both of you you kept context from him that a rational person could have assumed hed like to have you left him feeling played him for a fool so as to avoid feeling embarrassed and vulnerable yourself

its easy to say you dont owe anyone the details and thats technically true but if you want to build a serious connection with someone then trust doesnt work on technicalities anymore

you dodged a conversation that you should have as a rational adult realized may have been important to a serious partner maybe you didnt want it to me important mahybe you were worried they would put too much or the wrong kind of importance on it but clearly was important enough to you that you were motivated to avoid it and took the risk away by keeping him in the dark that wasnt considerate of his feelings it wasnt very fair to either of you

if his response hurt you by all means say so

but also recognize your choice to withhold this information however much it was technically your right to do so probably also hurt him thats valid too a reasonable person could have assumed this was information hed rather have than not have as a person who cares for you and want to build a mutually enjoyable and honest romantic and sexual relationship with you
i think all manipulatorsabusers have something they can point to and say see all i do for you which often completely divorced from your actual desires or needs 

for my ex is was picking up the cheque at restaurants regardless of whether or not i have liked to stay in to eat me paying would have been emasculating of course but as the relationship began to end i was magically transformed into the bitch who never paid and i dont have savings because of your expectations
im sorry youre going through this

i know there often isnt much to do except ride it out and not provide any feedback at all to these screams for your attention cause thats all the insults are he knows hes been cut just wants whatever validation he can squeeze out of you by compelling a reaction 

ignore and document all you can at this stage really

do you have some close friends you can talk to about it its helpful to have someone to workshop all those clever responses you can never send i think like how gross it is he wanted to fuck someone with the intellect of a small child
dont date such a lousy mental health counsellor

or at least dont be reliant on someone who is not on time for your ride to work 

communication comes in a lot of forms your bf does need to extend you some trust when you decide not to make an issue of a feeling youre experiencing 

and nonverbal cues are not bad lots of nonverbal communication is positive and helps to maintain connections between people nonverbal communication is harmful when its misinterpreted or when there is too much or too little of it 

what is definitely bad for relationships is defensiveness and blameshifting
after three years together why are you suddenly concerned that someone might harass you

age gaps have risks and struggles less so as you enter your 30s but still its been three years why is this question on your brain and coming out to a bunch of randoms online now
this is probably not a great example of the problematic dynamic you are experiencing with your mother you were joking and she joked reasonably back ya dont get to pick your baby 

you might want to talk to a therapist if you find yourself dissatisfied with your relationship with your mother or frequently seeking validation where there is none to be had and there never really has been
i would have a hard boundary on being spoken to this way as well

i also wouldnt want to stay with someone who snapped at me while i was driving or pressured me to drive more aggressively than i was comfortable with that would also be a super firm boundary for me like i might have pulled the car over if you had done that to me i do not like that i would not tolerate that in a relationship sometimes we run late in life we handle our anxiety about being late better than that you did need to be told to stop that 

he didnt express his frustration well  but neither did you  and he had damn good reason to be frustrated with you by the end of this and then you jerked him around at the end again with the ill walkno i need you

next youd be wise to book an uber

your own boundary was completely valid your own behaviour was not
she is not holding a gun to your head shes crying

let her cry let her pout let everyone else treat her like the damn fool she is and ignore anyone who doesnt have that much sense

shes not forcing you youve just decided you rather be her prisoner and give up what you want on your day than see her sad

pick another dayevent to wear her dress and tell her if she cannot truly behave herself at your damn wedding she can sit at home and you wont wear it at all
it is baffling to me how many of them can simultaneously argue men are violent brainless sex monsters and also inherently more logical and designed for leadership
tell me you think that 26 salad buys you sex without telling me you think that 26 salad buys you sex
you can stop this youre just not

youre clinging to the story of a relationship that didnt even work out when you were 17 years old it when life is the simplest

its easy to romanticize the past and to keep revisiting it in your mind whenever life gets scarry or sad its harder to face the reality of a future that doesnt include the dreams you dreamt at 15
tell him if he really wants to work on this to take his commitmentphobic ass to therapy and do that damn work himself

if he doesnt do at least that you should look into what it will cost to breaktransfer this lease

there is nothing you can do to fix this for him its not about how pretty you look or how nice your nails are frankly its probably a lot about him avoiding the work of being in a relationship and pushing all the work onto you by creating emotional threats in the relationship that you feel you must respond too 

if he doesnt want to break up he needs to go do the work to fix this for himself and for the relationship if he wont be rid of him
this is going to hurt his feelings if the positions were reversed it would hurts yours this just a hurtful reality its no ones fault but it is painful 

its not overstepping to express to him that there are things youd really like to do together walking going to shows that his weight is making more difficult its not overstepping to tell him youd really be happy if he would participate in the weight loss with you 

focus on the activities you want to share dont mention appearance dont mention other people he probably will because that is where the shame hits hardest stay focused on the quality of the time you two can share together
this is grief its okay grieving is exactly what is happening right now

block andy everywhere

the only thing you need to consider in the near future is how youre going to address your parents part in this because this issue actually wasnt ever between you and andy it was between you and your parents and andy and your parents but your parents foisted it onto you they should never had said to talk to you about the value of the honda they should have said the honda was giving to her outright so its not ours anymore she doesnt owe you half of it and that is exactly what you should have said as well when andy asked they gave it us outright its not theirs anymore so its not half yours if you feel mom and dad owe you something or have agreed to help you get a car talk to them

your parents chickened out and left you holding the bag for their choices with their unstable son and you all failed to be totally clear with him because you were fearful of him responding irrationally you can see where that got you all in the end 

show them what was postedtexted to you explain you are currently going no contact with andy and that is nonnegotiable let them do with that information what they will hopefully they will recognize they made mistakes that contributed to andys confusion and angry irrational as it may be dont expect them to stay nocontact with him for long they probably give right in to whatever his demands are you stay out of it
thats unfortuante but again i have been abundantly clear with you

unless my partner told me very clearly that the package needed to be signed for or handed to an actual person for the delivery to be competedly which is functionally the same thing here i would not open that door i would assume the package would be left and we could grab it in a minute 

youve asked a question you clearly dont like my answer and thats fine you probably should try to form the question about your relationship which is the actual issue here

im done repeating myself good luck with it
yes i would not open the door for a package that was going to be set down and left i would wait a few minutes and then stand up and get it i would not open my door to a stranger not even one i may reasonably assume was a delivery person i would not let an unexpected knocking person even know i was home if i could help it 

whats the actual issue here cause its clearly not the package
dude i was super clear unless my partner had very specifically said it need to be signed for if it was just a package id assume it would be set down and wed grab it in a min without me opening the door for unknown person

you got relationship issues communication issues consideration and respect issues ask about those actual issues you asked about opening the door and i answered with plenty of particulars and caveats there is a logic to not answering the door that might or might not apply here
i wouldnt have answered the door in that situation unless my partner had very very specifically told me a package needed to be signed for otherwise id expect theyd set it down and wed grab it in a few mins 

doesnt matter what uniform they are wearing unless i know youre coming and why i dont open the door for you this means i also dont stand up and look through the peep hold alerting you to the fact im home period its not an unreasonable boundary for a person to have in life depending on where they live or have lived in the past most women i know operate in some sort of similar way 

she may have been inconsiderate in this particular situation but in general her behaviour is within the range of normal
there isnt much to do it feels insufficient because you cannot actually control her all you can do is starve her of all attention and dram to the best of your ability

you block her everywhere neither of you ever respond again you keep records of her behaviour in case you need to get the police involved

you can both also consider warning your workplace or boss that you have an ex harassing you personally i think its good to get out in front of this in the workplace and ask people to be cautious giving out your information or location 

you need to trust your friends and network to not support this harassment talk to one or two of your closest friends about the harassment and dont skimp on the word harassment and let them know you are asking all your friends to keep information about your relationship and your wedding private so as not to expose you to further abuse

anyone who doesnt completely agree with that should be uninvited but you dont have to deal with that right away right now you just have to lay down the law absolutely zero reply or contact with your ex from you and your fiance records for the police requests to friends to not share any information that could empower the abuser
you cannot communicate yourself out of someone elses choice

you cry yourself to sleep on the regular because he chooses to behave in ways that are at least inconsiderate if not downright cruel

nothing you do is gonna magically change him youve been clear hes been consistent this tactic works for him hes sticking to it

date the man he has shown you very clearly he intends to continue to be or dont date him at all
tell him the truth you dont want to date him

you dont think youre compataible you have very different approaches to dating and building romantic connections

dating is always a risk if you dont think this guy is a risk worth taking for you personally be honest and upfront about that it might seem mean but really its the kindest thing you can do is be clear and honest

even if you do decide to date your favourite restaurant on your birthday is a lot of pressure to put on yourself go get a damn coffee on a tuesday and keep expectations and pacing managed
keep your distance

if they ask give them a clear no thank you dont make excuses dont be overly grateful or flattered dont compliment them or try to build them back up dont explain why dont say you dont date coworkers unless you are serious about never dating a coworker ever dont try to protect their feelings too much because that will only make you unclear and leave them with confusion or false hope  

be clear to be kind

if they pull vague shit on you like maybe we could be clear that sounds like a bit like a date and i dont want to go on a date

it feels rude it feels mean only because women are trained to be terrified of rejecting men and to never bruise their egos buts not rude or mean its the kindest thing you can do to cut through the awkwardness as quickly as possible
i wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who spoke to me like that

i also wouldnt want to stay in a relationship with someone who was always planning for the worstcase scenario was chronically overthinking or made me feel unsafe 

neither of you comes off smelling like roses here both of you probably have work to do you need to figure out if its work youre gonna do together or not
reality check fathers who ask for custody is court get it almost always they basically have to be drugaddicted and homeless before the court will take away all access and even then some sort of visitation would be likely

custody is unbalanced because men dont seek it  because so many couples default to the idea that the woman has primary or sole custody  and so many men are unwilling to make the adjustments to their lives to have actual physical custody on a regular basis

by your description your husband will have little trouble getting shared custody it will just take time to work through the system

in the meantime you need to regulate your emotions a bit better get some support and spend some time with your family or friends get some space from this ongoing crisis its slowmoving by design and that sucks but thats the reality find some peace on the path

stick with the cbt hes not gone for ever that is a nightmare youre cooking up in your head that is exactly the kind of irrational thinking your cbt should be helping you to manage
masturbation is healthy communication about sex is healthy 

there is no issue here

if youre uncomfortable hearing about it ask him to keep this subject private that is all 

feel however you feel but recognize he is doing nothing wrong and this has nothing to do with you you could be having vaginal intercourse every day of the week and he still might masturbate sometimes its perfectly healthy
i think she is rather strong and secure she is totally right the closure is largely myth and that kwame keeping circling back to micah is completely bullshit 

the trouble with chelsea is that she is putting all her energy into someone who doesnt want what she wants right now thats gonna make anyone look needy and demanding she thinks if they work hard enough they can make it work its not the worst approach but its also not true

not a red flag just a bad choice
nothing about this seems at all unusual

noncreepy men exist

there is nothing to process they had a friendly lunch
it sounds like youre just not compatible and its time to end this connection

youll meet lots of people you vibe with and can have fun dates with but who just dont fit as serious partners 

dont get angry about it just accept it and let go of what doesnt work
it seems unlikely that your parents are truly worse than your boyfriend 

they at least realized you need a job if you ever have a hope of escaping this predator 

call a domestic abuse hotline and ask for help youre in danger you may not want to go home but you cannot stay where you are
i feel like this is saying a lot more about the comparative funding of public transit
ugh that does make it way harder

id still stick with the friendly lies my friend had similar hair to yours and she went crazy for this stuff dads gonna grab some for you to try make sure you really work it in there with your nails and tell me how it goes

but ya really gotta keep your goals small offer everything is an offer you have to not get invested in whether or not she takes you up on them discipline and hygiene are the parents job regardless of whether or not your dad feels comfortable with it big sisters just offer with open hands
fair point op grace is old enough to visit you without the rest of the family can you make that work
go slow pick your battles based on how receptive your think shell be id start here

i think i can help you get your hair looking cleaner would you like that

leave your dad out of it as much as you can dont let your sister know youve been talking about her behind her back if she says yes you pick the products and you sit her back over a sink like they do at the salon

if you can get over that hurtle then you tell a little lie ya know when i was a teen and my body changed i had a hard time with body odour too can i tell ya how i learned to deal with it

sadly none of this should be done unless she says yes if this becomes a discipline issue it will just have to be your dads job your role is only as an advisor and advise requires her being consenting and open youre not the boss of her youre a person with just a bit more information than her who may have some good ideas to offer 

youre a good sister go slow really really slow small steps tackle the easiest stuff first leave things like nails and skin care to end  if every  since those will feel the most like youre trying to change who she is focus on growing up healthy not appearance
play stupid games win stupid prizes

if you pull that stunt expect it to be the beginning of the end youll be in race to be the bottom to see who can be less interested 

look its been 14 dates if you want something other than what you have with this man ask for it talk about timelines and expectations openly right now you both sound be assuming the other person is also dating other people

if you want something other than that its time to say so
if she doesnt say that then she isnt singlaing she wants more frequent contact if she does say that she might simply want more time with her friends after her breakup  many people do

like i said sooner rather than later youre gonna have to take the risk and communicate clearly and it may not go well for you thats life
what do you need i have a few hours on x day no pressure but is there anything i can do for you or would you like to just hang out for a bit im just thinking of you today and sending comforting vibes no worries if you dont respond i know youre busy im just offering anything i can 

it is repetitive memes can be good for breaking up messages of supportaffection 

reiterate that you dont need a response dont get bent outta shape if you dont get one let them off the hook explicitly
if she suggests concretely doing something in the near future would be the most clear sign not a vague we should do this again but a concrete i want to do x with you lets pick a time

no perfect clues obviously at some point youll have to risk rejection but that would be clearest sign she isnt just looking to catch up and then talk again in a few months
okayyou dont like her choices youre just not compatible 

listing your grievances real or imagined isnt going to change my advice
youre not compatible

and your insecurities may make you toxic as all hell if you dont get a grip on them there is a very real risk with this attitude that no one will ever be pure enough for you you seem to be looking for reasons to think less of them and to minimize the connection you have if you have a pattern of losing respect and affection for women because they are relatively normal human beings with full lives and dont commit to you with their hearts before they commit to you with their actual words then you need to reexamine yourself

but that doesnt make you and her compatible youre simply not so stop now
you do nothing more than text occasionally like an actual friend for two weeks

this is in a conversation you will best judge in person see how the catch up goes dont develop an agenda beyond being her friend and being willing to be transparent about your feelings of she appears open that conversation

dont try to jump the queue women are not vending machines we dont just take the next guy in line the moment were single
thats kinda my point

if youre communicating that unclearly in the heat of frustration even while taking the time to type and post to a bunch of random people online who can barely follow your story and understand the real issues in the hopes of giving you advice one might suspect you are also not communicating very clearly with your wife when the feelings are really intense and you actually give a damn about what she thinks

this isnt rventing this is for advice for advice to work we have to be able to understand one another

couples counselling i dont know if this marriage can or should survive but i know if this is how you communicate under stress nothing is gonna get better
youre trickling out information very randomly you said i skipped a chore due to lack of sex but then you totally didnt cause its her chore 90 of the time

these two things arent really related they arent the problem here

if your communication with your wife is half as bad as it is here and you have any hope of continuing this marriage go see a couples counsellor and get some tips and tactics cause shesh  whatever her struggles maybe   youre not painting a picture of yourself as someone who is easy to understand and place confidence in
your replies here are very strange

this might boil down to dont be in a marriage you dont want to be in
if you were actually trying to punish her  if you skipped getting medications she thought you would get without telling her  then you were engaging in abuse outright deliberate act of abuse of your partner 

if you genuinely forgot that is something different

the lack of sex should have nothing nothing at all to with you communicating clearly whether or not you were able to pick up necessary medications on time  these are not related issues
you need mental health support this is above the pay grade for rando advice online

we cannot tell you if youre relationship is abusive based on what youve shared here you may have reasons for concern but you havent expressed those reasons here

what i can tell you is that the story youre telling right now about this event doesnt line up with the reaction and fears youre expressing the two things arent in sync that doesnt mean your reaction isnt normal but it does mean you havent been able to line up your feelings and your words with your reality describing it as cuddling but then checking carefully for bruising just doesnt make rational sense one of those two things is not reflecting reality

take those questions to a pro
was there a reason you set this boundary in the first place has he tried to choke you previously are there are other behaviors he engages in that you think might be abusive as well do you have some past trauma that can help you understand why you reacted the way you did

attempts at choking are absolutely abusive and are the kind of abuse that is likely to escalate

it doesnt appear here that either of you believed there was any intent to choke you it seems that you both understand that a boundary was violated accidentally or do you think someone else happened here besides that

i think youd benefit from getting some mental health support your reaction doesnt quite make sense in the context youve provided here you could use some more support and a place to talk through the full details of what happened and what you thought about it
stick to your no it is sad but your answer was the right one editing services are professional services professionals are trained and they get paid your father is asking your dedicated many hours to someone hes treating as a hobby if he is not willing to pay for those professional services 

and its not your hobby

if it was a profession hed be at least trying to engage and step up to paying a professional editor and it sounds like hes not pleasant for an editor to work with is he 

youre 22 your focus should be on your own path forward not on the potential family income from the book sales tell him you just cant commit the kind of time hes looking for and dont have the skills he needs to elevate his work let him pout it out

rachel renee russell makes very literally millions of dollars a year her daughter minored majored and education and minored in fine arts at the university of michigan she is being compensated for professional services shes not supporting her mothers hobby for shits and giggles and thank yous
yes shes an adult you must tell her 

if shes concerned there has been an error that might be additionally stressful for her tell her what you did so she can plan appropriately

hey i didnt want this to confuse or worry you but i wanted to give you this gift at this difficult time and i added 1000 to your account with your case worker
they know they know why they are unsafe he at least doesnt care being a safe respectful place for you is not something he values explaining will not make him care it will only make you more vulnerable to his bad behaviour dont do that definitely dont do it yet

just tell your mother the hard facts of what is going to happen next you will not be in his company again from here on out you will not speak to him or see him you do not want an apology you want zero contact with him you are cutting him out of your life entirely she is welcome in your life only if she respects that he is not be clear if that includes not talking about him his opinions or any of her issues with him if this means only seeingvisiting her outside of their shared home say so be brutally clear

this should really not be neogiatable hes out neither he nor she is to ask about him being let back in if you ever feel ready to tolerate his presence again in any way you can initiate that conversation if they try to pressure you hang up leave walk away its not a conversation you will consent to be a part of

if your mother cannot respect those terms go extremely low contact until she realizes its that or nothing

you are not a bad person this is clearly a situation where you have to put your own oxygen mask on first you cannot help your mother right now with her relationship
no one is only awful to their female partners 

a person who can betray in that context will betray in others

generally speaking if there is a risk of physical unsafety i think you have a responsibility to either tell the other person or to end all contact with the person who is harming them 

i wouldnt stand by and watch my friend punch his gf i wont stand by and watch him betray her sexually either if you really cannot tell her then the least you can do is draw firm boundaries and let him know he can no longer confide in you how he harming her
well then tell jake that you know my bf ryan lives there and well probably see him in the evenings a few times

assuming you actually want to go with jake
just say no i mean it doesnt sound like you want too anyways  there has been a misunderstanding and it might not be malicious you travel frequently to x to see your boyfriend if you go youll be spending a fair bit of time with your bf if jake is welcome then say that but be clear your bf lives there and would be a priority for any visit you made

its that simple dont try to read jakes mind or defend any feelings youre assuming he has just tell him plainly what the deal is

its always valid for people to invite who they wanna invite and lots of people dont like hanging out with couples but its obviously silly to go to where your bf lives and expect to not include him in at least most activities
it sounds like youre making a bigger deal of this than you need too

it your partner feels they are missing something of great value in your shared sex life its on them to bring that up openly and respectfully stop twisting yourself into knots to provide something hes not even asking for 

you dont find pleasure in it makes sense you dont have a prostate 

if you dont want to do it dont stop assuming its a such a big deal for him when hes not even expressing that
your emotions are interfering and that is a thing you can talk about but it does mean the way youre currently engaging in the friendship isnt working for you youre gonna have to think about what you need to do differently to allow this to be just a friendship and to kill the inappropriate expectations you have of him as just a friend

that probably means contact needs to be reduced for a while and you need to quit the social media stalking behaviors that are upsetting you
hes not your bf youre not in the kind of relationship where its appropriate to ask him to moderate his behavior like that 

think about the boundaries you need to have for yourself do you need to stop following him in ig for a while do you need to admit youre not actually friends because your feelings run too deep for that 

you can end a friendship if it leaves you feeling conflicted and unhappy
doing this without her consent is disgusting no pass on that youre not a child that is knowable that was not okay what if a coworker or friend saw it thought she was cheating on her husband or that you had an open marriage give your head a shake youre not this stupid 

but no the fact that realizing her attractiveness to other people made you more attractive to you is rather shallow but perfectly human basically the entire physiological core behind kinks like hotwifing and cuckolding

what you need to learn how to do is find your eurake moments without acting like a little shit first
i think you need to accept he doesnt want to understand it

the problem isnt with your communication there isnt some perfect way you can phrase this to make him get the message his current comfort is dependent on him not getting the message if he got the message he wouldnt get what he wants so he wont 

he is not confused respect me as an equal and a partner when it comes to money matters and household chore division is not that hard or complicated hes choosing not to listen to you when you say things he doesnt like
100 this is totally me man have reason you lady have feelings me right you wrong 

i hope op can move pass the gaslighting and misplaced empathy to the boundaries and gtfo stage of this
how the hell did you end up living with someone who refuses to communicate with you about money or about division of labour that stonewalling shit is absolutely misogynistic thats not a feels 

thats a reality of a man who thinks the big calls are his to make and yours to live with
you cant make it right

you made a choice that choice had consequences

you can and should apologize and admit wrong going without any excuse then leave him alone hes made his call his call was clear and reasonable

sometimes you just dont get to make it right the wrong stands all you can is be better next time
pets dont come into a home without all the adults in that household being fully onboard 

there is no such thing as a pet that has zero impact on the other person 

if youre not comfortable being the back up caregiver for a snake no snake full stop
i mean its a views and followers economy and apologies are good content why wouldnt they post apologies
oh hes just a chicken shit a gameplaying chicken shit

telling you would have felt awkward and vulnerable so he didnt talking about your past sex life was way more fun 

and thats the best case scenario you know exactly what the worst case is 

reconsider being his friend he wasnt prepared to treat you like one
really cause it seems like hes the one still at the teat here
im sorry but that was extremely conveniently naive of you 

hes fine with his mothers behaviour because it means he doesnt have to be accountable to her or to you financially hes comfortable with the trade off of her behaviour for her cash 

thats not gonna change either live with it or escape it
yeah bf sounds like a little shit who is happy to let mommy and gf fight it out passive aggressively because neither of them are willing to point at him and say you youre being a shit
if parenting is important to you consider now what your options are for doing it alone you may not have any but the women i know who started thinking that way at 30 basically designed their lives around it were well equipped for single motherhood before 40 and are blissfully happy so if parenthood is a goal consider what that goals looks like without a partner 

as for the dating dont sweat it dating it hard in someways its harder when youre older but thats only because you have less time for bullshit and a richer fuller life there are plenty of men who will want you in your 30s plus a good chunk of 22 year old guys too seriously that part is a bit weird
your husband is getting rightly railed for basically wanting you to be lesser than again and to centre himself in the marriage however here are a few slightly valid points that might be buried beneath his ego

the home space become a work space is disruptive and blurs the line between working time and together time you are subsidizing your work with your shared home thats a real thing that is happening and has to be acknowledged openly 

it is more volatile you could start loosing money and quickly and have to be difficult to admit it to yourself its very easy for a personal business to turn into a loosing bet you cannot let go of 

however both of these issues can and should be addressed through open communication and balance not by putting his foot down like a stubborn toddler as if hes actually has control like that 

id recommend marriage counselling the answer right now from you should be along the lines of i hear youre seriously unhappy but i will not be ordered around like a child this conversation will be ongoing and for now i will continue as i am because its providing well for us all and its the best use i see for my time come to counselling with me and we can discuss what the future looks like in a respectful way
honestly not much imo i dont know many people who had kids in their 20s on purpose excepting those who choose lifetime secure careers with powerful unions and good pensions its almost like economic security really helps 

the risks exists for both men and women but for people in their 30s they remain pretty negligible its all just the same shit weve been doing for decades shaming women for making choices that make them feel secure and empowered treating parenting as part hobby part biological obligation or even a punishment instead of a serious and very important bit of work that people who want to sign up for should be empowered and supported
its okay to be hurt and disappointed but confrontation doesnt seem helpful to anyone here least of all yourself

plan a visit to see to them and bring a premade meal or some such choreeasing gift some moms are up and active two months in many are still healing and not on anything like a schedule yet
every single bit of this is a bf problem not a mother problem

 your 32yearold boyfriend has not prioritized or apparently shared his plan with you for paying down his education debt
 your bf has watched as your savings dwindled throughout this relationship without comment or concern it seeems
 your bf has not spoken with you to create a realistic and responsible plan for the future
 your bf accepted money first towards his downpayment then told his mom she couldnt live there

the mother isnt a problem really shes not she might not like you much she may be toxic or abusive in other ways but that isnt the issue here on the loan the issue is your bf is not transparent with you about money and doesnt have an acceptable plan he can articulate to you about his debt

i doubt he really plans to pay it all back to be honest id bet hes just accepted this holding pattern of lowkey abuse until she dies or becomes incapacitated
nah marshall needs to be the fixer and chelsea needs to be the decider but chelsea doesnt really need to be fixed and marshall communicates his own choices for himself so clearly and rationally that hed frustrate her

if they both got their own shit a bit better under control maybe but right this moment no they dont offer the other enough fuel
100 brunette was clearly queen bee and knew it and was running circles round both shelby and micah

micah is a gretchen wieners in constant search of her regina george literally the nicest thing i can say about her
both of her friends were clearly jealous if not of the engagement then of the reality tv gig at least

the thing they have is just standard toxic enmeshment shelby is getting the headlines for her drunken mess but i really felt she was just the meat shield  micayla was the queen bee and she knew exactly what she was up to spinning shit up and giving all those compliments to micah that were not really compliments and all had  at the end of them micayla knew how to bring the drama but keep her hands clean anyone with two brain cells to rub together could crush shelby which is why even paul managed that micayla is the dangerous one 

it almost made me sorry for micah because those dynamics can be hard to escape if you think that is what friendship is supposed to feel like almost until she immediately joined the pack and turned on paul like a hyena
i have never had difficulty enforcing expectations and boundaries on my friends and my partner without suggesting they are competing with one another for my time or attention

creating balance and boundaries doesnt require competition and conflict thats not naive thats just declining to live your life doing battle with needy children in grownup bodies getting rid of partners or friends who have that framing has only gotten easier and easier
no suggest she speak to a doctor now about her intention to try to get pregnant in the next year or two its a bit early for a preconception checkup but there is no reason not to ask for one if you dont have a family doctor its time for her to try seriously to find one let them tell her if her weight is a significant issue because you dont actually know  bmi is not a medically relevant scale and google isnt med school 75 of pregnant women are overweight its not the bestcase scenario but treating it like a crime isnt accurate either 

dont pretend to be an authority ask her to speak to an actual authority on what steps can be taken now or in the coming year to be in the best position possible when youre ready  


stop googling about womens health before you fall down a real rabbit hole of truly inane bullshit

  
the next step in her taking this seriously is speaking to someone who is serious and informed  


youre not out of bounds to want the best odds but youre way out of your area of expertise and that is not where you start you start by encouraging her to get support so she knows her timelines has some goals and is building relationships with her possible care team
the median number of past sexual partners for an american woman age 2549 is 43

and nearly 25 of people age 2529 are virgins youre a minority sure but youre not a myth and ya clearly have some baggage and bias associated with your perceptive status 

if youre only meeting women with a history of gangbangs something youre doing is the problem not women in general

first step watch less porn thats not women thats a reflection of your personal choices not lining up with what you claim to want in a partnership

second step seek therapy for your warped perspective on your own sexuality and the sexuality of others
yeah even more than mental health support i think where lib fails these people is by not providing them with a financial plannerpremarital counselling on legal money matters like just an hour and list of questions sesh
i agree from what we saw i thought tiffany did a totally mature sort of um but youre not racking up debt for this cool shit right vibe check and she and brett had some mostly healthy and mutual sounding joshing about being bougie 

i suspect some of that was also tiffany checking in on her own insecurities about not bringing the same funds into the marriage that brett clearly had if i were tiffany thatd be a concern for me too 

hopefully they had a more serious conversation about money offcamera but if i was dating a guy who dressed like brett did i would 100 want to make sure this was a luxury spend he had under control before i took steps forward with him when i moved in with my current bf he had a very expensive hobby and i absolutely asked him pointed questions about how he balanced that with other spending priorities and that was just moving in and splitting things 5050 not marriage
yeah i didnt really catch the judgment in him either at that moment it was more like chealse was overquick to defend herself when it really wasnt that pink it was a single ladys apartment big shrug 

there are lots of shitty conversations between these two but that one was rather sweet
my bf likes pink more than i do our compromise was deep raspberry pink accent i had to draw a really hard line against hot pink baby pink and pastel
if you truly cannot control yourself go talk to a good therapist who can give you a swift verbal kick the next time you get weak and help you approach new relationships without all the anxiety and trauma this shitty one has left you with

no one else can solve this problem for you youre gonna waste the rest of your 20s on this mans bullshit and have nothing to show for it if you dont wise up im sorry to be so harsh but it really is that simple 

stop performing that same drama with this guy that you two started with when you were like 17 its not getting better its not likely to get better better exists for you someplace else with someone else
youre not friends any longer you dont bring anything positive into one another lives

youre not getting back together you really shouldnt not even after therapy 

the best help you can give both of you is accepting that six years of on and off plus this toxicity and his untreated mental health issues is to finally call it end it for good grow with someone else someone who doesnt need you to play a perfectly calm therapist in order for them to meet the bare minimum standards of communication and be able to cope 

go be less insecure with someone who actually offers you security and someone who can handle the fact that anger happens sometimes in a longterm relationship
break up with him

you cannot stop him he feels entitled to use the images and bodies of women he knows as his own personal porn stars he doesnt care that they are not consenting or that isnt why those images exist or that would reasonably be upset by this behavior or that you are upset by this behaviour he thinks he has the right to do this he thinks he has the right to tell declare that his ex his coworker his buddys sister is a porn star now because he wants her to be

dont sit around waiting to catch him break up with him because he doesnt value consent and that is dangerous and unworthy of trust

fantasizing inside your own brain is entirely different than choosing to curate photos of people you know and wank to them reprosing photos is an action not a just a private thought only shitty little boys who dont care about consent or respect women like to pretend it isnt because the violation of women they know is pat of what they are enjoying if it wasnt theyd happily use all that free porn no problem 

the violation is the point the lack of consent is the point get rid of him
nah that would result in only contestants who had some fundamental relationship skills and were capable of transparency and honesty with those closest to them 

then there wouldnt be a show
seems like his mom just wouldnt sign a waiver
it was just awful i had to fast forward a bit because paul was working so hard to ignore how awful they were without insulting them directly i suspect this is not his first encounter with mean girls but how he didnt realize micah was one i dont know 

queen bee brunette was clearly deeply jealous and tossing shade in each of those compliments to micah  knowing that sloshed blondey would do the dirty work for her  and lord did she i was just shocked that micah immediately defended her friends totally vague something or other complaint about him he was too articulate not self depreciating enough for her tastes i dunno my 3 year old niece better communicates her upsets than that woman did

the nicest thing i can say about kwame right now is that even he doesnt deserve micah
your bf used his sister to take the heat for him when his friends sexualized one of their little sisters

look your bf isnt treating any woman that well if he only treats them well in private and not when they are being exposed to abuse and ridicule 

withdraw your ultimatum dont let your bf think its your job or his sisters job to fight his fights for him dont let him make that the womans job too hes quickly becoming the kind of guy who blames the women for making him not be a creep so he doesnt loose too much face with the asshole men expect him to demand his friends treat others with respect if he really cannot hack that dump him

dont ride this out for long he will use you and your anger as a shield from real consequences for he behaviour he is part of and is condoning and he will let them mock your rage to keep his friendship if hell do it to his own sister hell do it you
all you can do is give good advice

ideally kind and compassionate advice 

objectively the age difference alone and the newness of the relationship are plenty enough to caution against a legal contract but its not clear from your question that either of them are actually rushing into it 

stop calling her a divorcee and a single mother as if these are insults it makes you sound like youre in your 80s screaming at kids to get off your lawn you will quite rightly loose credibility if you dont accept that single parents and divorcees are not damaged goods shes not in a situation shes living a normal perfectly valid and successful life by all reports here 

and her career is the couples business not yours 

if this is a mistake its your sons to make ask him questions be concerned for his happiness give him advice final decisions belong to him   insulting her personally isnt going to change that its okay going to make you appear judgmental and unreliable
you dont need to understand 

youre 40 be the adult here and cut him out hes clearly a toxic child who brings nothing of value to your life how is this even a question 

he played out his milf fantasy and made some money while he did it hopefully you enjoyed youre bizarre barely legal fun times too now he gets to play with you like a toy whenever hes bored no get rid of him block him everywhere seehs
youre not crazy and the hard truth is youre going to need to leave to change this dynamic

women arent a monolith we dont share a hive mind were basically sane individuals like men

if youre looking to start a family you should absolutely move to a lower cost of living area most women who want children will very very rationally balk at 33k in greater london if parenting is a goal you should probably make some changes to make that more feasible and as quickly as you can 

thats not about providing a lifestyle thats about being a compatible partner your heart isnt gonna pay for summer camp or piano lessons very few women will feel secure having a family with you because women are basically rational 

if youre looking simply date your financial health and living within your means is probably more important when it comes to compatibility youre not compatible with women who want a provider so dont pretend you are 

dating is hard everyone is screwed youre less of an outlier than you realize its just that hard
if he wont acknowledge that he owes it to you and to this marriage to work on the issue that exists solely inside of his head and results in completely inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour towards you then there is nothing you can to do fix this 

he can moderate both his feelings and his responses he does so successfully in many areas of his life he needs to recognize this one area where the skill is lacking and must be developed 

there is no resolution without that accountability and realization you cannot support him out of this until he is dedicated to walking the path out of it 

if youre never going to get angry with him for this behaviour and never admit its damaging or endangering then the relationship then its less likely hell ever be motivated to do that work the status quo works for him if you simply walk on eggs shells until hes triggered absorb this behaviour each time and accept apologies without any real commitment to change if you do that it becomes your operating agreement its the relationship youre both choosing
bf i need to be allowed to be angry with you sometimes i am angry with you and disappointed in your contributions this isnt surprising or unfair i understand this hurts your feelings im glad it hurts your feelings because that means you give a damn and i need you to give enough of a damn to change it

adhd creates struggles not assholes 

it can require some grace but not a free pass on  off all the basics certainly not a free pass on saying shitty things like we need to do better when they do not contribute is an existing issue 

your bf needs to recognize he needs to be a full participant in problem solving that doesnt mean he needs to be perfect but that means recognizing your frustrations are valid and worthy of a thoughtful response not a temper tantrum
its okay if its not worth the risk to you right now 

if youre consistently finding the conversation is getting to the we should probably meet phase and you just dont want too for whatever reason then take a damn break from the apps

dating is risky  mostly emotionally this fear of multiple peoples crazy exes seems a bit catastrophizing to me but if that is where youre at stop fighting it while chatting with individuals examine those anxieties on your own for a bit and rethink your goalsboundaries 

i keep myself safe by picking the place a friend knows where i am and basic info of who im meeting and if i am even the least bit uncomfortable taking a very roundabout way home

but most importantly i dont date when im not excited to date if it seems not worth the trouble or stress i pause the apps and go touch grass for a few months
