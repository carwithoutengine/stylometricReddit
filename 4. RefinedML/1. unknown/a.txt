nta just reply back hey dude i didnt drink more than a fifth of a bottle so im pretty sure my share is covered by the groceries i brought for everyone if you want i can send over an extra 10 but i dont want to start a habit of paying for what i didnt use
presumably this is student housing where this sort of switching of apartments is common and accepted by the landlord while not how most adult apartment complexes are run its pretty common practice in college towns
make a choice you made vows do they actually mean something to you or is it just words you said the grass is greener where you water it if you actually believe marriage means something you go nc and start focusing on your wife and your marriage communication compromise and couples therapy if you can afford it thats the only acceptable answer
he makes you a worse version of yourself why would you stagnate yourself for three years only to stay in a relationship with someone who brings out the worst in you

no work on yourself heal move on if you two are right for each other youll run into one another in the future but do not plan for it tell him youre not going to wait for him as its clear you two arent right for each other as you are
why are you throwing and paying for a baby shower for your friend and giving her no hard budget to follow unless im sorely mistaken on how baby showers work thats not normal
this goes in the face of what a lot of people say but this is also one of those rare times when you really shouldnt communicate to death about this if you need to have one more convo where you two both agree you were both asking for trouble and you will both try to move forward then sure but at the end of the day you asked the question if you cant handle the answer thats a you problem not a him problem and beating this conversation to death is only going to serve to kill your relationship even more stop talking about it after the next conversation either the pain will subside in which case awesome learn your lesson or it wont in which case that sucks but youve learned your lesson on how asking stupid questions can ruin a good thing and then both of you should go your separate ways
im all for employees not immediately being fired for the smallest of mistakes but i also wish we as a society could move away from the idea that you should be paid for not doing any work and i mean this for the common office worker and the ridiculously overpaid executive that just golfs all day earn your money it isnt that hard
you keep saying i understand if its because of my tardiness and then proceed to not understand that shes cutting you because of the tardiness and because you are stressing her out and trying to make things about yourself and your feelings rather than trying to make things easier for her which is what being a bridesmaid is actually about 

accept the fact that you messed up and arent in a position to adequately fulfill the role of a bridesmaid and gracefully apologize to her im sorry that i made your wedding about me that was wrong i get why you would be less stressed without worrying about me in the bridal party im still excited to see you get married and i hope you can forgive me because i dont want my bullheadedness to ruin our friendship

because if you dont accept your mistakes and you decide not to go youll lose this friendship and it will be because youre unable to put your friends feelings on her wedding day before your own yta a large one if i were your friend id be glad if you didnt go so i could quietly bow out of a friendship with such a selfish person
not only that but im pretty sure op is the mean girl the bride said please just accept my decision and lets move on i know thats hard for you to do which says pretty much everything about who op is as a friend 

and thats before you factor in that the bride correctly calls out op for only caring about herself and not the brides stress and claims that the bride brought up being late as a reason even though it was actually op that straight up asked if it was because of being late to the bridal shower when in reality it was three times during one weekend one time 2 hours late one time 4 hours late and who knows how late she was to the third event she even needed a plan to get her to show up early to the wedding with someone which means its not just feeling off but a general lack of respect for anyone other than herself she also kept saying shed understand if its because of how late she was but then also proceeds to text paragraphs about how hurt she is make half a dozen reddit posts with varying levels of information included to obfuscate her wrongdoings and even flat out denies being late in one of the posts as saying the bride is making it up 

op you need to do some deep reflection here because youre misrepresenting things heavily and someone who cant take accountability and blames others isnt a good friend or frankly a good person you said you would understand if shes cutting you for being late and she obviously cut you for being late so tell her you understand and are still happy she even wants you at her wedding because if it were me i would be glad you were debating not going so i didnt have to figure out how to polite ghost you
thats fair the few times ive ever needed to sob i wore myself out within like 10 minutes maybe 30 if im assuming i grossly am miscalculating the time but i couldnt even physically imagine sobbingscreaming for 90 minutes and still being able to effectively breathe at that point i get stuffed up and a migraine so quickly when i cry
also remember if youre basically preparing for them to be unhappy either way might as well wait and enjoy the peace while you can its not like theyll be happy if you tell them early youre just making yourself unhappy all that much sooner
and in that same strain plenty of addicts need to cope by completely and totally removing their vice from their life if op has moved forward through moving on it may be true that regardless of the amount of progress made now that this friend needs to always remain in the past much like you would never tell a coke addict they can probably handle having coke in their life again it may be a similar situation here its okay to have limitations it doesnt mean you arent reformed
eh it isnt fair to think people can say thats enough with emotions but you definitely can control if youre sobbingscreaming vs just crying uncontrollably and maybe heavy breathing ive had those days where i cant stop crying for hours at a time but silently
nta but also you may be shooting yourself in the foot here what does your lease say are you responsible for the rent unless she finds someone else to takeover because if youre on the lease its still your responsibility regardless of if you live there or not
i mean yeah personally if my partner was considering ending our relationship because of issues especially something legitimate that ive been doing i absolutely want to know who the heck would genuinely say theyd actually prefer to be left in the dark and give up the ability to save their marriage just because theyre afraid of a hard conversation

pretty much everyone ever that i have known who was blindsided wishes their partner wouldve just said when they were starting to think of leaving so it could be fixed
good actual communication can overcome way more relationship issues than people give credit to
ok so talk to her about that you dont see the blatant hypocrisy in your statement youre just as guilty of the same things she is youre trying to leave her in the dark over a huge thought youre having rather than just telling her what youre thinking stop that be better
yeah if youre that bothered youre updating your facebook status in the bathroom my comment stands op was bothered enough to take action if theyre that easily bothered they arent compatible with small office culture unless youre in a mega corporation generally small offices will have talks like this especially since its incredibly benign to say something along the lines of thank god he was looking out for my husband it isnt exactly a controversial statement even atheists often use that sort of language
that isnt really true if you cant handle having or even hearing any sort of conversation that isnt strictly about work and nothing else not even something as meaningful as a cancer scare then you need to go work in a giant conglomerate where coworkers arent actually meant to be people and are just meant to be cogs in the machine everywhere else though coworkers are often some form of friends even if its only during work
believe it or not but it isnt u professional to have a discussion about a coworker you have a relationship with it isnt like they were trying to convert op they were simply discussing their experiences and how they felt luckylooked out for that their husbands mass was found early
maybe a pea coat or a trench would give you what youre looking for but can still have a fitted waist to give you some shape
it may just be the dress you have underneath but this doesnt work for me you look like youre drowning in so much fabric
or even just dont put glasses on the floor theres obviously a side table right nearby im not sure why this is even a habit at all let alone the act of leaving them the issue isnt really her forgetting the glass out because she does all the chores and people are allowed to forget things once in awhile but also just dont put your glass on the floor and then when you forget it out itll be on the table and not a tripping hazard
or he just got fed up and she refused to take any form of accountability and just shifted blame so he decided to leave im not saying either of them are totally at fault but lets also not act like either of them is totally blameless either id say its way more okay to have a half cup of coffee next to the laptop if youre working in the living room than it is to leave a glass of water as a tripping hazard in the direct foot path of people in the house
if youre in the wrong for anything its that youre not taking it badly enough thats just how bad it is what he said
as much as it was obvious he wasnt performing to standard today i also want to remind people he is a real human being and likely is worried about more than just this match with everything going on with kyedae and to keep the flaming to a minimum it isnt going to help him improve and it honestly cant feel good for him to hear people shitting on him everyone has bad days and even if you think hes inconsistent it could be due to his entire world turning upside down within the past month
ok op you need to realize there is no saving the kids it sucks but both of their parents are literal nazis the kids either will or wont take after their parents but unless youre going to do away with the nazi father which do not im trying to simply illustrate you need to accept the kids will turn out how they are destined to turn out then you need to accept that the kids got fucked with their parents 

reach out to the kids when theyre older if youre so inclined to protect them but at this point you cant do anything you need to just accept tank your cousin is now and stand up for your values
a little late is definitely 15 minutes not over an hour i would definitely be more than a little annoyed if someone showed up to a meal over an hour late without explicitly stating that theres almost no restaurant ive ever been to where an hour and 15 minutes in i havent gotten and eaten my food already at that point honestly just dont come if youre going to be that late as it defeats the whole purpose of going out for food especially if it was just brunch and not like brunch and shopping or something else afterwards 

that being said the friends still fucked up and glad they took responsibility for it
im proud of you youve come to this decision a lot easier than most wouldhave it isnt fixable and its ultimately a waste of time that you could spend with someone who actually loves you to even try to fix this just make arrangements for a divorce lawyer and you should legally be allowed to use your joint money to pay but check on your area and serve him with papers make sure to keep a friend or some family in the loop and have an emergency crash on the couch arrangement if you really need just in case if youre able to start applying for jobs or disability or some form of income 

and if he suddenly starts with i want to make this work then you can simply reply if you were ever interested in being a good husband you shouldve done that from the beginning not once ive decided ive had enough
is there anyone with knowledge who can explain to me how an arranged marriage can happen where the groom and his entire family hate the bride and her family because i still find that part so confusing
you should speak to a professional theres a lot of things that could be going on and youre right if you dont solve this youll end up either unhappy alone or both a therapist will help if youre willing to put in the work
has he actually said that though because devils advocate in me thinks theres a chance he also just might have work you still dont need to go ofc
also consider that youre violating your ex by showing someone else a sex tape of her with her face in full view personally that would be my bigger issue as now id be terrified of any nudes or videos wed takensent being something you either have or might share 

delete everything you have of any other woman on your phone tell her you understand that this was a violation on multiple levels of multiple people and you understand you were a fool and youve gotten your ass handed to you and are never going to do something like that again and then dont because holy shit your poor ex
1 youre assuming he doesnt want kids and knew he never wanted them that isnt actually stated 2 hes allowed to change his mind hes allowed to withdraw consent everyone is its crazy to argue that because shell lose out on something that his consent no longer should matter imagine making that argument for a woman its gross same thing here morally he can just as easily get a sperm donor or do ivf with a sperm donor and implant that embryo
well the problem is you didnt tell him because you were afraid of him wanting your money you now know its not a fear its reality you do sound naive because you are failing to realize even if you couldve worked through the issues before you cant and shouldnt work through my boyfriend is a gold digger or potential financial abuser interested in taking or controlling my money
sure maybe she cant but to be clear theres nothing saying she cant sue and win for the cost of ivf but the answer isnt to take any another persons consent in creating a life that doesnt yet exist
which is why i said regardless of the legal aspect morally he should be given the right to withdraw consent
well remember that youve made these changes for yourself and your marriage not to be praised
it fell off in the house and you noticed within 30 minutes text him and ask for help looking when he comes home at the end of the day if your partner is upset over a one time accident that says more about him than you 

that being said just a tip whenever i put on jewelry with a clasp the first thing i do is give it a little tug to make sure its really on properly and not just appearing to be secured necklaces can be clasped just the wrong way where they stay on but once you tug it it slipped out of the clasp good habit to form to minimize unfortunate accidents but at the end of the day its still just an unfortunate accident
to be honest i never understood people who say dont accuse someone because for all you know theyre using the condoms for masturbation

thats pretty uncommon and frankly if thats the case as long as you dont accuse someone like a maniac theyll simply respond to the accusation with the real reason be aware that maybe there are other reasons but thats like someone saying all hooves are zebras unless you live in africa those hooves are horses 999999 of the time
ok well unfortunately your mistake had a pretty direct hand in turning this dude into a misogynist you can want whatever that doesnt change the reality youre dating a misogynist and not only that but youre dating a man who rightfully resent the woman who allowed him to be bullied when he was less attractive and never stood up for him you arent going to overcome this if youre embarrassed to be with him youd better cut your losses because quite frankly you being in his life is part of the problem because youre a direct confirmation of everything thats fueling him people treating him better as soon as he got attractive
just to say even if youre legally in the clear morally you should allow this man autonomy over his own progeny i understand there is a cost associated with either getting a sperm donor or doing ivf with someone else but please do not take away his consent to bring his child into the world men and women should be allowed this right sue him for the cost of the ivf and even what it would cost to do it again with a sperm donor but dont bring a child hes clearly stated he doesnt want into the world against his consent
nta but moving forward upon ordering ask for separate checks not only does that make things way easier for the waiter it makes it clear to lynher boyfriend that whatever they order is fully on them 

its best to learn ways of dealing with difficult people in a way that isnt directly confronting them its unclear if you actually said to the waiter i want separate checks so i dont pay for the other couple but if you did probably best to just address things as i suggested instead because passive aggressive and snide remarks about your girlfriends best friend in front of said best friend without ever saying trying anything else is also not the most mature way of handling things and is bound to rub your gf the wrong way regardless of how in the right you are
hey its clear youre in denial but you dont need to apologize to us the only one who suffers here is you just remember that
are you his first girlfriend im going to assume you are or at least youre the first girlfriend to want to have physical intimacy kissing hugging sex etc and he asked you out unaware that he wouldnt like it but he doesnt and hes probably really unsure why himself i would say more likely than not this has to do more with him his feelings his identity and his journey than it has anything to do with you i understand that sucks but i would very gracefully break up with him just send him a text it feels like were friends not in a relationship i think it would be better for us to just be friends from now on
well if you want the real talk maybe you wont ever be absolutely sure and in that case dont ever get married marriage isnt something you should take lightly and frankly much like children i believe plenty of people out there simply will never be fit for marriage if you cant do it right dont do it not when your decisions can have such huge effect on the lives of others both in the person you would be marrying while unsure and of the kids you may have with her
id probably speak to a therapist as it sounds like youre struggling with empathy
well sounds like even if you could trust him before in the past youre no longer able to trust him now as youve caught him in multiple lies 

hes turning into an addict and a liar and when you combined that with the fact that 1 he has additional traits you dont like and dont seem to have touched upon here and 2 youre on reddit asking strangers if you should break up means this

this isnt the life you want for yourself and you know that this is the life you will have if you stay it sucks because you love so much about him and you wish you could just make him into that perfect person you have in your head but he isnt and as time goes on its becoming harder and harder for you to convince yourself hes close enough to being that person its true that no one is perfect and we all fight and have flaws but the reality is this isnt working and it probably hasnt really worked in a lot longer than you want to admit but the longer you stay the longer itll take to not only get over this relationship but also to find the person who doesnt make you feel this way not only that but staying with someone like this is only going to leave you with issues that make you a worse partner in the future 

all in all he may want to stop but you cant keep waiting around for him to stop even without the drugs probably if you were honest with yourself this wasnt a man that youd want to stay with even if you didnt love him
im not sure how much this really means if the next most watched game without 4 of the most popular female streamers playing in it was less than 10k viewers
i also think hes probably putting the blame on the cat when he should be looking at himself 

uimpossiblesign6754 if you are noticing your wife is relying more on a cat than her own husband for emotional support instead of trying to get rid of the cat start asking yourself why you arent the one giving her the emotional support more likely than not youre not actually there for your wife so of course shes going to rely on the cat who is
you should just tell her im happy to pay for you but anything your sister wants how about you cover yourself good compromise
they definitely left because they were homophobic not because they were blindsided you can be surprised someone has two fathers but if youre not homophobic your first thought will definitely not be to get up and leave with absolutely no explanation if for no other reason than because you know how homophobic it looks and generally wouldnt want to come off as such i could maybe see this being a topic of conversation after dinner but no semitolerant person storms off like that without even saying anything to the effect of wow i feel like you were purposefully hiding something from me i feel like you may be hiding other things and i dont think its a good idea for us to have a dinner right now
ok but heres the issue if the money is just meant to be passed along generation to generation no one ever is going to use it right if thats the case 1 the kids shouldnt be upset as it wouldnt have been money they intended to use and 2 thats foolish because hoarding money so you can say you have it but never actually doing anything with it is part of the reason theres so much wealth disparity in the world 

money should be spent responsibly of course but him enjoying the rest of his life and making sure hes able to care for himself is why the money exists if his kids dont want him to rely on them then they shouldnt rely on him to give a full inheritance independence goes both ways
gunna be honest both of you sound toxic and are trying to hide behind jokes and quick wit when the reality is you are both just bitter and bad partners you probably arent good for each other because and especially neither of you seem ready to be with anyone you cant control him but you can control yourself do some selfreflection and work to undo the unhealthy behaviors youre forming so you can find and keep a partner who will also not treat you like shit


im also going to add never once have i looked down into my cup and seen anything looking back at me while insulting your family is so far out of line i cant even begin i also cant say i wouldnt also be disgusted if my partner was drinking from a straw with crap growing in it
maybe tell her its clear this is becoming an issue and you want to discuss this constructively before it causes permanent damage to your marriage so youve booked an appointment with a couples therapist
if you cant do that are you prepared to be the one putting in 100 of the effort again because those are the options he likes you because you dote on and borderline worship him if you stop doing those things he isnt going to chase after you it sucks but thats the reality pick whatever you perceive as the lesser of two evils 


but just remember as much as you feel like you cant do it you can and the sooner you start the sooner you realize wow how did i ever think losing him was that hard
dont make yourself miserable because youre afraid of your family thinking less of you its okay to make mistakes its okay to want the best from those you love but it isnt okay to be miserable because youre afraid of potential judgement your family may just be happy youre finally rid of him so dont stay because youre afraid of what others will think if you leave
i would maybe consider that you also arent who you think you are either im not saying this was your fault but you show a shocking lack of awareness of what id consider the basic status of both your relationship and partners general life its very possible this is all your partners doing but id probably guess you could also do some work on yourself so you can be a better partner in a future relationship with a woman who hopefully will deserve that trust
i like the pants but the top throws off your proportions you have a wider waist and smaller chest so you probably want a top that creates a more flared illusion sweetheart necklines or even a ruffled top would help to even out your proportions a bit
well he clearly thought she loved him more than she loved herself 

the unfortunate thing is for at least three years he was right men and women need to remember that if you arent your own priority youre doing something wrong within reason please dont be selfabsorbed just know your worth
yeah especially since presumably she was dating the exfianc for some length of time meaning this couldve potentially gone down only a few months before they met
its definitely better for jj oops husband thinks jj is immature for not having a boyfriend thats not the kind of energy i would want in my life everything else not even considered
not really saying we need to start working on this and making progress because i know this is an issue i cant live with forever but im still willing to work on it now is different than an ultimatum which is effectively make this dramatic change right now or were done
honestly to answer your question yeah i do think youd be a monster to issue an ultimatum of let me cheat or ill leave you instead tell him i cant stay in a relationship without intimacy we either need to work on this together or we need to reevaluate our marriage because this isnt working for me if he offers an open relationship then sure but to coerce him into an open marriage nah fam if youre unhappy you leave you dont do that
honestly i think this fit will come down more to your size than your height it looks good because of her figure
did you ever pause and think maybe your son doesnt respect you two because you dole out a harsher punishment for speaking out against racism than the racism itself 

id say no offense but i actually mean offense when i say if you arent racist get your shit together because youre coming off very racist right now just in the i have a black friend of course im not racist kind of way that 21st century racists all seem to thrive people seem to think refusing to use a slur means you arent racist and trust me its a lot more complicated than that
most likely because you understand that actions have consequences and anyone can push things too far she likely thought after 5 years they were essentially one so even if he didnt like what she was doing he wouldnt stop it which is a bold choice
if shes lucky 50k year at 27 with no working history and no info on what her degree would be a godsend
it never ceases to amaze me how someone can so confidently refuse to compromise because they firmly believe they hold all the power and so quickly backtrack when they realize theyll lose everything over being unwilling to lose anything
you should really only use force as a last resort you should try bribesmasking before you resort to shoving the pill down their throat
i dont recommend this but at least in your head say there may be many women who would ask for less but there are also many men who will give so much more

you deserve better
yeah im so so so sorry that this is happening to you but its very clear that he thinks youre trapped now there is no changing him and given everything youve just told me i think its most likely he will both cheat and turn physical 

make a decision without him i understand this is hard to come to terms with so if it takes you time to come to the decision thats okay but if you decide to leave him and i would seriously consider it make sure you have everything lined up and never mention a word to him you may need to ask family for help friends make new accounts whatever it takes to ensure he doesnt find out youre honestly very likely in danger right now secrecy is your best friend be careful op if you need resources i can link you to someone who will be able to help more than me
i also think the title is misleading she isnt actually saying maria cant be vegan but shes saying that maria needs to stop demanding specialty vegan items like fake meat fake cheese fake butter etc if shes vegan on principle good for her but she needs to decide between a plain old saladpasta with tofu or going hungry because its ridiculous to expect everyone else starve and get inadequate nutrition just so maria can have the fancy vegan foods
make sure to check the reviews i always raise an eyebrow at affordable dresses that require decent construction to look good would suck to waste a couple hundred on a dress that ended up looking cheap
the reality is your husband wants a traditional wife he wants a woman whos sole existence is to serve him and his family your role is to cook for him take care of him bear and rear as many or as few kids as he desires and put up with whatever he wants he makes a bunch of money and he feels as though thats his right as not only a man but a successful man 

i get everyone on reddit telling you not to tolerate it and you shouldnt but you need to be hyper realistic about the situation youre in he isnt going to change there is no point in trying to convince him if you try to change him one of two i guess three things is going to happen he will leave you cheat on you or become violent hes already become angry with you for beginning to challenge him so do not doubt the possibility that he will become physical 

you need to simply decide if your and his views on what a marriage should be are compatible and they very well may not be but if this isnt what you want you need to make plans to leave not plans to stand up for him otherwise you may be in physical danger or at a minimum left in a situation with no plan he may become vengeful in a divorce and do everything he can to take everything from you and leave you with even less than you came into the marriage with i cant impress upon you that the choices are either accept the marriage he wants or do not say anything until youre in a position to quickly and safely leave
youd be very wise to involve your father not only for your sisters safety but for your boyfriends safety you need to tell anyone and everyone what your sister is doing and make it clear this isnt consensual and protect your boyfriend because this is how false accusations usually arise your sister may not take the rejection well seeing as any semi sane individual wouldnt tell her sister shes going to pursue her boyfriend of 4 years so youre already dealing with someone who isnt all there when it comes to following social norms be careful and protect yourself and your boyfriend the sooner someone can step in and knock some sense into her the better
as much as i understand you dont think its weaponized incompetence it is definitely still incompetence i have never ruined a single dinner timer or not because i am paying attention to the meal i would never walk away from a kitchen appliance thats turned on i have never messed up a load of laundry like that because i always check to make sure to fully check hands inside the machine that it is empty before and after a load of laundry ive never had any furniture tvs or anything of the sort break on me because i test to make sure things are installed properly after i finish he cant prevent the actions of others the late drivers and rear end accidents arent him but youre allowing him to blame way more than he should on this nebulous im cursed idea when the reality is he simply isnt going through life intelligently especially because if you know youre that unlucky youll learn quickly ways around it you two have been together years and perhaps even live together if youre eating the same food the fact that you dont get food poisoning and he does probably means he isnt using good food hygiene for the food only hes eating as bacteria doesnt selectively decide to attack him and leave you alone 

this is a classic example of one crappy encounter happens two is unlucky is every encounter sucks the problem is you not them i get it you love him you want to believe this person you love is totally helpless to do anything to stop this unfortunate string of events but he isnt until and unless he understands that hes allowing himself to a victim more than he needs and why given he seems so predisposed to the inevitable and takes steps to course correct youd be fully within your right to leave someone who doesnt understand something so basic as dont leave cooking food unattended that i learned that when i was 8 years old and started cooking
probably didnt see the context of he was sleeping on an air mattress in someone elses room i was initially thinking he was the ah for making a big deal over 200 but given he doesnt even get an actual place to stay yeah its time to put the foot down imo
its probably an overreaction to say quit him but i agree op needs to simply put her foot down i am not quitting my etsy store if the time comes where i need to go back to being a waitress i will but being a waitress is a dead end job and one i can get at any time with any resume i am going to put my focus where i am happy and making more money until that changes i understand your concerns so if my business starts to fail ill definitely figure something else out but you do not get to unilaterally tell me to quit my business especially not to go back to waitressing of all jobs its utter ridiculous of you to suggest such a foolish business move
it likely doesnt take much luck if you a come from a rich family or b have the mother of the child do all of the child care while you focus on school and then your career the kids were all by the same woman it seems you have no idea if that woman was well off or what but its definitely possible
people seem very unaware that in the franchisedascension league teams are no longer free to make changes whenever they want but yes the rosters are as they are unless there is some emergency transfer allowed by riot which would only be for extenuating circumstances this is a good thing for the scene overall though as rosters that just make a change after any bad performance are going to perform worse than the teams that work at chemistry and accept that the path to success is rarely ever straight up
to me thats hard to say he might absolutely but he just as easily might not theres 5 teams currently and will be 6 teams by next year im sure changes will be made to franchised teams no doubt but its a combination of depends on what his salary and geographic requirements are combined with what the scene looks like by then a lot can happen in a year in fact yay went from relatively unknown to dominant superstar in less than a year there is nothing to stop that happening again to someone else and based on the trajectory of the scene thus far i actually bet it does happen again the issue is when theres only 30 franchised players and only 56 slots for your particular role it probably isnt a great risk to take saying eh ill just take a year off and come back later because frankly you may not have that option yay has a very particular role he fills with a very particular play style he excels in and he does it well but when youre the best in a niche field you need prominence to ensure relevance and that doesnt happen in a world where he doesnt compete and rarely streams i mean he hasnt even updated his twitch to remove c9 from the about tab and frankly unless yay has a backup plan for his career lined up that isnt a risk id personally want to take when were talking about his actual livelihood here it may not be as glamorous as he would want but it definitely beats becomingstaying unemployed
well i think people on here in the comments have knee jerk reactions as a result of the people in the posts ignoring numerous red flags the problem is they see where the red flags tend not always of course lead and as a result have a hairpin trigger on convincing people to expect more for themselves and stop ignoring such blatant issues 

however if the people on here were always really intuned with how much these red flags can turn into relationship enders and instead only ever came here for advice on i messed up i forgot my wifes birthday how do i make it up to her or my partner and i disagree on how to handle xyz how do we come to an agreement people would probably be a lot less likely to jump to this relationship is unhealthy you see the issue 

instead this guy is recognizing the dynamic is unhealthy right away and opting out which is the smarter way to go about dating it means that when the issues do arise they tend to be manageable issues and with someone who hopefully will be able and willing to work on those issues with you
yay wins because he wont be knocked out of the competitive scene for a year ranked is terrible for practicing for pro play and being out of practice with scrims meta and competitive performances could really hurt him in the long run valorant is a game where recency plays a huge role in your value and in a year of franchising with no yay and however many other newupcoming players dominating he could find himself with no prospects again definitely yay has an incentive to be playing and be showing the world he is still very much a top performer compared to all the other talent out there and he does that by competing not by sitting and playing ranked
well believe it or not most likely the getting all up in his over his eye color had to do with his race her brother getting hostileaggressive could be taken as borderline abusive and ops lack of either a warning about her familys behavior nor any attempt to run interference or set boundariesstand up for him show an unhealthy dynamic that can easily turn toxic 

its not silly for someone to see the red flags for what they are right away and not wait for the silly to turn unbearable in fact if everyone acted the way this guy did people would both be happier in general and also those who refuse to make changes in their lives that would protect their so would be forced to because theyd just keep ending up alone otherwise
yes and no anger will consume you if you let it learning emotional maturity is learning how to not allow your emotions to rule you and often part of that is learning how to since you seem to like frozen let things go so while yes its a nuanced topic moving on from something does often involve choosing and actively working on not allowing those emotions to control you anymore sure if you think about it you might still feel those things but its semantics to make the argument about whether or not active or passive feelings of anger are still being angry about something in short yes being an adult means you need to be able to choose when to actively feel emotions vs accepting that you do feel a certain way about something but refusing to allow that emotion to control your life the attitude of she should remain angry forever is frankly unhealthy and lacks any sort of emotional maturity 

she can be angry but she ultimately needs to decide if shes going to let that anger rule her life or not and yes most adults are 100 capable of choosing not to be so angry about something anymore if youre unable to consider you may not have adequate emotional control 

imo it isnt worth it for her to remain angry because the ring was given to her cousin without conditions and regardless of its alterations op wasnt given the ring so there is no additional loss to her as already the ring wasnt and wouldnt be hers it sucks she can mourn the loss of a beautiful ring get it remade for her if she so chooses now free of guilt
well people can actively to choose to move on from a situation theyre hurt about the point of the comment is a very pragmatic one either make this a hill to die on and cause familial tensions or accept that whats done is done it was technically given to her without conditions of keeping it as is and as much as it hurts that hurt can remain a personal one 

forgiveness is often a choice someone actively makes not one that simply happens and its one that is often made not for the person being forgiven but for themselves yes its hard but part of being an adult is being able to manage your emotions that doesnt mean to just get rid of them but you should be able to manage them enough to be able to move forward
even the 2030 lbs tvs of today could definitely kill a toddler if it fell the wrong way that poor child but thank god oop lives in a country with strong intervention for at risk children
i assume the most likely reason for his overreaction was he may be unaware pancada has said he finds playing smokes boring despite being really good at it and thus assumed this was being done against his best interest my guess this was brought up and syyko is enabling pancada in a way even loud wasnt abledidnt want to
and against any medical practice policies that you wouldnt be horrified to go to even most fast food restaurants say you cant wear a ring if itll risk tearing your gloves yet op thinks a cardiologist should have worse hygiene than a burger king

i mean if you really want to be real the problem is she accepts it
unless i missed something i think ultimately the friend simply isnt going to attend op didnt say anything to me that came off as trying to force her to attend without hans just that she cant attend with him as it would make it so the mother of the groom wouldnt feel comfortable attending her own sons wedding
right and as long as op isnt forcing the friend to come without the dog and accepts the friend simply will be unable to attend all is well but its completely fair for op to say i fully understand you cant be without hans unfortunately my mil is uncomfortable around even the most well behaved dogs due to her own trauma as much as i would love to have you there i wont ask either of you to be uncomfortable can we celebrate together the four of us you me hans and groom on our own
in public yes 100000 but this isnt public this is a private event where she isnt required to attend if she doesnt feel comfortable going without her service animal she shouldnt but to act as though her being able to attend comes before making sure her husband can have his mom at his own wedding is also an odd take i for one would really be second guessing a marriage where my stbw made it so my mother wouldnt attend my wedding
she is nta for ensuring her husbands mother feels comfortable at her wedding over her friend however unfortunately this means the friend should simply not go to the wedding its unfortunate but the friend is not required to go to the wedding and her presence isnt a priority compared to her husbands mother
uhm yeah actually your post aside it can 100000 be rude to tell someone something objectively true for example you look really fat in that dress can both be objectively true and rude af to say to someone even your tone can take something from being not rude to rude like id say your attitude was for example hey id prefer to go to the movies alone if thats okay but we can have dinner after vs really you cant possibly think id want to go to the movies with you im going alone its true you dont want to go with that person but the first is polite and the second is rude
no you may feel you have to move now because youd prefer to run alone if the option is there but definitely understand that thats a choice youre making not being force to make and you can make that choice silently if you feel uncomfortable fine but no one else needs to hear why youre moving just move
she most definitely accosted him you can feel she was justified in doing so and therefore isnt an ah for it but she was 100 accosting him for using the treadmill next to her
in the future dont say anything just silently move to another treadmill on the off chance that this guy has unrelated reasons for using that particular machine it prevents you from acting rude and even if he did want to impose on you moving without the confrontation will just annoy him and keep you safer 


i would say if he made a complaint as is youd be partially in the wrong as he does have a right to use the equipment regardless of if there are other machines free without you acting like he was doing something wrong and guys like that are definitely the type to make a complaint so its better to just get up and move rather than confront it either wasnt on purpose in which case confronting him is an ah move or it was on purpose and youll convey the message loud and clear without ever having to interact win win
why not just have your sister text her and see if it goes through on her end thats a pretty surefire way to know if shes blocked you
that is not true at all that was true in the peak of covid which is no longer really a concern its a tourist economy the lack of tourism is hurting a number of the locals and the ask was strictly because the hospital infrastructure isnt equipped to handle large influxes of inpatient care and being an island in the middle of the ocean alternatives for those who need it is effectively impossible
its 30 not 50 theres 14 guests  opgroom and i assume theyll have a slightly nicer setup for themselves as itll double as a honeymoon so 2116  13125 an 30 increase if you assume opgroom dont splurge on themselves and if you assume a linear ppp which most likely shed do a double bed and couch setup for the sister and family making it less than other guests which are presumably primarily couples 


doesnt change it the flights alone on a last minute trip to hawaii are nuts and why spend that much money you 1 dont havedidnt plan on and 2 on someone who really isnt there to celebrate your relationship just wants a free trip
im sorry for not inviting you i figured since you said no due to time away from work and difficulty handling the long travel time with the kids that a longer and harder to get to location would be the opposite of easier for you guys but id still love to have you if youre able to join i can send you the flight and hotel details unfortunately you will need to cover your travelaccommodations as the plans i made were based on those who rsvpd yes only and weve already used our budget if you cant spend the money or the time due to it being your busy season i more than understand and hopefully we can get together once things settle down for us both more if you need to think about it no worries just be sure to let me know by whatever date you want so i can make sure to get extra tickets for the activities i planned
your bosss success compared to his bosss doesnt have anything to do with the idea that your potential ex may try to sabotage your career
you can also give him some benefit of the doubt especially because you still come to the same conclusion if hes being caused such deep emotional distress that hes ask you to quit your job after seeing just how low you were at one point that means you are just as unhealthy for him as he is for you at that point even if hes being totally genuine in his feelings the conclusion is the same i love you and i dont want to keep hurting you but if itll take me quitting my career for you to not be hurt unfortunately at this point its for the best we part ways we both have our demons and it seems like they cant play nice with each other im not giving up my job but i also will not stick around and trigger you either please get some therapy its a life changer if our paths cross one day and were both in a place to lift one another up maybe things will be different but for now i think i should move out so you can focus on yourself and your well being
i hope it isnt true but that was my thought as well either that or im unfortunately guessing he probably isnt the cleanest person to live with because i would definitely notice and clean up any blood left on the floor regardless but especially if caused by something i was ashamed of
i have no agenda and a number of oops comments have been deletedremoved and show a very different side of oop he was attacking anyone who disagreed with him insulting them and doubling down on the idea that family should come first after being criticized by multiple people it seems his attitude has softened significantly which is good but multiple people on a number of threads have said the same thing the repeated use of the language blood family should come first and calling an obvious abuse victim spineless doesnt sit right with many people the point is the repeated context in which it was used felt less like you shouldnt allow yourself to be manipulated and more like you should simply side with family because were blood and were here first including in the first few comments that were made on this thread thankfully oop has admitted the wording was wrong and emotions were high but i stand by my statement both generally and in the way many felt it was being used in this context and understand you likely didnt see many of oops earlier comments in this thread as he appeared to be deleting them when they werent well received
fair always is dangerous language however i believe that when you take a marriage vow you need to be prepared to make that person and family you make together your priority over your blood family
i stand by what i say fully it is disgusting to say you think blood family should be the priority its completely fair to say you think his values which clearly his fiance was in direct opposition to should be his priority but how you phrased it is something i disagree with extensively i fully stand by that dont double down on the context as that only implies you do think blood family takes precedence over a life partner which when that life partner is actually in alliance with you is 100 a disgusting statement

quite honestly you honestly seemed to have an air of blaming your brother for not sticking with you simply on principle without recognizing the complexities of abuse and that makes can still be victim to toxic relationships im sorry that youre upset i take issue with that but i do
thats good you recognize that a healthy partner should always come before blood family the way you wrote that post definitely indicates otherwise im glad your brother was able to see reason and get out of an unhealthy relationship
as much as oop was right that this woman wasnt right for hisher brother im surprised no one has pointed out the idea that blood family should always be the priority over your fiance no matter what is also a disgusting view assuming you and your future life partner are aligned in values you should 100 always pick your life partner over blood family the idea that your sibling should be a priority over a life partner in cases other than such extreme hatred isolation and abuse is horrendous and based on how many times oop brought up the idea of he should stand by his blood family makes me feel like this isnt extenuating circumstance and oop just believes this is what you do i hope oop changes their mind before getting into a ltr if theyre interested in them because my heart hurts for all the people out there in unhappy marriages because their partners hold them in second place to mommydaddywhoever else in the name of family
sure but that will probably become apparently relatively quickly and can be addressed then as long as youre not depriving your child of any form of food for months seems like a fine strategy to at least try
i read this as crows initially and had to zoom in in order to definitely say those definitely are not crows
i mean realistically speaking thats because if a partner was going to negatively talk about body count its going to be towards a female i would be more surprised if i saw someone judging a man for sleeping with 100 girls in college quite honestly
generally speaking it gets around when youre all friends in college
you should probably read again i said this isnt a legal issue specifically where it pertains to her lying and saying he raped her i never said sexual assault isnt illegal i was specifically replying to the idea he should report it to the police for fear of her flipping the narrative
he honestly isnt working that much yes its a lot but plenty of people do it the real issue is hes leaving for work at or around 12 pm if a 1213 hour day has him home at almost 2 am depending on her work hours that means they probably never see each other he needs to get his hours in check and start working wayyy earlier so that him and his wife can share meals together but honestly i have no sympathy for someone who expects his wife to work 30 hours a week do all the chores and then stay up past midnight to have a home cooked meal ready for him in the middle of the night 

this would be a totally different story if he was getting up at 5 am and getting home at 79 pm and expecting her to cook something quick or have take out or whatever but these timeframes are totally unreasonable and unnecessary
to be honest the part everyone seems to be overlooking is if hes coming home at 130 am after a 1213 hour day that means hes leaving for work at noon he needs to start going into work at 67 am and getting home at a normal hour so its reasonable to expect a meal ready for him but its ludicrous to be going into work that late staying that long and still expecting your wife to stay up past midnight to then cook

if he were coming home even at 9 pm i would be fully on his side coming home at almost 2 am fuck no
im not saying it isnt im just saying this isnt a legal issue re she could lie and say he raped her no sex happened in the us actual rapists with evidence go free but you cant have evidence of what didnt happen and unfortunately even though he was sexually assaulted male victims have even less chance of legal success than female victims however filing the report will at least substantiate ops experience even if no consequences befall her 

and like i said if ops girlfriend doesnt believe him even after he has gone to her multiple times then hes learned a valuable lesson about how she prioritizes him so he can gtfo
she could but since op was smart and went to gf about this before its consistent this wont be a legal issue sex never happened he got a bj and without any evidence of any sex let alone nonconsensual sex op really doesnt need to worry about a rape charge not in the us at least if his gf doesnt believe him ultimately its better for him to know she isnt someone who will have his back and he can leave
the staff didnt side with her and theres nothing about anyone else agreeing it was simply she had an attitude i had one back the staff told us we were both able to use the equipment as we wished unless you see information not im the op but how youre portraying it is very different than how the op portrays things
you do seem to be dragging your feet a bit on the legal side of things just to warn you that could seriously hurt you in the long run just be careful
i mean if communication is important to you i wouldnt stay with someone who doesnt communicate i get it sucks but that just isnt who she is you should love someone for who they are not who you want them to be
yes i agree but also recognize that there are some people who take undue offense to what most would consider normal so as much as it may depend on him recognize that it doesnt all depend on him this is so much an issue where women assume the worst of guys in the gym where its a growing trend on tiktok for girls to film and watch for anyone who glances at them just to start a fight its entirely possible that she may have also just assumed he was staring at her when he wasnt im not really speculating who was doing what because theres ultimately no way to know except that even if he were standing too close for her preference in a gym environment or really any if you come at someone with an attitude like she did you should expect an attitude in return it really isnt an abnormal social interaction
even if you regret it in the future you can mourn him then theres no reason or expectation that mourning a life can only occur at a funeral with people to watch you grieve if you dont want to go now dont and whenif that ever changes decide how you want to remember him then
let him blame you at the end of the day if him blaming you is what it takes for you to find a bigger better relationship far away from a cheater like him thats a small price to pay
i mean i dont necessarily think its sincere but i am saying that if you immediate attack anyone even trying they will stop trying
thats fair enough i will say i take it you were probably a bit more polite than it seems the woman in the story was but youre totally entitled to your opinions and experiences i think to me ops answer seems a bit more normal as i get the impression the woman also had an attitude to start and you tend to get what you give so i dont really find op an ah for responding to an attitude with an attitude but im glad you havent had that experience
no she said she was convinced her intentions were good and realized they werent and her actions came from a place of judgment which was wrong
yeah it is glaring obvious who does and doesnt go to the gym in this thread to the surprise of no one most people on aita clearly are not avid gym goers
out of curiosity do you go to a busy gym because youre totally entitled to your opinion but its 100 normal expected and required in a busy gym to stand close enough to a desired piece of equipment that as soon as the person gets up from their set they can move up and take the equipment otherwise someone will take your place this comes down to if the woman isnt comfortable with that sort of environment thats totally fair but she probably needs to go either at a less busy time or a smaller gym

also im not trying to attack you im just curious if youre familiar with this sort of environment because i can see how someone who isnt familiar with busy gym etiquette may get to your conclusion
tbf if everyone in the thread is mischaracterizing his actions as something they clearly werent he can provide clarification people are out here acting like he was standing over glaring heavily and making tut tut noises while pointing at his watch when this sounds like completely normal gym interactions from someone who actually goes to a gym heads up gyms are filled with adrenaline and testosterone and women and men tend to be a bit testier than usual women often assume that everyone is leering at them and tend to want space and no one looking at them and men often just want the person theyre waiting on to get out of the way so they can do their set it sometimes leads to snarky interactions and its not that deep
they didnt actually they said they understood where op was coming from but shes allowed to do whatever exercise wherever she wants thats actually the opposite of saying hes out of line thats retail worker speak for i fully agree with you but this is my job and i need to not get in trouble
and believe it or not youre allowed to silently judge people he didnt say anything stop acting like you can police someones thought thats some orwellian bullshit right there
 youre gunna decide a person is an asshole for a silent thought dude thats just unreasonable the woman spoke to op first and told them to go away pretty sure op isnt the ah here
i mean she has a point though as far as i was a giant flaming asshole and now i realize it goes she got further than a lot of people ever do none of these comments recognize that though id probably caution people at least in their real life to be kinder to people who have any form of selfreflection because the fact that this person still got piles of hate for acknowledging they messed up just makes people never want to acknowledge their flaws to some extent she cannot undo what she did she can only reflect on her previous actions and try to learn from it in the future if we actually want the world to be a better place and for people to want to be better we all need to encourage people for trying that doesnt mean forgive their previous mistakes but endlessly hating on someone even when theyre trying to reflect on their behavior isnt the answer
yeah and then you realize really quickly someone who really loves you wouldnt hold you back and theyd probably move with you given he has nothing tying him to where he is i get how it feels but take it from an old curmudgeon like me you realize a lot of the things you were so sure of at 18 just arent true by the time youre 25 and then again when youre 35 youll find someone who loves you so much you never find yourself posting on reddit about how theyve made you feel guilty for achieving greatness

ive lost loves before that felt like i wouldve died without them but im still here and in the end i now realize those loves were there to teach me something and prepare me to be the person i was meant to rather than to accompany me in the journey but youll find that person i promise the road may be bumpy but itll be worth it
i think you should just be honest im going to great school you can either come with me or you can stay but i am going if this is where our paths diverge i can honestly say i loved every minute but i am not giving up on this dream i understand if you arent ready for this step but i am

i was in a similar situation many years ago i have no regrets and id pick my education every single time my parents always said if its meant to be itll work out and if it wasnt meant to be it isnt worth sacrificing your future for
does he have a therapist knowledgeable in addiction if not that should be the first step
sounds like she figured after 3 years marriage should be the next logical step but she realized that wasnt what she actually wanted it could be someone else it could be she wasnt ready it could just be that you two arent right for each other it doesnt mean you were a bad partner or theres anything wrong with you but not everyone is meant to marry each other be happy she realized and finally told you before the wedding rather than after and im glad youre okay
sometimes just the threat of it would be enough to get someone to back down
well it would probably be easier to trust if you waited to trust until someone has proven they are worth it ya know then you wouldnt constantly be having dudes breaking it youd just be weeding out the bad eggs without feeling like its a person affront
like i said before a person who when angry responds in a way to cause pain isnt marriage material you should aim for someone who even when angry is able to come at a conflict from a place of love
you have time take a breather moving forward table any serious discussion of marriage engagement moving in etc until you feel like you actually know a person and there arent any massive flags thrown out if this is about a rush to the aisle youll end up there a lot quicker and only once if you take your time and make sure its right the first time
plenty of mcdonalds are 24 hours still weird but possible explanation as to why no one checked
girl youre a doormat stop believing what this therapist has to say and get your own therapist to work on your issues because youre about to be a mom and you need to work on your spine unless you want to get completely run over by the two kids youre about to have to raise on your own
as soon as you realize he doesnt actually care about your feelings he only cares about his you should stop caring about how much you love him because thats meaningless to him
fair enough good luck you seem to have a habit of rushing into situationships with men before you actually know if theyre worth the time investment id recommend slowing down and not jumping in head first with any guy who shows interest
i do have to ask how many men are you dating and why are you talking about marriage to a man you arent even faithful to you made a post 4 days ago that youve since deleted about a wealthy older indian man wanting to date you and you were considering it expect he was married before i feel like youre going through something but none of the information youre giving is actually honest as theres a common theme of you wanted to be the first wife
its ok to admit you cant move past it ive said it before and ill say it again never stay in a relationship with a person who when angry will say something just to hurt you that isnt who you commit to a lifetime with it shows theyre vindictive and cruel and neither are traits you need in a partner ive been angry before really angry i have never said to a person whom i intended to continue dating anything that i felt would hurt them just because i wanted to hurt them
you should both recognize youre career oriented and neither of you should give up your career goals for the other but those goals are in direct contradiction geographic incompatibility is a real thing and residency is long hard and time consuming if you think long distance relationships dont work let me tell you relationships in residency also dont usually work if you combined long distance and residency its a whole other beast to tackle if you already have doubts it aint worth it to invest another 23 years just to find out what you already know
youre in your final year of uni when do you graduate are you done in mayjune if so hold off until you graduate itll give you time to plan and get the logistics sorted start applying for jobs now either where you are or back home where your family is go to your universities career department to get in contact with alumni message recruiters on linkedin this all works way better than blindly applying network network network use being a student to your advantage there is no easier time to get a job than now 


as for how to get where youre going do you have a drivers license if so rent a car to get where youre going you can possibly take your bird on a train cover the bird during travel and get a travel cage that can fit either at your feet or on the seat next to you be realistic about how much it costs to transport things it may be cheaper to replace items than ship them i moved cross country twice in a very short period of time and the only thing i transported was clothing everything else was bought as cheap as possible and given to friends when i left vacuum bags are your best friend for getting as much as you can in your bagscar 

if you dont have a license but do have family willing to house you pay for a ticket for them to fly out and then rent the car to transport you and your stuff in the meantime you need some income look into on campus jobs the dining hall library cafes tutor centers etc all should have flexible hours and be okay with you working 515 hours a week for some pocket change save every penny work as much as youre able 

focus on 1 getting a part time job on campus if possible 2 getting a permanent job network network network 3 talking to family to see if they can help you and how 4 looking into how much it will cost to get where you need to go the further you have to travel the more it will be and ultimately make sure you dont try to take a bunch of stuff that will be cheap to replace but expensive to transport
im going to go against the grain but i would be uncomfortable if my partner went out in clothing like that personally nips showing for me are a no go and its pretty clear there were some nips showing its your body you are 100 in your right to do whatever you want but hes also allowed to be uncomfortable with it after 5 years together id personally expect my opinion to matter a bit to my partner i think you probably should decide if this is the hill to die on and if it is go forth but i wouldnt think wearing a shirt with no braundershirt or jacket or anything is worth making my partner feel as though youre looking for other mens attention i think youre nta but i get where hes coming from you clearly dont need to be with a guy who is uncomfortable with clothing like that though either ultimately may just be an incompatibility in your views
info do you actually have a choice because based on your description youre third in line after your grandparents and your aunts to get the land unfortunately if this is the case speak to a lawyer before responding because legally this might be the best youre actually going to get that doesnt make it right but you should get this info before deciding how to proceed because if you dont have leverage here legally youre going to need to proceed accordingly it honestly sounds like your family is legally entitled to take 100 of your inheritance if theyre so inclined and you wouldnt have any recourse if you irk them they may go this route
im fairly certain she isnt using an account with a 120 balance in it to provide the cash to close last i checked you need a lot more than that to even get approved for a mortgage and so theres obviously another account somewhere
again i do not you seem not to realize that apple has embedded software in the photos app that changes the video attributes when you copy a file this is exactly what was discussed by professionals and exactly why i said unless its an original the metadata is useless have a good day now
again that is incorrect like i said this was key information in a public trial last year where multiple professionals said copying a file does not save that exact information date time location etc on iphones unless a file is the original the metadata isnt usable im not going to argue any further i will take the experts opinion over a random redditor
looks super cute but needs a fun belt or even a flannel tied around the waist as it is its missing something but it definitely works
i do youre referring to the date with which a video was physically taken ie the day that ops gf was having sex if the video isnt the original which would track in her story the metadata wouldnt be in tact granted i believe you can tell if the video is an original if youre a forensic technician but laymen are unable to tell what youre trying to say the metadata will say 

copying a file alters the metadata simple as that and like i said before ill take a paid professional with a decade of experience and tons of lauded credentials saying this in a court of law over some rando on reddit contradicting it
this was a key point in a very public trial that involved forensic metadata experts and these were the conclusions they all drew if the files werent original the metadata would not be intact ill go with their expert opinion over yours thanks

eta this was jd v ah where the fact that metadata couldnt be verified in copied files is what hurt her on top of everything else but thats not relevant here
i think you missed the point is she able to financially bring the same as you do in the relationship is she willing to have an even financial split or is she looking for someone to take care of her what do you want do you want an equal partner or are you okay with being with someone who you need to care for
what sources are you using because while its true that often these are compromises made in relationships at your age they are by no means necessary to find a relationship so long as and especially if youre willing to wait until you find someone who feels the same way as you in fact you have a lot of the conclusions it takes people another decade or so to come to so good for you realizing this so soon

i will remind you that even with a healthy mindset relationships can fail but that doesnt mean the relationships werent worth it or didnt teach you anything so while you should properly vet women before committing to them try to loosen up on the disgust because things not working out being what you thought and all of this is a big pet of growing up and somewhere along the way its likely that exactly what you want in a partner will change and evolve as a result of these experiences and thats a good thing growth and experience isnt a bad thing just remember that regardless of what happens if you can learn something from it it was worth it
thats only if the file is original otherwise the metadata would show when the copy was created ultimately he either trusts her or he doesnt and i would understand him not being able to trust her
ive definitely had this happen if all youre referring to is the date it says when you click on the video sometimes its smart enough to know when the photovideo was actually created and other times it just is whatever the date i saved the videophoto
funny because i expect it will go exactly as she expects sex work is a hard line for a lot of people and hes conservative it doesnt take a genius to figure out more likely than not hes not going to marry someone who was a sugar baby it sucks but 1 this is why its important to choose someone who have values compatible with you and your life and 2 the sugar daddy has her number its clear that he isnt above searching her up as soon as he realizes shes married itll come out and its way better for her to get broken up with now 2 years and no commitments in rather than divorced in a few years when theres a house marriage and kids on the line 


we all make choices in life as much as i believe people can change sometimes those choices will always have consequences but its better to be with someone who accepts everything about you rather than be with someone who you know would leave you if they knew the real you like you said i knew if i told you you would have left shows just how selfish a person really is and frankly means they probably havent really changed as much as they tell themselves
if it helps tell yourself youre also going this for her she needs to be able to sort out her relationship issues without you in the picture and its clear that unfortunately youre a stressor 

and you get the added bonus of doing this for you too because no one deserves to be harassed or name called and remember this isnt your fault
okay but stop explaining it and justifying it this is what hes going to do he wants to live with his mom and he wants you at 23 years old to support his mom and him remember easier to leave a mommas boy than divorce one hes a mommas boy you arent going to change that he isnt ever going to pick you over her this is the reality instead of wasting all of your energy justifying explaining and defending what you know spend your energy figuring out what you actually want to do is this a life you want youre on reddit looking for advice so clearly some part of you is fed up i would be honest with yourself if you really think this dude is worth a lifetime of being second place you got together at 1517 ill let you in on a little secret the guys youll find now as a fully independent woman with the world at her feet will be a million times better than the guy you found when limited to your math and english lit classroom youre in the prime of your life at the ideal age to find a way better partner both on paper and in how he treats you know your worth
for both of your sake walk away now you still love her so maybe your relationship will heal but if you keep letting her in your life the friendship will sour even more than it has not only will your presence bring up some obviously repressed issues in their relationship but the chances are someone is going to say something unrecoverable neither of them is ready to deal with the fact that dude isnt straight take a step back if you love her let her sort her relationship as youre clearly putting strain on it if you love yourself take a step back because youve been groped and harassed repeatedly and you dont deserve that you do not ever need to accept someone making you feel unsafe i wish you luck i hope she realizes how shitty shes being but do not stick around as if you do youll always be the scapegoat i speak from experience walking away is the best thing for everyone involved
keep in mind and im not defending her at all she needs to come to terms with her boyfriend being predatory unfaithful and at least partially a different orientation shes probably struggling with the reality of what she just witnessed actually means and thinks its easier to blame you than deal with things 

this isnt right this isnt your fault you need to drop her because this isnt right but maybe in the future shell get her head out of her ass and apologize because every one of us including her knows that youre telling the truth and youre not making a mountain out of a molehill shes just hoping she can make a molehill out of a mountain because she doesnt want to accept her relationship is over its up to you if you ever want to entertain a friendship ever again no one blame you if you dont but its pretty clear shes heavy in denial
this is your life you only have one it is yours to do with as you please if you want to stay stay if this is who you really want to spend your life with thats a choice you can make but remember no one else should have any say in your life because at the end of the day you need to live your life no one else this guy cheated on you call a spade a spade he lied to you fucked other people manipulated you and got others around you to manipulate you too 

stop saying he technically did nothing wrong he did he knows it and you know it if he didnt do anything wrong are you telling me lying isnt wrong because he lied to you every day he told you you were the only one its foolish to keep writing things off if hes still unwilling to say i lied i knew what i was doing was wrong and i lied because i knew youd leave otherwise then theres nothing to even save
to be fair op seems to have things confused it wouldnt be her leaving if she crosses the boundary itll be him leaving it seems like hes making baseless threats and she knows it hopefully op is prepared to actually walk away otherwise hes setting himself up for a very dark future
well actually plenty of nutritionists do advocate for intermittent fasting so the idea that her skipping breakfast means she doesnt understand balanced eating is also absurd its actually a rather old take that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and now theres a much better understanding that nutrition isnt a one size fits all and what works for some might not work for others 

that being said yes they cook together and she said she monitored the calories and was still gaining weight given that she ruled out medical concerns it would lend itself to he may be doing something while you arent look unfortunately there have been a few posts of feeders who have purposefully made special condiments with huge amounts of calories to stealthily add to their partners meals not saying i really think thats whats happening here but i am saying i dont think op has all the info here
while i understand what youre saying she did minutely track her calories so she clearly does understand just how many calories are in what shes eating as nowadays people use an app where you just look up the item and amount and even while tracking she wasnt losing weight which would indicate he may have been doing something to her food while she wasnt looking
arranged marriages across continents is just plain risky i understand your faithculture but speak to a match maker or at the very least limit yourself to people you can actually meet in real life 

the nature of an arrangedaccelerated marriage like youre discussing is going to lead to people ditching you as soon as they think they may have a chance at an even slightly better prospect which realistically thats my guess what happened
thats probably unlikely to be an option he has no leverage his dad can pretty easily say marry her before you start the next year or i wont pay tuition
do so with the primary goal of you arent giving up your children and you arent allowing them to move anywhere far away i assume that especially being well off half a house and half your savings account isnt worth losing your 4 kids right because ultimately shes never getting child support if she has more money and you have your kids half the time so telling you she wont ask for child support is just emotional manipulation at that point because it wouldnt be something she would get anyway as you dont want her to have primaryfull custody
just a heads up there are a lot of people who actually stay with someone they know will be vindictive if they break up because theyre afraid in the back of their head of facing the vindictive ex and figure its easier to deal with whatever the relationship brings
yes but she specifically said she was looking forward to them cooking together more often not him cooking for her so youd generally think that that means she can see what hes doing and if shes an athlete she would understand that shit ton of butter means shit ton of calories

i totally understand most people dont understand how many calories are in fats like butter but i would expect more from someone who says she eats healthy and is an athlete of a decade
well elaborate on the conversation be blunt we met when i was getting out of a sexless marriage im afraid this is a sign our marriage is taking the same direction i hope im wrong but as my husband its both of our responsibility to discuss this as a couple if youre stressed we need to work on things together because i am not prepared to stay in a relationship where excuses run rampant and i feel tossed to the side im happy to work with you but this is something we actually need to talk about
you two werent married he didnt commit to stay through thick and thin you both committed some acts that would warrant the other ending the relationship name calling is a pretty fast relationship killer and you  said you have a pattern of namecalling now that isnt to say he was an amazing partner he also wasnt but just because you stayed in a shitty relationship doesnt mean he is under any obligation to i think people get this twisted idea of if i stay when you suck you need to stay when i suck but no putting up with bullshit doesnt buy you the ability to also act like that 

you two clearly never had a fantastic foundation for a relationship and that might be because the two of you dont mesh well or it might be because thats just how he treats the woman hes with either way as much as it hurts be thankful because this wasnt the right guy for you and its pretty obvious you werent going to end it he bit the bullet for you both and did what everyone else can see was the right call it sounds like he honestly never liked you very much and you always put up with less than you wanted because you thought you could convince him to change for you heads up if you tie your self worth into being able to convince shitty men to treat you better because youre worth it youll always be disappointed get your own therapist learn to love yourself outside of how a man treats you and then reflect on what you want in a relationship and find someone who is naturally like that as soon as you need to convince someone youre worth being treated well they arent worth your time
there are definitely other issues going on here you sound like you may have some body image issues and he may sound like hes doing something to your food i would recommend you proceed with caution because while i dont want to tell you whats going on i get a weird feeling you are missing something here both of your reactions just feel off
you probably need to just send a message saying its pretty clear you either dont want or arent ready for a relationship with me anymore so i just wanted to make sure were both on the same page this is over and i wish you the best
yeah personally id make it whenever the lease it up
oh 100 agree i said elsewhere if them growing apart wasnt enough to ruin the marriage his actions and behavior surely will
that information isnt included in the post so we cant really tell maybe there is and maybe there isnt perhaps she has other views where she believes tattoos are unclean or against her faith or she just doesnt like the look of them perhaps her ocd would manifest in another way where having a mark on her may trigger her in other ways perhaps shes afraid of needles or has a clotting disorder or a million other things that we cant know but presumably all her loved ones would know im not saying that any of this is the case but im just posing scenarios where it would be legitimate to intervene in someone making a decision fueled by mental illness that wouldnt necessarily be included in a reddit post 

all this to say sometimes if everyone with first hand knowledge of a situation including a medical professional is in agreement theres a chance that they have more informations than we do ill say this if i were going to make a permanent decision i usually wouldnt make and my loved ones knew that and knew i was going through a mental health crisis i would want them to intervene everyone else can feel differently but i would personally rather not make a permanent mistake if someone around me could stop that
usually 1 of 2 things either the person knows youre not right for them deep down but is also afraid to be alone or hurt you but once forced to be alone actually finds the one and immediately realizes theyve found what was missing all this time prompting them to take the plunge they always dragged their feet on before or sometimes you have to learn the hard way it isnt that the person loved you any less or didnt genuinely want to be with you its just that they really thought they had time they didnt really see what the big deal was and figured you agree that as long as it happens eventually its all good but as soon as theyre reminded that love isnt enough and actually women are willing to leave without that commitment as soon as they find someone they feel that same way about they dont want to lose it again so they act fast
i dont necessarily disagree but her therapist is presumably more educated than you about mental illness and ocd and advised her against getting the tattoo because she clearly felt there was ample evidence of it being fueled by the ocd to some extent if it wasnt fueled by ocd it wouldnt make a difference if she got it on her 5th 6th or any other memorable date it would really just matter that shes permanently honouring her mother

this is a classic case of commenters assuming that the poster has just as much information as they do rather than having way more information including the opinion of a medical professional specifically trained and informed of ops gfs mental health and her current state of mind
lmao what the fuck youre not immature for just wanting to get married thats absurd
you know whats even more of a special kind of stupid thinking that your boyfriend who makes the same as you and has more assets than you actually would be with you for your money its pretty obviously a joke and the fact that she cant realize she is the one with less money in the relationship so obviously he isnt with her for money just goes to show that she isnt ready for a serious relationship yet
well most notably she thinks im with her for her money and then we make the same as one another and i have more assets than she does like fam this is not a woman to start a life with you have kids you need someone stable and trustworthy not a woman looking to bail any time you make a joke a joke that anyone smart enough to be a fucking doctor should realize is a joke you literally have more money than her
you can emigrate to another country then as it seems yours doesnt really care about peoples actual happiness either that or be unhappy it seems like you get the choice of being unhappy and rich or unhappy and poor
it doesnt matter i hate people who act like someone needs to justify why they want something shes allowed to just want to be married she doesnt need to explain it no one needs to explain why they want kids or get married or have a monogamous relationship youre allowed to just want that and youre allowed to end an otherwise great relationship with someone who doesnt
i understand i hope you dont think i was implying you would cheat but understand insecurity is a hell of a thing that being said your weight is definitely not the only thing different about you you said yourself youve made a lot of big changes in the past few years its disingenuous to act like the only change is your weight not only will that many changes come with a natural shift in your personality you also said you two no longer have a big thing in common your love for games and more likely than not if youre gymming that much the way you spend your free time has also changed significantly perhaps you no longer enjoy the same foods or restaurants you once did you would almost need to or else you wouldnt have lost so much weight maybe you like to go hiking whereas before you two would watch a movie instead i get its hard for you to see how much you changed because to you youre still you but as someone who has had their partner undertake huge changes like youre describing i can promise you its way more than just your weight youre practically a new person and that can be scary for him and he also may not feel like you two are on the same page anymore 

like i said in a previous comment just because you think everything is fine and you dont care about how different you two are now doesnt mean he doesnt care and based on everything youre saying its clear he cares
time to put on your big girl pants and say the scary thing i know you havent given it much thought but after 4 years you need to start im not willing to wait as long as youre saying you want before marriage is even on the table to discuss you need to think long and hard now about if you want to marry me because the option isnt going to be on the table forever and its not even going to be on the table for another year im sorry to put you in a difficult spot but this is a dealbreaker for me if four years isnt enough time for you to be sure then no amount of time will be and im not willing to wait any longer to find that out i love you and i want us to be together but i love me more i know what i want in life and i wont be a girlfriend for a decade its just not something i have any interest in
the thing is you dont need to know the details of their relationship not everyone wants to be a girlfriend for 67 years its the same thing as one person wanting kids and another not even if the rest of the relationship is everything you ever hoped youd find this is a deal breaker

and thats before factoring in theres no way to know if he really will ever marry her or is just kicking the can down the road like so many men do and why so many women are not willing to be a girlfriend for 67 years
yeah i mean i think its easy for us to sit from our chair and tell op to leave but i agree if she wants to feel like she gave him a chance she needs to be brutally honest with him too that timeline doesnt work for me if you dont see yourself getting engaged or married for a few years we need to part ways i want a relationship that is working towards marriage and if after 4 years that isnt a step youre willing to take with me yet im not willing to wait until you are you need to think about if this is really how you feel because if so we need to be having a very different conversation
i honestly think everyone acting like he took advantage of her is making too big of an assumption more likely than not he got someone who he felt comfortable with and now is afraid that shes gotten hot and successful and will want to upgrade her partner its pretty common from both men and women and isnt as malicious or intentional as people think its just that some people arent able to handle jealousy and insecurity and purposefully choose a partner that doesnt flare that insecurity and arent prepared for such a huge shake up 

that combined with i stayed by my partner when they were fatpoorno bodyetc and then they became hotrichfamous etc and the first thing they did was leave me for someone they met at the gymworkwherever is way more common than people want to admit do i think thats op no not at all but its silly to pretend that exactly what this guy is afraid of isnt something that happens all the time it happens so often that its a running troupe of people in professions like doctors lawyers tech and professional sports
i think you are being naive yes because the reality is hes making these comments because youve already grown apart for you maybe you dont care but for him it seems he cares he wants a woman who shares the same hobbies with him who is lower maintenance and doesnt care about how she looks or making a ton of money im not saying this to criticize you strong independent women are amazing and we need more of them in this world but not everyone wants a gym rat girl boss tm some people want a cozy gamer and that isnt you anymore and thats okay but its naive to act like if you think its fine so does he and clearly he doesnt think its fine he clearly feels like hes already lost the woman he fell in love with do not change for him please you should always be who you feel most comfortable being but you also may need to come to terms with the fact that youve begun to walk different paths that no longer cross
maybe dont focus too much on him wanting someone to control because that might not really be true more likely he thought had a sweet chubby introverted gamer girl he wasnt worried about losing and now youre independent making more money than him youve gotten hot and probably have more male attention from dudes who never wouldve looked at you before and lets be real youve become an entirely different person than you were when you met he likely feels like he cant compete with the sort of guys you can get now 

how hes handling it isnt cool and its controlling but its also probably coming from a place of fear and desperationpanic that hes about to lose you the sad thing is if the fact that you two are now completely different people wasnt going to ruin your relationship how hes acting now certainly will its a selffulfilling prophecy but also the reality is you grew up and he didnt and thats okay but you two dont seem to be compatible anymore
honestly i thought it was him making fun of how everyone in the sub jumps to insane conclusions boy was i wrong
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman forgive yourself but also recognize you cant keep pretending this marriage is functional it isnt now and it wasnt before end it and set yourself free
if it makes you feel better it wasnt you who selfsabotaged your marriage its pretty clear that something was very wrong in your marriage long before you ever said that as a happily married and monogamous man doesnt voraciously message everyone he knows looking for a hookup the second his wife indicates she might be okay with it a respectful husband doesnt ignore his wife communicating she isnt okay with it there were issues in your marriage that perhaps you were aware of or more likely werent prepared to actually face but the marriage was over a long time before you ever brought up another woman
lmao of course were not 100 accurate but you said it yourself he was jerking you around why do you suddenly think thats going to change 

ive read your other comments youre either looking for a fight because youre upset this dude is ghosting or youre a troll because you havent responded to a single comment genuinely looking for an objective viewpoint youre just trying to argue which just makes me think if youre actually a real person really going through this dude has probably realized 10 year younger tang isnt worth crazy if youre a real person just recognize how batshit you must come off in real life if after 4 comments on the internet pretty much any man on here would be running from you good luck i do hope youre a troll because otherwise youre in for a very sad life if you dont grow up and fast
yeah you dont respect yourself why wouldnt he beg you to move in you demand nothing of him let him do whatever he wants never ask for more and here you are left alone at home while he goes and hangs out with the family who degrades you that he apparently doesnt even care enough about you to talk about you in front of them and you still want to plan elaborate and thoughtful birthday celebrations and get him a cake it makes total sense why a person like him would drool over finding a woman who cant even demand she be a part of his birthday celebration you think he would actually want a woman who calls him out on his shit of course not

be honest with yourself how much more do you let him get away with
elaborate what you mean and what you got mad about 

overall he may not have been ignoring you then but you also probably never said im done either so it may be a bit different this time
he read it because leaving someone on read sends a pretty clear message of i saw what you said i want you to know that i saw what you said and i want you to know that i am intentionally choosing not to reply to you 

in short he isnt interested why did you get mad at him perhaps you were right and this guy isnt right for you so all in all its probably a win for you both im the future just be a bit more careful when you tell someone youre done if you arent prepared to mean it its probably not a great idea to say it rarely do people play well into that sort of hot and cold
maybe youve learned some valuable lessons dont start things with roommates and if this is a trend maybe youre moving too fast in your relationships and progressing too intensely with the wrong sort of guy youll heal but itll take time dont worry about breaking down youre human and thats a beautiful thing you arent meant to be a robot
well just remember there is no waiting it out nothing will ever change until you do if youd realized this 45 years ago you couldve been married and successful by now but dont fret the second best time to make a change is now and thankfully you still have time for that

stop being complacent in your own life you have a choice here dont forget you do have power in your own life you arent helpless
but remember that is a choice you are actively making you can just as easily and quickly stop being a doormat as much as you dont want to say anything because youre scared and itll hurt or whatever other bullshit you keep telling yourself if you really asked yourself are you not already alone in your own marriage are you not causing yourself pain every day knowing your wife wants another mans affection wondering ifwhen shell cheat on you too

people often overlook the chronic pain they invite upon themselves because they think an acute pain will be worse but trust me it isnt id rather have a broken arm that will heal than deal with lupus every day until i die
good youve spent the past decade gaslighting yourself into ignoring or brushing off hundreds of red flags second guess everything and see your life and your marriage for what it really is not what you want it to be that way you can start to see just how much better you deserve and how much better you can get stop allowing yourself to be the backup
i mean really the only think you can be sure of is youre being a doormat and of course your wife isnt going to respect you you dont even respect yourself youre worth more than this man you have to know that
how can you lose something you never actually had

she never actually picked you she just did enough to fool you into thinking she had i dont even see my actual friends from college as much as you seem to have this guy in your lives thats a bit weird dont you think
heres to hoping he just doesnt care as much as some do care the vast majority really dont enjoy your newfound freedom
well because its decently obvious by the lets just figure things out as housemates rather than as a couple that he sees it as a relationshipbreaker because shes basically said as much how else would you take that comment
that is not what the joke implies not even close
im going to be honest everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions esh because at the end of the day who youre friends with also reflects on you and its pretty abysmal that even after all this you werent the one to pull the plug here on the friendship she was 

having fun and partying is great and all but its practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in manhattan during a huge holiday if this is commonplace for you or your friends and based on your tone it appears to be you need to really selfreflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old
no i just dont feel the need to engage with victim blamers
lmao so if you think the wife is abusive its cool to just blame the victim the father of her abuse got it yeah bye now
id probably only ever see yelling as appropriate if someone is in actual danger or about to do something really destructive and you need to get their attention now i can also see people yelling at one another if extremely angryfed up about a lot of issues in their relationship that theyre just at the end of their rope for but in that example id probably say that either the person yelling has issues themselves or the person yelling is only doing so because they dont love themselves enough to walk away and instead think yelling will get through to an otherwise toxic partner 


ill go out on a limb and say your partner has anger issues though but regardless of if you or he is the problem and its him it isnt you this isnt a healthy relationship
fiance thankfully she wont need to worry about a divorce all she needs to do is separate finances and figure things out like housemates instead of a couple which conveniently is exactly what shes doing and im sure we can all guess exactly why
i think the point is unless you think he should be abusive he ultimately isnt in a position to allow his wife to do anything his wife is going to do what his wife is going to do shes her own person just like op is his own person and he cant force him to return home or forgive his sister see the issue youre acting as though the father can just snap his fingers and force everyone to fall in line to his will but thats not how people work his wife and the other kids are all independent people capable of their own decisions and actions theyll act as they see fit and its up to the people around them to react how they see fit the only very loose way to not allow his wife to treat op that way would be by saying if she keeps it up hes divorcing her 

and now were back to the beginning sentiment its unfair and unrealistic to expect this man to throw away his marriage and his relationship with his two other kids who actually live close to him to support ops beliefs who not only isnt cutting off his father but also lives across the country anyway
idk if i were you id probably just say i know why you beat up  thank you but please dont do it again i dont want assholes like that to ever take anything else from me again and then just give him a big hug
hey i agree fully im just saying when it comes to the father i understand why he isnt taking such a hard and fast approach now i think cheaters and wrong and i think the mom isnt handling things well at all but those two things are a bit unrelated
his mom told him that not his father i agree the mom sucks for how shes acting im just saying it makes sense that the dude isnt going to ruin his marriage and relationship with all his other kids when 1 op isnt cutting him off and 2 op is across the country everyone else is right there real life is more complicated than reddit acts
you should be able to get someone to do it for 5001k at most
where do you see the dad putting himself in the middle by doing anything other than existing again this is his daughter its ridiculous to expect him to throw away his marriage and his relationship with all of his other kids because you think that its not completely normal for parents to be way more forgiving than you would be to their own childs mistakes 

i repeat the world is not as black and white as you seem to think it is and we do not have all the information here to know any of the details of why everyone feels how they feel on this matter
she insinuated she does want kids so not sure why either of those should factor in if she wants kids its better to be with someone with a child than someone with undiagnosed and seemingly severe mental illness
eh i dont really think its fair to expect people to entirely blow up their marriage and their relationship with the rest of their kids to support the beliefs of someone else yeah i think cheaters suck but thats also his daughter it makes sense that even when your kid messes up you arent going to immediately exile them the world isnt as black and white as reddit acts like it is
it really isnt ive found partners at many ages you probably just arent looking in an effective place
instead of relying on apps join classes or workout groups with interests you have so you meet someone naturally
i mean its not actually that hard youre just being defeatist because it scares you to be alone for a year or so but thats perfectly normal be you 25 35 or 45 it takes time to find a good partner
honestly the mom of whoever called overstepped id get it if a day had passed but thats really overkill for an adult woman a few hours with no contact
just be prepared for your dad to turn the invite down hes right youre putting him in a nowin situation and more likely than not hes going to avoid pissing off his wife and kids that live close to him youre far away its way less hassle to turn you down than pick a fight with everyone near by i just want to prepare you for the most likely outcome
you should probably speak to a lawyer familiar with this you should start by getting a survey of your land so you know exactly what is yours and what isnt get up property line markers it shouldnt cost more than 1k for the surveyor and marking everything out with physical markers youre going to need a lawyer to know how to best indicate anyone past this point is officially trespassing because like everyone said youre taking on a huge liability and also putting yourself in a position where your land could be seized by the local government as youve allowed public access i know youre very pregnant but this needs to take priority because the last thing you want is to be recovering from birth and trying to figure out how to be a mom and then youre getting sued because someone on an atv died hitting a low hanging branch and the parents blame you for not trimming the trees or a million other examples that have actually happened and the property owners were held liable for your husband can hopefully take on some of the burden of sorting this as it will likely be a good amount of logistical sorting but itll be cheaper in the long run especially if this is meant to be your forever home put up signs at the entry points for now take photos and get a lawyer asap
im just going to pop in here to remind everyone that a person with ppp has an approximately 45 chance of either committing infanticide or suicide yes there is an elevated risk and yes these women absolutely need professional help do not treat women with this condition as ticking time bombs though
you were in a previously abusive relationship so you think as long as he isnt abusive hes great but thats not true you may need some therapy to reset what you should want in a man because this isnt it 

not abusive isnt even the bare minimum of being a half decent guy and it seems like thats really all you have as your standard right now understandable but love yourself more than that aim higher stop going for dudes with no ambition
hey women can have big feet too
because if youre in an accident where enough forcefriction is generated to pull off your shoes its just statistically more likely that that same force was lethal
if you dont leave just tell him you need to be more careful if this happens again im breaking up with you immediately i do not give a shit if its an accident or not if youre so incapable of controlling your dckk you cant keep it from sodomizing me i have 0 interest continuing our relationship am i crystal clear

and if it happens again then you leave
all that matters is it makes you feel good
i dont think dresses like this look good on anyone personally its too shapeless and is reminiscent of a trash bag to me but fashion should always be more about how you feel than what others think imo
youre never an ah for fighting for your kids never the sooner you learn that the better a father youll be
just for some actual facts as worms arent something parents tend to discuss at daycare 2030 of preschoolprimary school aged children will have a threadworm infection so definitely common enough that it isnt a surefire sign of neglect but not so common that the parents shouldnt be taking steps to prevent
because its not him forbidding her access to basic hygiene its just nature of being a parent to a newborn youd have to make the argument an infant is the abusive one as thats who is technically preventing the sil from showering regularly which is entirely ridiculous as a concept until you actually have a kid you clearly are ignorant to the fact that even two present and active parents will often not have time to shower for 2 days it isnt the husband directly saying i forbid you from showering which yeah is abusive its i have a newborn and my husband isnt being a present dad and i dont want to leave my kid alone or take him in the shower with me theyre fundamentally different im not going to argue with someone who has clearly never had a newborn or had the lowest maintenance newborn ever to know that its just plain normal and expected that when you have a newborn you just plain arent going to shower every day hell i dont have a newborn and im so busy with normal adulting tasks that i have often gone 2 days without a shower no one is abusing me its just ridiculous to conflate i dont have time to do x with someone is forcing me not to do x so yeah even by your definition this is not abuse 

i am not going to argue about this further because its clear you dont understand how common it is to be too busy to shower every day when you have a newborn its not a sign of abuse its just a sign of being a parent
you probably need to stop considering him your husband he said pretty clearly he no longer views you as a wife youre just the woman who gave birth to his kid you need to understand you have absolutely no leverage here and your husband hasnt divorced you yet simply because it would put his daughter through more trauma than she needs right now but you arent an equal partner youre on probation and if you dont start acting like it dont be surprised if he realizes youre trying to traumatize your daughter more by forcing her to be a puppet than he will traumatize her by putting her through a messy custody battle
op nicely but understand what your husband is really saying hes saying this if you ever want to see your daughter youre going to do everything exactly on my terms otherwise i will go through a court battle to completely strip you of the right to see your daughter i dont want to but if you force me to i will  know youre place and right now your place is egg donor not mother you need to earn the right to call yourself her mom
sure but none of that is abuse thats just not meeting your needs as a partner that isnt abuse again thats being a bad partner the two are very different and a lot of people conflate the two bad partner yes bad dad probably abusive nothing here indicates that
he was working regardless of the rest it isnt abusive to tell your partner to take a screaming infant and guest out of the room youre working in look i agree hes a crappy fatherpartner but the bottom line is nothing here is actually abuse its just being a shitty partner 

he isnt keeping her unwashed or sleep deprived being a new borderline single mom is whats keeping her unwashed and sleep deprived and for those who dont understand how parenthood works even two fully attentive parents will likely end up unwashed and sleep deprived in the first year of parenthood its just what happens its not abuse its not neglect its what you sign up for when you have a kid yeah shes doing more than she should but thats different from abuse
neglecting the child yes neglecting the needs of your partner especially while youre working like the guy was in this story no youre just a poor partner at worst believe it or not shes a fully grown adult and capable of taking care of herself and isnt fully reliant on a man like an infant may be for care abuse is definitely the wrong word here with the information presented please stop pushing for such a strong word to be watered down that only hurts actual abuse victims in the long run again not all bad partners are abusive partners hes a bad partner no info indicating hes an abusive one
did i miss anything actually funny happening looks like he just walked by them carefully
shes 23 shes dating a 37 year old how reliable do you really think either of them are going to be at caring for 2 young kids shes going to be stuck in the hotel room earning her free vacation there isnt much other reason 37 year olds date 23 year olds and they certainly dont do it because said 23 year old is practically a mom whatever the fuck that means
no it isnt weird at all have you ever had a newborn sometimes youre so desperate for adult interaction youll hold up the mailman thats not a sign of abuse thats a sign of parenthood especially parenthood with a rather absent partner
at the end of the day that was his decision not to actually pursue any means of getting the money back if heyour step sis were unwilling to even try to get the money back from the actual person who stole it theyve pretty much lost the right to even ask anyone else to provide it
i think jumping to clearly an abuser because hes a bad partner is a stretch hes a bad partner and bad father for sure but this is another example of bad person  abusive person
hey also depends on the kind of partner youre trying to attract too
hopefully this has revealed to you a truth about your husband youll stop ignoring as based on your previous comments this behaviorside of him is nothing new what example are you setting for your son by tolerating this behavior
you probably need to think about the grander scheme of your marriage when you find a place to stay because this doesnt sound like a good place for you at all
understood is in quotes so op clearly doesnt actually feel like he understands you can say you understand and still not actually take the action required to back that up the likely fact is in order to change the agreement his dad may need to go to court and his mom may not let him go so easily if his dad isnt willing to deal with thatsimply isnt willing to be ops full time guardian understanding or not op is 14 years old and really doesnt have much of a choice on where he lives

which sucks but hes 14 he cant just move out
is that actually an option though ops father called him selfish so perhaps he wont let him move in full time not only that it may require a custody battle for that to actually happen if the mom wanted to put up a fight about it
if you do consider her a friend id send in a text message so you have this in writing if she goes off the deep end something you the effect of hey name im sorry i made you feel worse in an already tough time for you im happy to help you out but i need to be clear about a few things i have no interest in you romantically or sexually i consider you a friend and nothing more i want to be really clear that you dont have to worry about my having any ulterior motives because that simply isnt how i see you and im not comfortable with you implying otherwise while youre living at my place that being said while im happy to give you a place to crash while you get back on your feet i am also not comfortable fully supporting you youll need to take care of food and anything else you need on your own if you havent been paid in 5 weeks thats illegal and you need to talk your boss or file a complaint but im sure im not the only person in your support network so if you need to youll need to lean on more than just me ive been busy lately so im going to continue taking advantage of part of my compensation at work since the food is better than anything i can cook but youre more than welcome to stock the fridge with whatever you want and i wont take any of it if you feel uncomfortable staying with me for whatever reason please dont feel obligated and be upset if you want to stay with someone else but if you do plan to stay moving forward we need to be clear on boundaries i dont want any implications im trying to get with you and you need to start providing the basics for yourself im only here to give you a place to stay nothing more
fam stop resenting him and start resenting yourself because youre the problem here you ten respecting yourself at all this man has no loyalty to you stop spending time on someone who has told you he isnt loyal
im pretty sure he meant you dont get paid every day not that you dont get paid when the company tells you
hey ultimately that might be what ends up happening but i think people sometimes underestimate how difficult it is to connect with that one person who fits all the criteria especially as a 32 year old new father if he doesnt even have time to hang out with existing friends alone its pretty unlikely he will have time to find and vet random people who are okay with hanging out with a baby especially because unfortunately there is a higher chance of someone any gender biting at the gambit to hang out with a man with an infant potentially being not suitable to have around said infant 

we like to say that you should wait around and not take shit and only surround yourselves with the people who are perfectly suited for you but if thats your attitude you also need to be prepared to simply end up alone which when youre a new dad newly in your 30s which is definitely a shock for plenty of people myself included it sucked no longer being in your 20s and old and lost touch with a lot of old friends being alone can be really isolating and isnt actually as healthy advice as you think 

tldr yes the advice of find friends who are okay with being a dad is great but it fails to consider just how hard that process often is when youre a brand new dad
i am assuming 500 is a lot less than a hotel wouldve cost for the time you stayed 

in light of that id probably say something to the effect of the full day sounds awesome i am really sorry but right now i only have enough room in our savings for the half day thats my fault for not specifying im hoping we get a second income source within the next few months or else were really going to need to figure out some different moves and if youre willing to wait for our thanks until we have a steady income id be happy to set up the full day but otherwise if you do want the full day and are willing to pay the difference i can send over a gift card for the amount and let you decide if you would like to upgrade just let me know im really thankful you let us stay with you and want to make sure you know how grateful i am
a completely normal and healthy one lmao believe it or not its an extremely unhealthy mentality to have that close family should leave each other high and dry for what amounts to no really good reason reddit is actually pretty toxic in the other direction with family owes you nothing and expect to do everything 100 on your own or else youre a toxic failure we have family for a reason and quite frankly its an extremely eurocentric view that many cultures would have a serious issue with family helps family family shows up for family and honestly outside of redditextenuating circumstances if your family cant rely on you to follow through that says more about you than your family 

again if this were an issue shouldve been raised when he was asked to be the best man the brother is going to be close enough where if anything happens hell just be able to leave its a local wedding he leaves them alone for work he can leave them alone to be the best man he agreed to
yeah you generally speaking do get to expect your brother who agreed to be your best man at your child free wedding follows through he absolutely can decide not to but the brother is the asshole not op its fine to not expect family to bend over backwards and set themselves on fire to keep you warm but reddit has gone way too far in the opposite direction family does owe family some grace especially if no abuse or other factors are at play these are normal siblings the brother would 10000 be an asshole for dropping out because he cant be away from his wife and kid for half a day especially when he agreed knowing it was a child free wedding and likely knowing the intimate details of why its childfree
most og influencers actually worked as well you can be serious about something and still understand you also cant leech off other people i mean hell johnny depp only became an actor because he wanted to finance his music career
hes ops best man presumably he was aware of the no child wedding for a long time he would absolutely be an ah to back out of a commitment made understanding the rules of the commitment just because hes being held to those rules not only would he be an ah to op hes also be being an ah to his kid as our society is by and large moving away from tolerating overgrown toddlers and mommas boys
correct but as i said look at things from kates perspective how would she know that jamie wanted op there so he could propose she couldnt all she saw was jamie begging for op to attend his birthday party and with all the other info she had thats definitely going to breed insecurity in most people jealousy is a human emotion and as much as it would be nice to tell her to get over it i see why she felt the way she did
i mean not really look at literally every female celebrity ever they were hot before and theyre hot now honestly id argue most looked better without the surgery its definitely not accurate to say hotter more likely its just different its all about self perception sometimes 

and yeah but also if she looked how she did but was a horrid person she wouldnt be with him either so it isnt just looks attraction is important but its not everything im sure she knows that its different if she thought thats the only reason her husband is with her of course
before you dig yourself into too deep of a hole she said shes struggled with this even as a teen meaning the surgery isnt what made her the hot one she always was she just had surgery to make herself feel better about how she looked but clearly shes always been beautiful to everyone around her even without the surgery and that friends is body dysmorphia in a nutshell
it probably doesnt help that jamie and op do have so much more than just him finding her attractive theyre really good friends to the point where he was begging op to rearrange her schedule to be at the party im not saying hes in love with her at all but from the perspective of kate i understand where the insecurities lie you cant just write it off as physical attraction in the moment and nothing more they have an emotional bond as well now i know well enough that you can be friends with someone and not want to marry them but putting yourself in kates shoes it can be hard to say that confidently i feel for op though it sucks to lose friends for something you cant control
fair enough you date enough people unfortunately youll encounter plenty of toxic ones definitely do not make this right though she either needs to come to her senses which i suspect she will at some point especially if you dont chase after her or she wont in which case you can decide if thats really the sort of trait you want in a partner good luck you did nothing wrong though btw never lend money you arent willing to lose
nah 24 is definitely an age where its fair to expect a person be mature and responsibly by shes been out of college for 23 years at this point she isnt a freshman in college thats definitely not normal behavior even for a 24 year old
that isnt really true plenty of people are willing to bail their partners out now are they obligated to no but dont imply that asking your partner for any financial help automatically is unhealthy
yeah and a reminder of your friends should understand if you cant contribute 1k dinners youre an awesome person and a true friend will be happy to have your company and whatever it is you can contribute thats in your budget i had a lot of friends way wealthier than me at that age there was never an expectation i had to keep up
well dresses makeup the bachelorette party spa day theres lots of things you could contribute that would be around that much
tbf if you have a pattern of ending up with immature women its possible that regardless of the age youre being attracted by traits that go hand in hand with this sort of immaturity
i am pretty sure a lot of 24 year olds are significantly more mature than this especially ones who have educationsjobs and friends are getting married
 why would he offer to pay for a night out he wasnt even at i get we freak at age gaps but 24 and 32 are both adults that are at approximately the same life stage this isnt about age as much about 1 dont lend money youre not willing to lose and 2 always check your bank account
so i want to address both sides of this the first is your friend lied to you and thats definitely problematic i dont really think testing people is ever a great tactic that said hes a friend not a lover and you dont necessarily need to be able to have the same level of trust in a friend as you would your wife so if you decide to keep being friends with him after this simply make sure you do so with caution and a modicum of distance put between you two on anything of importance i understand that may be controversial but 1 its difficult to make friends once youre older and have a family and 2 if all of us are honest we have or at least have had plenty of friends that were good to go to lunch or a concert with but you would never call if you needed a place to stay or something huge 

now onto his side of things hes a 29 year old male yes there are some dudes who will be fine going on a stroller walk but the reality is most guys arent hell id probably guess most dudes with kids wouldnt even want to do that as a hang out theyre going to want to have fun go to a bar watch a game play pool or whatever that activity is im not saying its going to involve drugs or blacking out but you probably also need to understand that in order to maintain friendships you need to retain your identity as okstill179 first and loving father second a lot of women also struggle with this balance so dont be alarmed or feel weird about it make sure youre taking time to go and just be you with your friends and make sure youre not making you and your infant a package deal most single 20s guys just arent going to want a kid involved and i definitely empathize it may mean its a few months till you and your wife find that balance so just ask for some patience but remember that the balance is important to find especially if realistically you want to be able to maintain friendships
she said she sold it at a profit but so its an investment are you telling me you should sell your stocks at what you paid for it even if theyre worth double thats just stupid
that is what happens when youre the waitress at a table you come back multiple times
ok if thats what you mean then i understand that thats fair to expect once ownership has changed hands
youre aware that you only deem op an ah because you want the brother to be able to continue to take advantage right because an eviction wouldve been inevitable unless you think he shouldve been allowed to take advantage as nauseam and at that point the difference between op serving him with an eviction and the new owner is its way harder to pressure a stranger than family so why do you really think the eviction is an ah move

genuinely asking btw because i get what people are saying but i dont think they realize what that really would mean
fair enough but no and i think a lot of people are really not understanding its extremely common that rented apartments dont have top of the line run your shower max temp for hours at a time water heaters that would be required for 56 people to get hot showers i mean hell my old apartment i alone couldnt take a shower longer than 15 minutes without getting cold water thats just usually how it is when you rent you dont get unlimited hot water you have to plan your showers you deal with it
a quick common sense search also tells you 3 is a lot less than 612
its very obvious you think renting a home is the same as owning and it simply is not when you finally do own a home maybe youll understand until then dont comment on what you clearly dont understand
thats simply not true if that were actually true developers builders property managers etc would never go bankrupt but they 100 do that would mean these people never get sued never had to evict anyone never have any damages ot gone a month without rent theres absolutely a risk just because someone is typically smart enough not to overextend themselves to the point where they cant float the additional costs does not mean there is no risk it just shows your ignorance on the costs involved in running a business and owning a home to think there isnt if there was no risk everyone would be a landlord but they arent why because theres risk
