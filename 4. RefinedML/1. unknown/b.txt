e
and thats your fault how exactly 
pretty sure he deals with this idk every year does he become unbearable to everyone or just you

anyway nta

so now youre already weak and cant drive im going to assume tomorrow wont be any better because you dont have the meds you need to keep you stronger so is he gonna get them tomorrow or do you just wait for winter when it cools down a bit 

hes not really a good partner if these meds are a life long thing how can you trust hell take care of you in the future or if your condition gets worse
i was thinking you were talking about booking thru dvc because you referenced the 11 month mark which is when as a dvc you can start booking 

if you werent then disregard most everything i wrote because it will not apply 

i havent made a cash stay at disney but if the booking window only opens at the 11 mo mark then the advice to be ready at exactly that day and even as close to the hour as possible would still apply 

sorry if i confused you
im a little confused 

they want to figure out why so many others of their own party  but really its jan 6 ppl and trump are being investigated as opposed to what 
just sweeping it under the rug and not investigating or are they saying these are not legitimate investigations and are more being done based on party politics 

if you break the law you get investigated and probably usually maybe charged 

im getting a little sick of congress investigating anything they investigate while ongoing investigations are being done by other law enforcement agencies its just redundantif i was an innocent witness id be overwhelmed being grilled by le and congress
as long as you have enough home points at either or both resorts you should absolutely be ready to book at the exact hour at the 11 mo mark 

check to make sure but im pretty sure you cant combine your poly and wl points to use at either resort at 11 mo youd have to use for instance your poly points at poly at 11 mo and then add to the res using your wl points at the 7 mo mark because one of them isnt your home resort at the other resort i hope that makes sense 

keep in mind if youre looking around at 2023 summer availability to get an idea of how it is its already past the 11 mo and close to the 7 mo mark so you wont get an adequate comparison 

if youre looking at 11 mo out availability just to see what it looks like in 2023 its not a good comparison because its a diff month and season if im doing it right that puts you in late nov early dec which is prime time
what change exactly are they fighting for 

do they think just because they are an interracial couple they can eradicate racism by what just being a couple  
if it was that easy it would have been gone decades ago 

exactly what injustice has been done to them megan got some bad press well welcome to the world of a public figure it happens to any and everyone who has a public profile 

these two think that just because they want  to be seen as doing no wrong no one is allowed to call them out when they do wrong 

anybody else just getting bored of the whole thing i come here to keep up but its just a never ending circle jerk 
and if no one reported on them theyd just do something even more outrageous to be back in the news and start the whole cycle over again 

 yes i realize how that sounds as im commenting on them but its just all so absurd 
these two are so dramatic 

any visit they would have in the uk for any royal engagement theyd take a private plane  cause they could never fly commercial and be driven to whatever royal house theyd be staying at their security guard they already employ could travel with them 
once there they have regular security  for the house compound grounds etc thats already in place anyway 
then when they have to get to the engagement theyd be traveling with all of the rest of the family that would have security 

there is literally no way anyone could get to them not that anyones coming 

they really think theyre all that huh
ywnbta

its time you sit your mom down and lay out some facts that she either gets on board with or she doesnt come 

these people have done nothing wrong and have actually been good to you i think its great that you can have at least some of her dads fam in her life 

tell your mom that going forward its joint everything and that includes your fil  she doesnt have to like everyone that you choose to be friends with but she sure has to respect your relationships with them 
her crying over this stuff is so over the top its childish the longer you allow it to go on the worse it will get
7 months on and off  this is not a relationship thats going well no 

cut your losses now shes gonna find something else to fly off the handle for and youll be equally as baffled as this time 

and her following you is odd she was probably worried you were snooping in her room because you were taking longer than usual because of the spill which then also explains why she sent you out and she stayed behind to make sure everything was in its place 
do you want someone who doesnt trust you
why are we even discussing kc paying her off  
he owes her nothing not even ransom to get his son back 

if h suddenly decides he needs out then he can go thru the divorce court on his own and they can fight it out
so basically h just refuses to listen to any criticism of anything his bro and dad say about m megxit and bullying 
but when the bro and dad refuse to listen to his counter argument theyre in the wrong 

he just refuses to believe that she can be anything but an angel and thats why hes in the position hes in 

the 25 page bullying rebuttal is probably filled with excuses shes american she didnt know thats not how she does things shes direct not rude etc 

but it doesnt matter she joined a family that has rules regulations and a way things are done you cant come in and expect them to change for you and thats what they wanted they wanted to modernizean institution that doesnt need modernizing because to the witch that means making the brf a money making merchandiser 

and once again this is why the fam doesnt want to talk to him because there is nothing private
im gonna be brutally honest with you

you willingly got into a relationship with a man who cheats and leaves every relationship hes ever had and to placate him you decide to have an open relationship which really in this situation is just you agreeing to let him cheat 

how exactly did you think this was not going to end any other way than with him leaving you 

did you think as long as he was having sex with other women he would always come back to you 
why would you want a life of sharing the person you love with multiple others 

and the worst part  you brought your then 9 year old  at the time who grew up in this situation along for the ride 
think about what youve been modeling to your d 
do you want her to hitch herself to men who cheat and leave 
or do you want to model a monogamous loving relationship which is what you should be striving for 

you know what you have to do find some self respect and leave his sorry ass stand up for yourself and show your d now while shes just starting to figure out relationships what she should and shouldnt be accepting from a partner
whats wrong with his health 
i havent heard of anything
everyone already thinks andrew is  scum so writing unflattering stories of andrew insulting or upsetting either one of them isnt going to elicit any sympathy for hm 

or andrew knows way too much about her past antics 

or hes not high enough on the pecking order knocking him down a peg or two isnt gonna elevate h to king 

or he needs to stay in beatrices good graces to get the inside scoop 

or most probable andrew just doesnt care enough to have any dealings with the lunatic fringe of the family he saw the train wreck coming and noped out
seriously tho where did he get the hair 
did he cut it off her head in the coffin
did she give it to him after a haircut

and why would he even want it 
did he need it to make a witches potion 

im so baffled by this hair in a box
yta a massive massive one 

there is no excuse for a 7 yo to smear lipstick all over anything 
your d showed great restraint in only yelling at the little brat 

the one who should be punished is layla she has been told repeatedly to leave your ds stuff alone and she keeps repeating the offense with no consequence 

you cannot expect your d to lock up everything she owns every single day and night in her own room that you moved her ss into because you wanted to marry her mother stop bending over backward to placate your wife and her kids thats ridiculous 

what is wrong with you how did you ever parent your own kids since it seems youre clueless 

give your d back her phone buy her a new dress and punish the 7 year old 

stop making your 16 yo teach the 7 yo what her mother should be teaching her 
oh and of course your wife thinks the punishment is fine her little angel of a
d should never be made to cry  


be a better parent to your d
come on man you went to the best schools from the age of 3 are we to believe that you never ever had a lesson on hitler and the nazis  

does he really expect us to believe that he had absolutely zero idea that costume was not just offensive but its one of those absolutely do not do things 

the fam def paid way too much for his education
at this point the longest or shortest  idc serving independent 

enough with d and r 

it stops the circus thats happening now
i think willy and harold are honestly just snarky nicknames that had for each other as kids 

i could see harry calling him willy as in dick and w calling him harold because its like an old man name  
theyre were just making fun of each other as kids
nta
i agree it wasnt your secret to tell 

your wife is now realizing that her idea of honesty is telling everyone everything and that now that she sees the flip side of it she will change her ways this is a good thing 

she should let your d know that she realizes why d wouldnt tell her and that now that she sees the repercussions of her flawed strategy she will respect whatever d chooses to share with her 

this could turn out to be a good thing
nono you got it all wrong 

megsie was the one wronged by all members of the family the media her ex husband her ex bfs her dad her siblings in all things ever   
they all caused the strife that was blamed on her  

and shell keep saying it until we all agree with her   
good point youre right they probably laid it all out for him
and leaving out the details is what makes him look like a whining child 

im sure c had a legit reason for not wanting m there and even if its that he wanted just immediate family 

h cant say what that reason he was given because it would make him look bad to argue about it so he leaves it out thinking it will make c look like the bad guy but of course that would never happen because c can dictate whatever the hell he wants in regards to his mothers death
whats meant by this

its not hard to see why prince harry and meghan markle decided to leave england amid all this drama and tension and we havent even gotten into harry and williams physical fightwhich you can read about in detail below

the drama and tension was started by harry and megan with their over entitlement with their feelings of superiority their jealousy of every other working royal 
dont want drama and tension dont start it
you need to keep working on your jealousy issues or they will come into play and ruin every other relationship you will have in the future 

take your jealousy issue as the lesson you learned from this relationship and use that thought as motivation to move on and be thankful that this happened at a young age instead of having a string of failed relationships 

in the future i would advise that you not spend all your time with a partner its not healthy for anyone 
its not sustainable in the long run 

its not that you cant move in because youre so stuck on this o e girl its that you have no idea what to do with the time you normally spent with her 
find a hobby read a book do a puzzle anything so you dont just sit like a lump on a log and pine away for someone that doesnt want to be with you
after the book if theres more vague crap the palace can legitimately make a statement saying something to the affect that  

even though the k will always have a fathers love for a son its become quite obvious that h  m are doing their level best to distance themselves from the family for the celebration of the coronation the k has decided that he will adhere to their want of distance 

idk something diplomatic without coming out and saying no one wants them here 

no one is ever going to think it has anything to do with race that horse is dead beaten dug up beat some more and reburied
most telling to me is this passage 

harry then accused his brother of acting like an heir unable to understand why his younger brother was not content to be a spare

this is the crux of h he admits it 

all of his moaning and it all comes down to the fact that he isnt going to be king 

too bad so sad 30 years and he still hasnt come to terms with it
i think being a global icon is her goal 

she thought she hit the jackpot when she bagged the dimwit she really thought that overnight her name would be recognizable to everyone and every possible door to fame and fortune would be opened for her 

so basically she thought shed be an icon for basically getting married 

in reality shes half of a couple with a victim complex who people are sick of hearing from and about
i think an invictus show would have been interesting to watch  

if and only if 

h was actually working with an organization to benefit and help veterans if he did that and it got even minimal press i think ppl would tune in 

it seems to me that he hosts the games and then disappears theres zero follow up on the athletes the help they get nothing 

idk anything about invictus are they an organization that puts these games on do companies sponsor the games is it a money making endeavor what do the athletes get out of competing in these games 
i thought i saw somewhere that somehow the rf was instrumental in starting it

these are the answers i would have liked to see answered from a docu of the games 

if its just disabled vets competing in sports then what sets them apart from the para olympics  i guess theres something to be said for it being all vets
so many arguments can be avoided if we just talk to each other 

everyone in my house knows when im going into the kitchen to cook did you not know she was  in the kitchen making supper  
did you not go in and ask what shes cooking  was supper supposed to be a surprise  notice you didnt mention or even suggest having something hot since they were out in the cold all day  

was she tired from being out doing an activity all day and just wanted to make something quick and easy quite possible or she planned that meal before they went skating and already had the ingredients 

this is so petty by both of you 

you shouldnt have made a face and she shouldnt be mad that you wanted to eat something else that you went and made
that is exactly what i said 

those kinds of opp sex relationships are the only ones that are acceptable
to cut contact with
im not sure how unpopular this really is 

if you cut contact with one or two of the opposite sex for an actual reason like theyre youre sexting partners who you dont have an irl friendship with then maybe its not a bad idea if its your decision 

but cutting all contact just because is ridiculous 
even more cringy is your new partner demanding that you cut contact with anyone of the opposite sex cant even like someones picture or make a comment  those people need a huge dose of reality but i think these cases are more a result of immaturity
 nope one hit and im out 
i dont care what you said to him 

it really is that simple

i could see him saying he had no idea what was going to happen at the coronation and that he had no choice but to say those words since he was put on the spot 

hell use the excuse that since nobody is talking to him they didnt explain what was going to happen at the coronation he just showed up thinking it would be like a church service or something 

could you just imagine the stupidly is endless
i agree with checking but then why would the h not be experiencing any issues its only her 

if he goes out of the house to work and she stays home could it affect her that much more i dont really know
honestly its not that hard to poke your head into whatever room theyre in to say hello when you get to your bf house you dont have to roam the house to find both of them but if theyre in the living room or kitchen its not that hard to do 
my kids so do that every time and then they go to their room 

the dog incident you should have had a lighthearted comment about it  would have been nice to know before she eats my hand or something 

did you say hi to his mom at work or were you waiting for her to engage you if youre still at work go over and say something anything start the conversation maybe say you bf told you why shes annoyed and apologize tell her youll do better from now on 

this should blow over but going forward make sure you say hello its just common courtesy 
and please dont stay over so much even if you dont think it it does disrupt the flow of the house
i see where youre coming from i really do and could understand where many people would have the same outlook as you 

but the royal family is not a govt its not a political body they have no legislative power 

they are however a focus of national identity and pride with a huge focus on service it is a thousands year old tradition that i would say has changed with the times as they are no longer the rulers of nations 

now if harry wants changes to the brf or the monarchy i have not seen one example of what he wants to change 
have you because if he did i missed it 

being a rebellious teen is nothing new but its a far cry from airing every perceived slight you have ever had in your life 

and again what terrible attacks has megan be subjected to 

the paper that printed the compton thing was chastised for it 
the tiara issue is in line with protecting the actual royal jewels 
the issue of who made who cry happened it wasnt some made up story someone let it slip but m and kate werent the only ones there something happened and neither you or me know the real story 
the fact that m cut off her whole family is true its human nature to want to know why and the media is right in trying to delve into why she was a very popular person at the time and most people thought it was a horrible thing for her as in what could they have possibly done to her for her to take so drastic a measure 

on the flip side there is no video evidence that they are or were being relentlessly pursued by paparazzi which they claim 
there is no verifiable info that anyone said or made any racist overtures to her which they claim 
according to them the proposal could be two diff times 
they were married 3 days earlier  proven lie  they didnt help with the finding freedom book thats a proven lie  there were leaks i agree im just not convinced every single one of them were coming from the palace so what benefit could mh have for leaking some themselves hmm

theres just a lot i mean a lot of discrepancies when they come out with their stories some probably have a grain of truth but the embellishment goes way beyond 

well agree to disagree and do it in a polite civilized way and thats a good thing
ok im gonna say this not to be mean but just as a thought since you havent given us much insight to your actual level of commitment 

you were dating 3 months which isnt very long 
hes been gone for most of your relationship 

you two have barely spent any of these 11 months together  if you even saw him at all since his deployment 

im thinking he may not be thinking this is as serious as you 
time alone is not a good judge of the seriousness of a relationship especially when you are apart

do i think he likes you sure he does but not enough to rework his whole life around you 
but is he sitting in his bunk pining away for you maybe not 

sorry again not trying to be mean
were you dating before he went in 
how long were you dating before he got deployed
thank you for the award
heres my take on all this

id point out that these arent 2 young people 
even when they met he was 32 and she was 34 hardly the age of naive change the world attitude 
both of them have years of life experience and know the ways of the world 
and hes been in this family has known exactly how it was run and worked and i dont ever recall him speaking out previous to megan about any toxicity  
note he could have i wasnt and still not obsessed with everything royal 

they lieproven they implynever a definitive explanation of this person said i said they never show any proof of the so called leaks or planted stories racist behavior or snub by anyone 

makes it kind of hard to believe what they say and a lot of it is just so freakin silly and stupid stuff that if it happened in your real life youd be thinking why are we even having this conversation 

its tiresome at this point 3 years since they left theyre not going to change the way the monarchy works its not their job it was never their job 
i dont know why they ever thought it was 

add to this their idea that they were going to be advocates of climate issues humanitarian issues womans issues whatever else and they have done exactly zero on any of these fronts 

they have literally not done anything but whine and complain and collect awards they did not earn 

thats why people dont like them not because of some fan girling of the royal family
so he drops the idea that the family or the palace planted stories when there was some kind of conflict 

ok then
you would think any journalist with any journalistic integritys next question would be
what was the conflict about and what story was planted can you give me an example 

but of course it never gets asked and were back to again accusations with absolutely zero evidence to back it up 

and this is exactly why i do not believe a word they say 

i believe there were conflicts either between members of the fam or even the palace bc thats just the nature of relationships at some point but i truly think the two of them wanted something wanted to do something or go somewhere and they were rebuffed for whatever reason 

so true to form for egotistical people they went immediately to a conspiracy against them instead of like a normal person trying to find a way to compromise and make it work 

and there were no leaked stories these two did something while out and about and the press wrote about
it whatever it was showed them in not the best light but instead of realizing they shouldnt have done that or said that they jump right to it must be a leak or a plant 

these two are so delusional it defies any sense of rationale
a couple things stood out as i read 

since the ultimate goal is for him to get his own apt hes essentially moving into your apt temporarily  in that case i think he could make it a point to just not put meat or fish in the refig 
will it be a pain sometimes yes it will but its your apt he can eat meat when you two go out or pick up something from fast food on occasion or if he really gets an urge for a steak on a random day he can pick 1 steak note 1 on the way home from work and cook it or he can get 1 burger from the butcher in the grocery store basically just enough for him to eat that one meal at home 
yes its not as convenient as having these all in the freezer but it is what it is 

it will work as long as he fully agrees to all of this with out moaning about it and you need to have this convo now not in the spring he needs to know this is a non negotiable and agree to it 

and then once he gets his own apt you have to be ok with him having meat in his refrigerator or freezer 

id also have him buy his own pans to cook any meat in just for your comfort if you need that 

also keep in mind it might take him a while to actually find a job in his field does he have a plan b in case that doesnt happen
oh i dont either but i was thinking thats the incident  op was referencing
so if he insinuated william cheated 
 do we think william will need to make some sort of statement or
 do we think itll be written off as just another lie

if he insinuated william didnt marry for love and there was another he wanted instead was there even ever another steady long term girlfriend that he dated who would believe that 

no way i believe william made any racist remark about what the baby would look like i dont know many men who would even think about it seems more like something women would chat about in a nice way
ah thank you  some kind of id makes so much sense 

id guess that when the ada for service animals came out there probably werent as many people faking and im sure way less people needing esas so it probably wasnt seen as needed because at the time who would ever question such a thing
i thought you werent allowed to ask what service is being done but i didnt even know there were any papers that can be shown so i learned something thanks for that info
isnt it true that there are no papers that show an animal is a service animal so anyone with a pet can claim whatever they want 

so the problem is theres no legal way to ensure that a service animal is actually one and thats why emotional support animals are being seen everywhere 

in my opinion a true service dog needs to have some kind of official papers that should need to be shown upon request to allow the animal into places that pets normally arent 

i dont think that anyone who actually needs a service animal would be put off having to show that it is an actual service animal
anyone who could find fault with something i do every single day is not someone id want to be with 
does he never mess up i bet he does but you dont point it out and rag on him for it 

you both have some issues youre not dealing with and if you want this or any other relationship to work youre both going to have to get help to get to a point that youre both mentally stable   you dont mention having any therapy but you both should be seeing someone
idk what you mean about getting a huge boost about rejecting men 

but doesnt it make sense that one can be wanting to find a partner but isnt willing to be with just anyone who happens to be male  or female it goes both ways 

everyone is only going to date people they are attracted to if they dont meet anyone who they like then why date them
 nta

but your wife saying that you shouldnt teach your kids to act a certain way so people will like them is correct 

but thats not what youre doing in this instance you arent fundamentally changing who your d is youre pointing out that lateness when boiled down is really about not valuing the person you are meeting and that friends will want to be valued and not made to seem like their time isnt important 

you wouldnt ask your d to change her clothes hair hobbies or opinions to fit in those are the things that make your d who she is youre just making her see that other peoples time is as important as hers 

try explaining it that way to your wife
listen to your mom 
we always discount her opinion but ultimately they are right 
she knows what she sees shes been thru it with your sisters 

this relationship is just not working 
its time to let it go for both of your sakes 
it will be tough for a few months but youll get over him and be fine
yeah shes being stupid 
maybe she enjoys the danger of it maybe she thinks is exciting 
whatever it is you warned her 

shell be crying soon because he dumps her and she caught feelings 
or shell be crying when she realizes hes just using her for sex 
either way its gonna be ugly
how does she know its really open 

if she wants to continue with this guy she should ask to speak to his wife to make sure it is really an open marriage 

in any event why does she want to expend any energy on a man who is taken
why would you not immediately turn around and go home when he told you he was homeless was he homeless with his 2 kids that live with him 
like where did he think you were going to sleep he had no car and 6 kids 


raise this baby alone he is useless 

he cant even support himself how do you think hes going to support you  you do not need the kind of support he is offering 

you seemed to be doing ok before you blew all your money on him 
plus his kids are a mess 

you will literally be moving into a nightmare 
please dont do that to yourself and your child
i have to know the trip to england that you described was that the only time you met him and was that when you got pregnant
omg that sounds like pure hell 
you have my sympathy 

youve got a few months till easter really work on hubby to get him on board with a schedule that doesnt 
have you running all the time
when you want to talk about your struggles without her trying to fix it you need to tell her youre not looking for advice but to just open up to her because you trust her with these things and so she can understand where youre coming from 

as far as her opening up maybe she doesnt really have anything to open up about not everyone has or had struggles that they need or want to talk about or maybe she just doesnt want to burden you with her stuff being aware that you have enough going on and doesnt want you dwelling on her crap too 

you can always go direct with her and tell her you want to develop a more intimate emotional connection and see what she says
nta

you need to have a conversation with your husband and decide what you want to do for all holidays next year 
decide on easter thanksgiving and both xmas days thats four so its easy to split them between the 2 families 

dont let him railroad you hold your ground if his parents have to see him every holiday then they can come to your house 

once you two have come to a decision then you have him tell his mom what the plan going forward is 

as an aside i dont know if xmas eve is the holiday your family usually gets together for and to add yet another wrench into the mix you might want to do xmas day at home so your kids dont have to leave their toys every xmas thats the one thing my h always said sucked  

as for this nye there would be no way in hell i would be having 5 pm dinner and then coming home and hosting a party thats insane send him to his moms for supper alone or with your son they will survive not seeing you for a few hours
just have kate send you your own invitation then youll be invited on your own not included on your dad and sms invite 

then find another single fam member and share a room with them to cut your costs 

you dont think they want you to stay home to watch the 3 yo do you 
thats a big fat no
eatontown has the most retched people on the planet 

i put all the docs i needed on the counter spread out so she could see every one of them 

that stupid miserable human wouldnt pick my document off the counter i had to pick them up and hand them to her one at a time 

havent been back since ill go to hazlet much more civilized there 

but the inspection people are very nice especially the woman who works there
nta

but your bf and cousin sure are 

what was he thinking he doesnt even know these people and he says crap like that  

your bf is disgusting why would you still want to date him
yta

if you cant handle your mom being away while you open a letter how in the world are you going to survive being away at college 

its past time that you learn to handle stuff on your own
try an audiobook 

i also like to scan the radio to see what kind of music is played in diff parts of the country
how old

and have you never spent any time with these kids before

are they always a bit rambunctious or is it maybe being off of school and holidays and their schedules being out of wack have them a bit crazier than normal 

you need to decide if you want to be with your bf bad enough to actually try to have a relationship with his kids actually if youre married youre already a step parent doesnt mean its all on you but you cant just ditch out whenever he has them thats a shitty thing to do they wont always be small and by the time they are old enough they wont want anything to do with you
so i kind of agree with you but just because i dont like oranges 

and im not a fan of mixed fruit salad theres always one fruit that gets mushy and then its mixed in with the other still good fruit

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

ok yeah his reactions are sketchy 

can you ask for a family meeting just to clear the air a bit obviously you dont want to live with any tension in the house you want your mom to be happy but this whole situation is out of left field 

other than that im out of ideas
since youre getting nowhere with your mom have you tried talking to him  
just at least to get a sense of him 
if hes a decent person hell understand if you preface with something like this is all new and odd to me having my mom move a guy in so can we just have a chat about whats going on here considering i didnt even know you two were having this ldr 

like what kind of job did he have maybe hes early retired and actually has some money or it could be he never had much of a career which is a red flag 
how olds the d does she live with the mom is he planning on keeping up visits is he responsible at least to his d 
does he have family siblings and does he get along with them 

then after a bit you can ask if he has any plan to get his own apt and job you know sort of just live in the same city and date you never really know a person just from online talking he might realize he doesnt actually like your mom 

cant hurt to try he might not even want to talk to you which would be weird or he may be fine with your obvious inquiry as to whats going on 
its def a strange turn of events in your moms part
okra 
i tried to expand my veggie eating but okra was just gross
thank you
is he planning on getting a job at some point his own apt 

for arguments sake lets say your mom and him really like each other fine his lease is up so they decide to have him move closer so they can date 
this is all ok as long as he stays with her but only until he can get a job apt and support himself 

if this is whats going on id say its crappy that she just sprung him on you did you even know she was talking to this guy 
like did she mention it at all
what a wonderful find 

for my bridal shower my mom gave me a set of embroidered pillow cases that my grandma made for me 

i had no idea they existed it was a really nice sentimental surprise she had been gone for a while by then 

oh and its been 33 years and i never used them idk why not i think i just wanted them to stay nice
are you saying you are seeing something diff

if so id like to hear yours please 

i dont know anything about how tarot works but it would be interesting to see what differs
while i agree she had to learn it somewhere but im not convinced its from her dad 

she seemed to have a regular upbringing by her dad albeit one where she was spoiled which would give her an inflated opinion of herself 

but once she decided to act is where i think she got the transactional idea 
i would think it happens a lot in hollywood you do this for me i do this for you 

it started with trevor  
i absolutely think she married trevor for that transactional relationship what he can do for her career and all she had to do in return was be with him when she had no use for him anymore he was discarded 

then it carried into everyone else she seemed to be friendswith 
sophie markus corey 

in every one of these relationships she was trying to do something that these people all were somewhat related to 
sophie and markus for highbrow connections
corey when she wanted to be a food blogger or whatever the heck she was trying to do 

so with h it was a case of this person has intl recognition is widely thought of as a decent person concerned with the environment and veterans and i want that too 

just a thought
i think its a matter of access 
if you always brought a person  into the fold  they can be family based 
on the person  bringing them in 

my adult kids  have brought people around sporadically  but if i know my kid is invested  in this relationship i treat them as one of the fam 
thats what you do you bring them in based on your child 
but i welcome everyone
nta

its not like he helps with anything else involving your apt so why would he think hed have to help with your nephews  

seriously hes nothing but a mooch 
all he pays for his his car and insurance  so basically just his stuff 

why are you allowing him to freeload off of you
nta

i dont even know why there was any awkwardness 

wife had friends over husband leaves to give the girls time to hang out 

now if you told your wife in front of jamie that you didnt want her there then it would be awkward but im assuming that didnt happen because based on the rest of the post jamie would have started something 

your wife really needs to start standing up to jamie tho the part about you and w not taking someone elses grief seriously is just so out of line and your wifes voice raising thing is something you would think jamie would know by now
how old is the brother 

does your bf hang out with him on his own 

if hes a bunch younger than you guys he might not want to hang out with  old ppl  not that youre old but to him maybe 

if hes closer in age then its up to your bf to plan a get together so you two can get to know each other better 

either way i say just go be nice 
dont try to force a connection if its not there
i just dont understand why this wasnt a conversation 

does he frequently make plans that youre not invited to 
why cant you and d go  brother is married so its not a boys thing

especially that hes gone for nye since we were dating weve always spent nye together 

i dont like your h at all
nta

you are already committed to be groomsman in the friends wedding 

thats a perfectly viable reason to miss the cousins wedding
nta 

but the second you walked in and saw the other dogs your h should have been the one to ask him mom what the deal was 

not you him 

its now days later you and h are upset at her shes probably pissed because she didnt see her son again and is of course blaming you and the fact that she lied to you about no dogs coming this year has still not been addressed 

its not gonna get better no matter what you do but h should be pointing out any snubs or nastiness from his mom every single time
i agree on the counseling 
at this point your normal is explosive arguing and neither of you have any idea how to get out of this cycle 

but also as an idea think back to your last argument that spiraled out of control and dissect it from beginning to end try to recall exactly what was said and by who 
do this just for yourself not to find who was to blame but to try to see where the disagreement went off the rails 
its always a good idea to have some kind of understanding of how things turn bad 

again not to place blame but to analyze  what the dynamic is like between the two of you and if you could have a do over what would you have said instead that may have changed the course of the argument 

a sort of self reflection
he knows but she doesnt 

its not like hes leaking this crap 
he has no idea half the time what shes orchestrating 

that doesnt absolve him of going along with all of it after the fact tho 
and ill bet once he figures out that its her she admits it but whats he gonna do he cant contradict her once its out there so he has to play the game her game
i agree 

there is no way back for them 

he might be brought back but not to the life he had 

hell be treated like andrew living a life far away from any royal duties he may be invited to select things like xmas church service but thats it 
well see him sporadically riding a horse or something 

im not even sure if the fam will let the kids back if she gets unsupervised visits h cant be anywhere near her alone once  if hes free of her grasp 
too much risk that hell say something that shell exploit
just have her cut down on both the riding lessons and the rock climbing unless she is competing in either sport 

neither of those two need to be done more than once if not competitive and money is an issue 
she already knows how to ride and climb after that its just for practice 

plus i think learning sign language is awesome
you have got to be kidding with this  

your bf wants nothing more to do with you youre a cheater 

leave him alone you cant get him back you dont deserve him
i couldnt read the article so sorry if this was in it 

it might be effective depending on what happens when you test positive if youre quarantined until you test negative then maybe it will be effective 


i think the bigger issue is since china isnt very forthcoming with any data they may have variants caused by mutations that the rest of the world hasnt even seen yet 

my biggest worry is a variant that is more dangerous that starts to spread well be back to the exact place we were at the beginning
this is less about you and your sister and more about what your parents should be saying to your sister 

they need to get her petty jealousy under control 

she made her choice of schools and you made yours it isnt as if your parents denied her the choice they need to explain that to her and tell her to knock off the rivalry 

your mom cant stay neutral when this is affecting the whole household and you dad needs to do more than just be pissed at sister
maybe because he said they bonded over their shared military service 
we dont really know that op even knew his grandpa had any money or if he did he assumed it would go to gramps child  ops parent 

op was at his lowest and sought out the person who could relate to what he was going thru after his deployment his visits could have started for that exact purpose but turned into wanting to make sure his grandpa wasnt alone in his last years 
its possible he actually enjoyed visiting 

i dont think we can understand what op went thru on deployment and how having that outlet was probably vital to his well being 

for all we know grandpa might have wanted op to have the money knowing he wouldnt be around forever and wanted to ensure op had the financial resources to get the help he needed in the future
its happening whether you fear it or not so just dont dwell on it 

concentrate on the excitement of the baby 

and like the other poster said you dont care about anything but getting that baby out of you youre just done being pregnant
obviously this relationship is not working  why would you want to put more effort in 

break up but take some time to get yourself straightened out nobody wants a sad depressed partner who wont talk to them 

once youre happy with and by yourself you can be a good partner to someone
if he says hes not very experienced i think in this instance you should believe him 

its possible he thinks you expect him to be good at sex given his age and since he doesnt have much experience he knows hes not and that makes him overthink and get nervous 

youve also only been dating for 3 months and as close as you are he might still need to be even more comfortable with you to be intimate 

dont stress over it and dont rush either
the problem with roaches in an apt building is that even if your gf bombs her place with the strongest stuff she can find shes gonna get them back again because her neighbors will still have them and roaches will eventually get back to hers 
thats why the whole building needs to be treated at the same time and even then theres no guarantee 

why didnt you use the same stuff on your gf apt that you used on your place 

roaches aside youre mean to your gf the coat incident was inexcusable
i agree i love a loaded salad its a complete meal
yta

so you make your gf leave your place after seeing one roach and that made her cry but then call her back to open presents  

then you gift her a used coat and when she doesnt want to wear it to this party you make her feel bad about it and tell her youll give it to someone else  of course shes gonna cry 

whats wrong with you  do you even like your gf  

she cannot help the roach problem you do know that right im sorry one hitched a ride over to your place but it happens 

then you get insulted she wont wear the coat because she wants to wear the other one she also just got and you go off on her  
leave her alone or be a nicer person
ok so not a therapist makes the scene a bit better at least 

but also not really therapy more like a self help audiobook 

thanks
i didnt watch past episode 1 but what kind of therapy is this 

and what ethical therapist would agree to have another person in a session taping it  
what kind of explanation could they possibly give to the therapist to make them agree to this
there are two things going on here and they are both on her to address 

first the physical pain she is having is clearly not normal she needs to see a gyno and see what is available as far as treatment is concerned has she never seen a gyno or just never brought up this problem 

the second is her mentally she needs to address the fact that she cannot open up to you due to whatever happened to her 
this is non negotiable sex is as much mental as it is physical and she needs to address both of these for you two to have a healthy sex life 

you need to let her know that a healthy sex life is something you are not willing to forgo and that its up to her to get the help she needs or you dont see this relationship lasting 
its just that simple 
 this is not a blame thing its just a fact that she is the one with the issues and shes not addressing them
i also thought that at 20 its cute to wear your bf initial 

at 24 and after 4 years you grow out of the cute phase
the thing is hes not really criticizing 

in your example he is saying that you should automatically know what he needs   
like are you supposed to read his mind  hes an ass just for that comment alone 

thats not bad communication thats a normal every day question that people would ask another when they see them a bit out of sorts 

and you had nothing to apologize for you did nothing wrong 


but i do agree with him that once you know what the problem is its better to ask to help instead of solve the problem for him those two statements arent really interchangeable 

overall his ego and self importance is way over the top hes not being honest hes trying so hard to prove to you and everyone else that hes so much better than you and them and when you and they dont come to that realization he outright tells them and you 

i give you credit for sticking it out for all those years
yup i did 

so of course i had to read the whole thing
can i point out that we havent gained a new wealth your bf has access to his savings acct 

otherwise you are nta but your sister owes an apology to your bf
 nta

what kind of weird crap is this  

im guessing you had no boyfriends until now and hes not even really a bf youre just hanging out  but not really cause you havent even seen him  just the fact that you physically leave the house freaks out your dad so of course the solution is to make you live elsewhere 

theres got to be more to this are you a deeply religious family is it usual to have an arranged marriage is the boy a diff religion race anything  

and whats with your mom not thinking your dad is a complete and utter wackadoodle and telling him so 

id say run as far and fast as you can cause your parents are nuts  grandmas is looking better and better but i know you cant do that
dont get stuff just for the sake of having 

pick walk art knick backs that actually have some meaning to them or youll end up with useless clutter 
every wall or shelf doesnt have to be full 

buy what you need and use what you buy once
what is wrong with your son  there must be something because 10 year olds arent usually this cruel and whats with him opening gifts before xmas  yeah somethings not right here 

im worried what hes going to do to his sister to get back at her for him not getting any gifts
thats how i saw it 

once her dad got the letter it became his property and he should be allowed to do with it whatever he wants
can someone explain the court case where she sued the mail about the letter 

did the court find in her favor without a trial 

and then when knauf gave his evidence which clearly showed she lied to the court did the court really just chalk it up to her not remembering writing a slew of emails 
thanks
awesome  thanks putting it on my list
do you mean its not a fun ship  in general what are the entertainment options  

i really like the look of this ship but i want some fun activities not all out crazy but i dont want the ship to be quiet by 10 pm 
hows the casino if you went

thanks
so you hate your lying   cheating secretive bf and you think your biggest issue is trying to figure out how not to have sex with him 

do you think hes suddenly going to have an epiphany of  wow my gf wont have sex with me better change my ways so she doesnt leave me

hes not going to therapy hes not going to change and hes not leaving 
the quicker you admit this the better you will be
yeah ive always thought the opposite 

i always wondered how many people they actually convert or even convince to check out the religion 

they really dont start the conversation with a compelling argument its usually a boring can i talk to you about 

i think they like having to go on these missions just to see diff areas of the country
hell tell you he appreciates all you do so that youll keep doing everything 

this right here is what you will be dealing with if you marry him he will not suddenly begin to pull his weight and his video game addiction will not just stop 

think long  and hard about if thats what you want in 3510 years
nothing else to be said you said it perfectly 

this is what she needs to hear and what she needs to do
congratulations  you should be proud of yourself im proud of you too
if the filled bread is put in a panini press i call that a panini 

if i grill the bread filled with ham and cheese in a pan on the stove top then its a grilled ham and cheese 

toast to me is just toasted bread topped with something  butter jellyetc and is eaten one slice at a time not put together like a sandwich 

and a sandwich is just two slices of bread with a filling whether its toasted or not
there is absolutely no reason for your wife to get that worked up over something so trivial ten minutes is not going to make a difference did she even feel bad about co ti king to blow up at you  

partners can only take so much abuse before they snap and you did but at least you recognize that its not a point you want to get to ever again so thats good 

time for some serious lay down the rules talk if she does this frequently explain that its not making a happy home for anyone especially your children she should not be ranting and raving over everything 

if its a one off find out why this day in particular she was so obsessed with d being ready at the exact time and by making a huge deal of it im sure she didnt leave when she wanted to anyway 

so what exactly did she achieve she achieved having her h disgusted by the her behavior and ultimately his own
 nta
how cheap is he that 40 is a big deal 

he knew it was going to be too big so its not really a surprise 
you didnt have another bag which he also knew so what did he expect you to do magically produce another bag out of nowhere 
your h is an ass
im leaning toward you being the ah but not on purpose youre young and probably havent had to make big decisions yet between a so and your mom and its overwhelming 

youve only been together 7 mo you see each other all the time over the course of the year and youre both pretty young 

i sympathize with your gf its obviously a terrible situation but she has family that can help her deal with grieving and while it would be great to be there for her its not like she will be alone 
plus im guessing this is the first time youre meeting her family they might not want an outsider around at this time 

on the other hand your mother is alone and im sure was looking forward to your visit its one of the few times she gets to see you all year 

go home and spend the holiday with your mom your gf has support but i would do anything for my mom and would never leave her alone on a holiday yes its only one day but the thought of my mom celebrating all alone with no joy on the day would kill me 

of course my thought is that you actually like and get along with your mom if you dont get along and dread going home ever then take the out and stay away 

i think they are both trying to guilt you into doing what they want make up your own mind what do you think is the right thing to do in your heart and your mind

edit  i just saw your mom could spend xmas with your aunt and uncle and isnt alone alone 
so no judgement still but id go home anyway
how long are you with your gf and also do you go to the same school or only see her occasionally
why are you even going to your dads if he treats you badly youre old enough to decide where you want to be for holidays 

where is your mom spending xmas 
i would think your mom would love to spend the first xmas after her husband passed with people who also  loved him 
also is your mom the mother of your sis and nephew that passed  even more reason to spend it with her
yta theyre both your nephews treat them the same or when the older one finally figures it out he wont want anything to do with you because of your disdain for him 

you might think the 20 yo is just being a bum and not actually finding himself but he may actually be trying to figure it out 

from experience  not mine tho 
some guys dont want college but they also cannot see themselves sitting in an office all day but they also cant see themselves doing an outside trade job 
yes its irrational  as it was to me to hear  to you because there arent many other alternatives but at some point they get a spark of something and it all comes together for them 

give him time you dont have to like it  it hes not your kid
i literally laughed out loud at that 

so i guess chris isnt allowed out of the bed until she gets her cuddles in 

what a ridiculously immature thing to think as a 26 yo never mind text to the mother of his child
youre not a loser nobody is a loser 


do you have a roommate why arent you friendly with him 

join a club at your school or an intramural team or volunteer somewhere on campus

or just start saying hi and talking to every  person you see in your dorm building 
why havent you done this the first week you were on campus when literally every club was looking for people 

youre not gonna make friends if you shut yourself away nobody is gonna come knocking on your door and say hi i want to be your friend 

and dont worry so much about attracting girls because with your attitude of thinking of yourself as a loser girls sense that and they want no part of it 
the gym is good as long as you go to better yourself and not just to attract someone 

get out there and just do something the pieces will all fall into place
we just did a dinner out with immediate family godparents and grandparents
your argument against judging by todays standard is spot on 

you dont have to like what the person did or stood for in their time but the fact remains that it was acceptable in their time it happened and was celebrated 

key point is  at that time   

better to show those statues and have a discussion about the person the act the time in history than to lock them away and never discuss to understand what was going on at that time 

that is history for good or bad
info 

how old is your son his kids and your younger kids 

does your dil work
we used to rent strollers and when we returned the stroller we were given one but only 1 around 9700

thats where i got mine 
they are in the photo albums from the trip
yes 

and honestly if they would drop the titles and go on their merry way without any mention of his mom his family her family the press i would wish them well in their merchandising endeavors  well id really be rooting for failure but

just go do whatever the hell you want to do as just h and or m write a blog do a reality show pick a cause and champion it just please no more podcasts that was painful just leave everyone else the hell alone and live your freakin life already
ive been keeping up saw a bunch of clips read a bunch my post just tipped the iceberg as you probably know 

cant wait for the fallout from the book
only the first episode 
did i miss something
we loved that ride  sad to see it go 
and we dont really like the new railroad thing 

some rides are just classic and shouldnt be messed with
oh where to start
this might get long 

try to figure out how they met theres been about 3 diff versions
2 diff versions of the proposal and one that she filmed and live streamed to a friend who does that
now they might want these things to be private but then why even talk about it on a netflix show and out out diff versions 
pretty strong evidence that she had been planning to merchandise her and h and the royal connection since before they were married 
she lies about her childhood dumps her dad who raised her and suddenly her mom is in the picture to capitalize on her mixed race when up until then she was self identifying as white that rubs ppl the wrong way 
add in her admission of wanting to harm herself while pregnant but then not getting any help while being principals in a mh foundation never mind h admitting he didnt know how to get her help and the fam would not help when they didnt really ask for it 
m being on a royal tour complaining that shes not getting paid for this

then she and harry are saying she was discriminated against based on her race if it happened they are right to call it out but they have not given one instance of it its all vague cryptic statements 


she claims being harassed by paparazzi but there is no evidence of that she claims the fam leaked stories to the press yet no evidence she didnt like negative stories in the press and wanted the fam to get them taken down the fam doesnt have that power but she took it as they wanted to slam her 

add in h harping on all day long about his dead mom and his generational pain and its just become a clown show at this point and a lot of his behavior has come out since hes been with her so what has she said or done to him to make him turn on his family 

she wants to be a globally known brand she wants fame and money and status shes been trying to do this for almost all of her adult life it hasnt happened even with her marrying into a very famous and influential family and shes grasping at whatever will keep her name in the spotlight
hes just a middle aged man who gained weight and is in his own home where he can be comfortable 

we all have spent days just lounging around looking sloppy and so have our partners 

he looks presentable when he needs to cut him some slack on this one
nta

this is an absolute nothing your gf is being ridiculous good lord its like middle school 

your gf is getting upset over your passcode  read that again your passcode on your phone 

you must be the most perfect man on the planet if this is the thing shes choosing to get upset about 

i dont care if youre good or bad with tech or know how to change it there is no reason to and thats what you should tell her
mazda 3 

were on our third one 

the 2009 is still being driven by first kid 
2014 is now the second kids car 
2017  is ours
how else are we supposed supposed to hear his generational pain if hes not the one speaking  
how will we know how tortured his life was 

maybe hell choke up a bit at timesreally try to pull at the heartstrings 

if were really lucky we might get an actual sob
yta for putting up with that loser and his freeloading sister and her kids 

why are you with him  he obviously doesnt give a crap about you 

give yourself the biggest gift this year your independence from him
you just started talking and youre already spoiling her  in what way 

she comes with a lot going on  living with baby daddy not financially independent and has 2 very very young kids you cannot possibly want to take on all of that can you afford to support all 4 of you and more importantly do you even want to  

im getting not on the up and up vibes from her id pass on this one there really isnt any upside for you
i dont get angry or upset it just causes unconscious eye rolling which id like to avoid 

any qs where someone wants their so to basically have zero contact with anyone of the opposite sex no talking no friends on sm 

friends from childhood gone
lab partners  gone
study buddies  gone 
co workers they talk to  gone
exes  gone 

theres only one person who they should cut contact with and that would be an affair partner and you 

you arent mature enough no matter your age to be in a relationship if you have this view

edit and as soon as i posted the next feed is my bf is still friends with his ex 
insert eyeroll
the driving might just be an age thing as stupid as that sounds but teens speed i might also let whoever that minor in the car with him that asking him to go faster is a def no go 

the more concerning part for me is when you said that when things are going well in life he feels uncomfortable 

if he doesnt know now might be a good time to open up about his moms behavior over the years is your ex actually diagnosed or are her issues your best guess 
if diagnosed it might help to move your son to be more open to therapy if he can see what his future may look like if he doesnt get a handle on it now 

its tough because you dont want him to think that you think  in his teen mind hes crazy or mental or insane or any other euphemism he might use so tread carefully
and why isnt knauf just releasing these writings 

i also find it hysterical that they seem to think knauf is biased because he was working for william 

they left and the guy had no job he was obviously good at whatever he did enough that the dumb dumb duo used him as their go between with amid the scabies 

so the royal household or office or whatever gave him another job was he supposed to just disappear into oblivion after being used by the despicable duo
no not normally 
they might thank their parents and their guests for coming but this

this is just cringy 

if you have to convince anyone that you have a grand love story than you dont have one
unless she just doesnt 

whats gonna happen the rf wont allow a scene to be made 

they will once again do and say and get away with whatever they want 

best the fam can do is have them sit in the cheap seats along with other non family members
maybe think of it this way you were the handful and got the attention you needed enough so that you cant even remember what you were doing to warrant all that extra support and wasnt it nice that your parents were there to do that h

now its your bro needing the extra and youre upset but you need not be because his time needing the extra will end at some point 

then all will go back to normal with your parents being annoyingly up your butt again  cause thats what we do 

its hard trying to be the all for everyone at any given time one kid or the other will need more and we have to give it and yes sometimes at the expense of the other kid but it all will even out in the end 

if you get to the point where you have a problem or issue that seriously needs to be addressed then you voice that to your mom or dad and ask for some one on one time outside of the house to concentrate on that one issue if they say no then you reiterate that this is important and youre not just being whiny 

but i will say that just feeling like they arent validating your existence isnt really serious if and thats only if your bros issues are a serious thing i dont know what hes dealing with
it should revive itself once the kids get a little bigger 
but you have to keep it somewhat going or it becomes the new norm 

like its not gonna be ok the kids are all somewhat self sufficient enough to not be all energy consuming and youll both have this unbridled passion for each other 

it needs to be a constant even if its a once a month type thing now thats at least a constant then it becomes twice a month and then once a week or whatever
is there anyway to heat the mm tube enough to soften the butter and banana enough that you can get the cylinder out maybe boil some water and put the tube in it for a few seconds 
or try to cut the tube with a scissor 

i am kind of curious how this situation happened if you dont mind sharing
maybe some scratch offs small keychains packs of sports cards mini candies
i wouldnt buy one but if you get an actual card then i could see people buying it 

just for the historical implication of it 
theres no doubt all his ridiculousness will be written about at some point might be kind of worth it to have one maybe  

thats the only reason i bought the 5 campaign buttons just to have a little piece of history because hes just that absurd  please dont slam me for this yes i know it was another 5 in his coffers but whatever
do these two actually believe anyone gives a rats ass where they are at any given point in time 

in case they or their minions follow along here no 

the answer is no 
nobody cares go away
while i agree there will be headlines either way but what will they look 
like

will it be they were snubbed and rightly so  which seems to be the way its going with the response to the docuwhine or because of what the book says or whatever else they just feel like vaguely moaning about 
or 

will it be the rf or kc is too soft on his wayward son and what will it take to finally be done with them how far is too far he literally called his father a liar  what he lied about is still anybody guess as they never give any concrete statements so i guess kc can use that as an excuse

weve got a few months so lets see what else happens
lady hussey really should have declined to even meet her 

what did she get out of it  nothing the damage has already been done its not like marlene took the blame and admitted it was all a set up 

theres no way i would ever even want to make all nice with that conniving grifter
for me the gospel choir at the wedding would have been a beautiful addition if and only if megan or even just her mom had a longstanding relationship with a church that actually has a gospel choir hell even if she used to go as a child  and stopped as an adult to a church with one maybe she did and i missed that little fact 

i could be wrong but i equate gospel choirs with a predominantly black church which i actually like i think it makes the service idk less boring and it adds to the service lets face it church service is boring 

so the fact they added the choir literally just to play into her woc persona just didnt sit well with me as much as i enjoyed watching it
i agree but his gf already doesnt want to stay at borgata 

we stay and play at b even tho we havent won there
oh this made me think of something 

maybe it wasnt leaks to make them look bad but merely something they were doing in an official capacity but like everything else she does she missteps during it and thats what gets picked up by the journalists 

so for example if they visited a hospital of sick kids she refuses to touch or hug the kids   the paper would say yeah they visited but she was repulsed by sick kids or something like that 

so the story was bad but not by any fault of the family or palace
stay at borgata for the free room and go over to ocean to play 

if youre going very soon be prepared that borgata is in the midst of renovating some slot areas there are a bunch of closed off sections so it looks messy 
if your gf doesnt really want to go anyway shell def not like it once she sees it
but shell pick and choose select lines from long posts that are someone commenting things like what if is it possible allegedly and i heard a rumor that

and then say see theyre spreading all these lies 

shes not gonna show a post saying they did this on this day and then said this on this day whats the truth 
or posts that point out evidence of her obvious lies
of course its gayle he wont be asked about anything thats been revealed as being a lie or deceitful 

shell lob softball qs that have been answered ad nauseam in three diff ways maybe hell have a fourth answer 

who at this point will even watch this drivel  

unless its live and a respectable hard hitting journalist i think im busy cleaning bathrooms that day
i love this idea  

maybe explain a bit more to the child in an age appropriate way about why actually being called mom  because she does actually have a live mom even tho she doesnt see her might not be the best name as opposed to whatever other name they come up with just so the little girl doesnt feel totally rejected
its possible his collar is visible when hes carrying lilly that way 

if the collar is not buttoned all the way up like if you are wearing a tie they are actually roomy plus the front of the shirt would just slide up 

plus shes a small child she can def fit between his collar and his neck 

i dont know if its photo shopped or not but the collar is not a smoking gun to me
but what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda after breaking up 

and if it was while they were together again what kind of stupid ass would sign an nda while dating a nobody 

i think they dont want to get pulled into her crazy
i think youre getting ahead of yourself here 

lets say that someone legitimately not mentally ill gets kidnapped gmafb they will be placed assessed and have you ever thought that maybe just maybe they will be referred to somewhere that will help address whatever their issue is since its not mh this is a good thing 

you seem to think an actual mental health provider is going to hold people that dont need their services when in actuality those providers want to free up space for the ones that they can actually help 

stop looking for abuse everywhere give the program a chance before you condemn it 
you say if they want to help then get to the root cause  well thats exactly what they are trying to do
we were one of the million that actually watched the show we liked it too but even back then i remember i didnt like her character and it wasnt personal to her just didnt like her storyline 

but it never registered to me that she was mixed race i wasnt looking for it i dont remember it being in any plot line and i just didnt make the connection until her dad was introduced and then was like   huh shes black then happily went back to watching and even now i dont remember if there was any substantial plot regarding her race but i could be wrong there
all this is for nothing if theyre not even invited 

would anyone really be surprised if they werent  

dont announce theyre not invited and maybe use their pr to ask media to not even mention the are they arent they invited 

im sure m will make it known but if the uk press doesnt report it how much traction can they get  after a while the us press will realize they as a whole are a non story
no one treated her like a black person 

because no one even knew she was half black  kind of what happens when you yourself hide that info 

of course when she starts to date h did anyone care to want to know anything about her background as would have happened with anyone he dated lets be real the press would have dug into anyones background and found the worst things they could 

but notice she has no instances of how she was treated differently

the compton and chimp thing was over the line no doubt but as pointed out those were condemned by the press against the press
if they release any recordings even if its so called shocking people who dont really have an opinion either way will suddenly have one and it wont be in their favor 

regular every day people know that families arent perfect and have their dirty laundry but we dont air it
same kraft is great when i want quick but homemade is a treat to myself

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw

sorry but ywbta to demolish it 
the prudent thing to do is to sell it and split the proceeds among the kids 

i can sort of understand your attachment to the home you built but really youll be dead you wont know or care who will be living there 

and think about it this way
 from your description whoever buys it will be wealthy and will go in and change it to how they like it and that might upset you to think about but its going to become someone elses dream house another family that will raise their children to have the happy childhood that you were able to give your kids that legacy alone should give you some peace 

the worst part of this whole story is that your kids are already fighting over who deserves the house more 

im sorry what here i was thinking your kids had an awesome upbringing going and then we see that they have turned into greedy self serving adults 
cause lets face it one of them will get the house maybe live there till they realize its too expensive to maintain it and then theyll sell it anyway and keep that windfall 
in the process their sibling relationships will fail 

stipulate to sell the house if one of your kids can afford it they are more than welcome to bid on it
well that blows my theory out thanks tho its good for me to know going forward
i probably wouldnt be able to do a perfectly proper curtsy if i was put on the spot  which is a ridiculous claim that she didnt even know the q was going to be there but id sure as hell try to do something genuine looking 

the q seemed to have a funny side so if it came out looking like a baby deer learning to walk shed probably laugh it off id be mortified but id apologize anyway and promise to learn the diff is i would actually learn how 

but that witch of a champion of women feels its beneath her to even to the most esteemed woman in the world
my theory is that when you first start out it allows for typos and small errors like missing accent marks 

as you progress it marks them wrong because it thinks you should know that by now 
as of now i havent been marked wrong for the accent marks yet and i hope it doesnt happen in the future 

im only unit 6 so still early and i may be wrong but words that i misspell are usually many letters so its easy to misspell when starting out but the ones that ive seen for a while get marked wrong
she cant get specific because everything they said happened didnt 

its too easy to go back to that person and have them refute it all 

and they think theyre smarter than literally every single other person on the planet and that we wouldnt see right thru that 

at this point they can have a public ccv camera that recorded literally any mundane thing that they did and i still wouldnt believe it happened if it came from them  

they have lost all credibility and rightly so
or she just doesnt like the name harry she thinks william got the cooler name  h isnt a very oooular name in the us i dont think 

who knows in her deluded mind 

do you think she calls him hazbeen when shes raging at him  that would be priceless
i do agree with taking some time to cool off if you say thats what youre doing and its a short amount of time walk around the block go for a drive but op also says she went and stayed with her parents for a few weeks  

thats not really a cooling off period seems more like trying to solve that problem from afar and we dont know if h took a small time to cool off or hes still gone 

but again a short cooling off period is sometimes a good thing
especially that both of them have left the home after an argument 

that is not a healthy way to resolve conflict
love that last line  its so simple but so true

of course your son would be upset with you 

do you really think he would tell you hes gay if hes not or if hes not sure  he has a boyfriend even  

how your son looks or his hobbies and interests have absolutely no bearing in regard to his sexuality i dont know why you would even think that 

you owe him a huge apology if hed even accept it 
be a better parent
im sorry but i am failing to see what you are so mad about 

are you mad because they lied to you all these years  

well id be willing to bet that there have been a lot of people who over the years have lied to you about one thing or another this lie really has no bearing on your life it hasnt made it better and it def hasnt made it worse this is an absolute nothing i find it extremely hard to believe if you have never lied to anyone why was it ok for you to tell a lie but not anyone else 

or are you mad about the age gap being what it is

in which case that really is not your business they were both adults when they got together and thats really the only thing that matters 
they have stayed together so that in itself should show you that they are happy together 
now you may feel a bit weirded out by the gap but that is your personal moral code and you have no right to impose or pass judgement on anyone even if its your dad 

it seems you are taking this news way too personal as if something was done to you your life was a happy one with sam in it why would you purposefully make problems when there really isnt one
why are you even looking at 3 br homes  
your realtor should not even be showing you them 

keep looking you will find a 4 bed that will call to you just as much as this one and you will be grateful when 2 teen girls are not fighting over space
i have 5 siblings i can honestly say i have rarely bought any of them gifts for their bday and i like and get along and hang out with all of them 

it just isnt a thing occasionally if its a big bday and theyre having a party for it then ill get a gift 253050th

as far as im concerned parents get gifts for everything 

if this is your partners only sib then an xmas gift is ok since shed be left out when every one is opening gifts 
but id stop the bday gifts
ah thank you i was obviously confused 


i thought the prince title could never be removed and i thought the king couldnt remove the duke title that it had to be done by parliament and that this bill would give the king the power 
good to know parliament can at least do some stripping of titles at some point 

ill refrain from commenting till i understand the whole issue it does get confusing 

personally id like both titles stripped from h he hasnt lived up to either of them 

as far as andrew as long as he keeps himself hidden away i can wait for his turn in the next round  not that i condone anything he has done but hes at least staying within the bounds the q set for him
parliament doing the stripping would be the best thing that could happen 

maybe kc can put out a weakly worded statement in opposition just to appear to give a sht but if it comes from above him theres nothing he can do about it 

maybe parliament can throw around some key words treason grievous harm prosecute etc
youre not the only one who doesnt drink just dont make a big deal out of it or talk about those that do 

go to the parties grab a soda and have fun nobody is going to know or care
since i have no experience in nursing but frequently am the visitor to a patient frequently admitted  chronic issues

i like the idea that i can go in to visit and connect with a nurse to give me the daily update too often i have no idea what the diagnosis actually is and the waiting for a nurse to have the time to come in and advise is usually long i dont think that aspect harms patient care many times i have questions later on and this would be helpful 

i dont have an issue with a virtual doing paperwork things like discharges but maybe the actual on site nurse should have to sign off on the paperwork thats been prepared thats a good check and balance in case something has been missed or overlooked by the virtual that isnt actually seeing the medical state of a patient 

im not sure about admission assessments i would think theres a lot of nuances that in person can pick up on i would think patients especially older folks would downplay their illness pain uncomfort but in house might pick up on all this 

the idea of a virtual monitoring labs or electronic monitoring info may prove helpful but only if its being done in a timely manner sort of like what good is a lab report that needs immediate action if its not being looked at immediately no matter whose looking 
theres always a fear with this that virtual nurses will evolve into doing too much and things will slip thru the cracks almost like how if an in house nurse is so busy the virtuals will eventually become too overloaded as well because really they still need to be paid and it does seem that hospitals are all about cutting expenses anyway 

do you think a program like this could eventually lead to too few actual nurses on the floor and what could that mean for patient care 

thanks for posting its certainly an interesting idea
those eco warriors dont you just love them 

but if it was a borrowed plane its ok right  all the carbon footprints are someone elses 

oh its for security they say  yes well theyre doing such good things in the world someone just must be after them to stop them from ridding the world of all those racists 

did i miss any other excuses
if they were editing based on public opinion there would be no show 

what they should be doing is taking what they say and present the other factual side of the whole damn story
nta

stay at your brothers and dont even answer her texts 

she needs to learn that she cant keep pushing shes going to have to figure out a way to not need constant attention from you 

take your time to figure out what you want to say then text her with that 

dont get into a pissing match with her about your action of leaving just concentrate on her actions her actions had consequences too bad so sad
yta

seriously how long are you going to coddle the 24 yo 

she obviously has horrible taste in men and if i had to guess your and her dads marriage wasnt great and thats part of the reason why 

she needs help but in the professional way not mommy cleaning up after the fact 

do you not remember when your older kids were in hs and how important dances proms plays sporting events were  

you have done this all 4 times but your d is doing all this for the first time  think about that for a bit
 thats the kinda the point 

it was 1 day that you specifically asked for and he couldnt even just handle it and not moan about it 

and this 1 day was when you were going to give birth to his child 

but good luck today may your labor be quick and painless my third was the easiest delivery and the easiest baby too
nta

your h really couldnt help  and i hate that he even thinks hes helping when its his kids get the kids situated one morning 

i was a sahm for all my kids i readily volunteered for all night stuff because my h had to get up early for work 
but if i had a bad night or couldnt settle the baby and woke him he never bitched and moaned about it he got up did what he had to do and went back to sleep 
was he a bit more tired at work im sure but weve all been tired at work for whatever reason 

i dont understand a partner that moans when they have to do one teeny tiny thing other than what has been deemed their chores or their part 

like seriously are we partners or are we two people who share space and children
i read one article where h said theres a hierarchy of the family

he cannot be that stupid 

like yeah duh 

youve been doing this your whole life and just figured out that the monarch comes first the heir second and so on down the line  

i really think the dumb duo mean
we wanted to do something and they told us no because cs or ws thing takes precedent
the first snow of the year is always so beautiful isnt it  

i hope your pups  enjoyed it
i hate saying this because whats done is done but  you bothered to read about the failure rate about bcps  but that still didnt register to you that you should have been using condoms also i dont fault you for believing her when she said she was on the pill but oh man shes something else 

so that out of the way im not judging cause this is just way to big to judge on teenagers 

has she even said that she wants to keep the baby thats what you need to ask 

then what you do is tell your parents that shes pregnant 

you cannot handle this by yourself 

again in case you didnt get it the first time

you cannot handle this by yourself 

you her and both sets of parents need to sit down and figure out what you are all going to do 

you cannot make her get an abortion you may voice your stance that you are not ready to be a dad but she will do what she wants 
this is why you need adult parental guidance
im a little confused with this story but why dont you write the letter but not send it 

give it to a friend to destroy 

maybe just the act of doing it will be enough
yta
just for the fact that they are coming on xmas day and also staying for 2 nights 

isnt that enough 

honestly im surprised theyre not spending the holiday with her dad and or her siblings 
 we did that the first xmas after my mom passed i usually swap years with my inlaws and it was their turn but i just felt i had to be with my fam  and it was hard
but also that before this move she only moved 20 min away yet they havent seen her in ages 

theres is def a reason she doesnt want to see them
im more curious about the tweet never saw that before 

id say the acct was hacked just based on the way it sounds but really some random hacker had months to figure out how to get into the acct just to tweet this 

what are the chances some hacker was invested in their story so much to spend their time doing this as opposed to idk literally getting into any other legitimately important persons acct  

maybe some palace insider just wanted to give them grief whether true or not and planned to tweet and delete on the off chance someone got a screen shot of it 

or m did it just to be able to say the rf wanted to ruin her by putting it out there 

idk why but i find this hysterical
there is no excuse for what he did you really have no idea what he did with those recordings id be gone 

whatever you do one thing would be certain for me never another intimate video call or even a phone call
ooh attacking american values  thats a new one 

its not enough the fam didnt like her now lets have them hating a whole country
the only thing that might be somewhat new would be the people who didnt want them to marry 

we know william tried to slow h down but were there any others maybe charles or camilla suggested they wait to see if she fits with the fam or if shes up to the kind of life of service thats expected  or simply if she really just wanted h 

im sure theyll spin it to because theyre racist when we see now that all those objections would be true 

one things for sure h and m will not be telling any stories with any kind of detail that could show any kind of slight against them 
such as we were working with a to do a named project and person b did this and then said x 

itll all be very superficial i got the impression someone was trying to ruin a project  no name that we were trying to  start up 

i hope thats understandable it made sense when i thought it
thats weird thats what fixed mine 

i am not techie at all so id say uninstall and reinstall but
only if you remember your login 

sorry im out of ideas
update the app
we need to know what your mom said
i had the same 

update your app it fixed it for me
so like if he didnt even know the woman was pregnant 
yeah id be ok with that  good point
oh geez could you just imagine he asks for a test and hes the one with random offspring out there 

way to shoot yourself in the foot  
karmas a bitch
one more thought if you have friends that will vouch for you maybe you can ask them to co sign on a lease 

that might solve the credit issue 
then when the lease comes due and you fix the credit issue you can ask the landlord if they will do another credit check to see if youd be good on your own 

sorry just throwing ideas out there
def not a prude its just an unusual situation wanting to see his accomplishment and also what makes this photographer so good at what they do and what they can capture what feelings the photos elicit 

as i said have someone cover what you dont want to see 
it would then be like what he shows in a bathing suit 

but at least youd be able to appreciate the art aspects of the photos
good point about objects blocking his bits 

if that was the case she wouldnt be worried about viewing the pics but we really dont know either way youre right
 nta


that cousin tho wow  i really have no words 

you take care of yourself and when you feel back to fighting weight you give that rude condescending ah of a relation a huge verbal ass whooping 

family harmony be damned she needs to be called out and called out loudly she needs to be ostracized by the family
you have an income that would afford you a pretty good life 
air bnbs are gonna cut into that i would think pretty quickly 

instead of trying to get an apt that would have a credit check maybe try to find a roommate situation 

after that you need to build more credit cc might not be viable but a monthly subscription to a magazine would help  i did that when i first started out 

and dont stop with the credit companies fight until you get an answer from them of what documentation you need to accept the name change and then get it to them  maybe check with a lawyer if what they are doing is even legal and send your docs with a letter from the lawyer
she knows theres a racial divide still in america and she plays off that

this is exactly why she plays it up so much 

dont you know she can single handily cure the world of racism if she could just let everyone in the whole wide world know that she and she alone is calling out racism 

oh and that pesky resume listing her as white  well the racists in all of hollywood would never ever cast her if they knew she wasnt lily white 

shes got nothing else to be victimized for


id want to see them for the art aspect of it but as a mom of grown boys im with you where it seems idk the word  ick no strange maybe just some things moms dont need to see yes 

this will sound weird but maybe have someone cover his bits so that you can still see the pictures
yta

youre jealous of a then 15 yo when your bf was what 23 

get over it already youre punishing a young woman who may have had a teenage crush 

i am curious tho how he even met her and were they friends in a sense that at 23 he was hanging out with teens  
that would say a lot more about your bf than this girl
at this point  30 years and all kids are adults now and never ever having this convo
go for it  knowing its a total and absolute waste of money 

although id probably ask to do something like a 23 and me for all of us this way well get all the ancestry in addition to the bio relationship 
 kind of curious if all the kids ancestry would be exactly alike
two birds one stone
you know you should get out but why should you leave  if hes done then he can get out 

but id worry about my name being on the lease 

if its just your name then he leaves 

if its both of your names then dont go anywhere until you can figure out something with the landlord to get your name off
if he stops paying youll be on the hook for it
omg just plan to have a meal with each parent and their so if you have to meet them pick a restaurant have a meal then d can go home with gma or gpa for her visit 

do you not talk with or visit when you drop off your d  just how amicable is your relationship with each parent
id be more concerned that since your dad is wanted in that country if they have been keeping tabs on him the govt might just know that his wife and d are arriving 

but i have no idea what country youre talking about t might be turkey in which case i dont know if id be that comfortable going 

just use the vacay money to bring a few relatives to you

other than the house which i agree would cost them a lot of money each month and the nannies what else do they do that they pay for

theyre not jetting around the world on humanitarian missions in which theyd need transport and lodging 

theyre not invited to award shows or hell even dinner parties with the a listers in which theyd need to buy something new to wear 

i dont pay too much attention to their day to day but theyve gone out to dinner what 2 times  oh and cant forget he uvalde visit 

so if they werent so full of themselves and had to have a huge home for 4 of them theyd probably be doing ok

edit  nope they wouldnt be ok 

did some digging their monthly expenses are estimated at about 360000 plus repaying the frogmore renovations of 18000 per month  idk maybe 20000
and this is not including landscaping maintenance which i couldnt find 



these 2 are screwed
i have no doubt that she can have a platonic relationship with a guy especially if hes a family friend  someones son that her parents were friends with and therefore they grew up together 

but if you know for a fact she lied you need to talk about it why did she lie 

you say youre young how young 

when we are just starting on our dating journey it is possible we lie because we dont want to upset out bf gf of course our inexperience leads us to believe the other person will not know but with social media it always comes out 

talk to her in a non accusatory way 
you know her best is she coming across as truthful does she seem like shes lying or trying to hide anything from you 
what is her reasoning to deceive you while snapping from another guys bed  seriously where was he

honestly if your gut is saying theres more to this there probably is trust it

if youre not long term id say just cut your losses and move on 

of course im of an age where we didnt have sm so a lot of this is just bizarre to me
love or need of her 

if he ditches her wheres he gonna go
yeah what stakes 

there are no stakes its not a competition theres nothing to lose  

just go live your fn life and stop making every freakin thing about your what 72 days as a royal
 
she really is a waste of life
im sorry there is absolutely zero reasons why this bill should not be pushed thru and voted on 

it should be obvious to anyone in parliament that these two are not good for the uk never mind the rf 

and id be ok with a bill that strips the prince title too  unless its better to try the second born son for treason 
in which case im ok with that too 

whatever it takes to get them distanced for the rf
dont you want to spend the holiday with your family 

if you think this is a long term thing you may as well get used to switching off or just spend it with your own family again and meet up later 

dont tell him you hate spending time with his family we all grow up getting used to our own familys way of doing things 

try to find something you can relate to with his mom i know its hard you have nothing in common with a middle aged woman 
keep it light tv shows local news maybe your job places youve visited etc 
and im sure you know no religion or politics
who was taking all these pics  

theyre not official royal duty pics so what they had someone follow them around while they were dating before they got engaged during wedding planning  and the rf allowed this 

did she plan on a doc that early on 
thats some serious long con
and adding in
 you know because no one protected my mum and we all know how that ended 
im gonna watch it have to see how they spin literally everything to their advantage
but how else will they get sympathy if they dont play up how badly they are suffering if we dont see it
oh yeah i read the daily mail every morning 
the amount of articles is unbelievable 

clicked one  but only one since i read here about not giving them clicks to read harry saying something about not knowing what goes on behind closed doors 

ironic no   considering what probably goes on behind their door

i can just imagine tw waking this morning screeching to hazbeen   look im everywhere
just tell her she agreed to the 100 amazon budget and then spent more with her sis 

if she wants more it has to come out of her separate account 

its kind of silly to buy so much the first year half the fun is adding on each year and seeing how your tastes are going to change each year
im going to assume your parents have met the bf and like him 
that is literally half the battle 

but oh boy this has disaster written all over it and i hate to say it but if it goes badly i think itll be your parents fault 

off the top of my head

first off you have got to beat into your parents head that they are absolutely not allowed to talk about their wealth at all  no way no how 

make them understand that saying anything that might reflect badly on his parents is just not done in polite society 

then forewarn his parents about how your parents are maybe explain that your values arent theirs and ask them to please dont get into it with them and to not take anything they may say personally as much as they would want to

who knows tho maybe they will all get along and all your worries are for nothing 
good luck
sorry i dont care how close friends they are those kind of flirty messages are never  their way of communication 

if you have to live constantly checking his phone hes not worth it youll never get to a place where you trust him again therefore leading to never giving your all to this partner and a relationship needs those things 

its really not that hard to not flirt with others if you are truly invested in the one youre with
nta

should have done it long ago and just not said anything 

she probably wouldnt have even noticed 

and really she wont come over anymore second problem solved
keep the album especially if you have kids 

both my parents are now passed 

my sister happened to take my parents wedding album home from visiting my step dad one day 

she brought it over and it was really nice to see them when they were young and in love 
they divorced when i was small and my dad passed a few years later

and putting faces to grandparents i dont really remember 

they are memories you cannot capture from any other pics that might be floating around
my truth 

your truth is your perception of a situation or your opinion or just you lying 

there is only the truth
as bizarre as it is that he talked about his book and recounted stories its even more bizarre to me that hed get mad when others tried to change the subject 

like what these arent his friends he can get drunk and vent to these are business associates 

but i guess when you have no friends youll vent to anyone you can get and if he hadnt made this situation all on his own it would be really sad  but he did so its not
are you upset that he put down single and that he may get in trouble for it 

or are you upset that youre not on the house and think if he put down married you would somehow own half the house
nah


it seems to me that you havent had so much as a conversation with your mom about any of this 
somehow she found out on her own so can you really blame her for being a little salty about the whole situation 

she may be in denial or feel  as many parents do that youre just labeling yourself because its popular to do so or she may be just hurt that you didnt come to her when you had this revelation 

stop the passive aggressive crap that shows your immaturity and could actually reinforce your moms thinking that you just want a trendy label 

have a real honest down to earth talk with your mom 
stay calm and explain to her whats going on with you even if she gets excited or nasty or dismissive  hold your ground calmly 

she may not jump on board right away either but youre not making any progress as it is 

and when she agrees to your pronouns give her some leeway if she slips up  14 years is a long time to call you she her and now shes going to have to think before she addresses you every single time
honestly i would think a nanny would be a useless expense and its not cheap 

hes home all day anyway he can take care of the baby and does he not think the baby needs him 

it is inconceivable that this man is writing all day every day 
most days hes probably not doing any writing at all thats how the writing process works 

why does he not want to care and nurture his child  

go to the office someone in this marriage has  to sustain this family
just spend what you can easily afford on something that you think she would like 

dont forget that after the engagement theres a wedding and a honeymoon 

if you blow all your money on one ring you have to scrimp and save for the rest that comes after
yes you are crazy 

your bf and his friend actually asked to vacation at your deceased dads house  without you  

then when you rightly said no they change their trip conveniently to where you are also going to be vacationing  but youre all not going together  why is that

oh it gets better the friend not even your bf ask again to stay at your dads house oh but again youre not there but shes bringing her friend  

just tell them both to go to hell 
i do not believe you and bf are so in love that you have to bend over backward to appease not only him but his friend also 

and why do you think that  
because she stood up to some ah that made fun of your accent  

how about you just start standing up for yourself to ppl who make fun of you and to these two users
nta for not entertaining his ridiculousness 
its absurd that he would even ask you to give him advice on his relationship youre not a couples counselor 

do away with both of them like literally dont even pick up her calls or
texts 

they arent even your friends you know her because she is friends with your bfs cousin which at best make you acquaintances 

she picked him and wants to stay so let her deal with her own messed up life
nta

but i want to know how old frank is 

this is not your situation to manage 
and you dont know or even like this guy if rory and frank want to see each other they have to figure out a way 

every time she wants to see him youre gonna somehow get your parents to go visit family in queens  oh and youre just gonna conveniently being your best friend and then what disappear for a few hours to go see frank  
oh and her parents are strict about boys so add to this absurd scenario her parents finding out 

see how stupid this sounds 

really why cant you guys just find some nice boys where you live  
youre 15 youre supposed to be figuring out all this dating crap with other teens from school or a club or anywhere closer
and as per usual the revenge dress will fail because it will be ill fitting
the issue is not that you cant lose weight 
you dont have to lose weight 

the issue is

you know youre at a healthy weight but you want to lose more weight to be skinnier you need to explore why you feel the need to be even smaller than you are 

do you see the difference  

did you tell the therapist that you are not happy with how you look and that is the reason you want to lose weight have you explained the binging purging and excessive exercise 
if you did and their advice was to eat more veggies you need a diff therapist
your weight is perfectly fine you know this you acknowledge youre at a healthy weight 

do your parents know about your past  issues with your weight  if not now is a good time to tell them 
and if they do now is a good time to tell them 
if they dont make sure you see at the least your regular dr if not a therapist then tell a guidance counselor at school 

you need to get a handle on this now  before you do irreversible damage to your health
ok im looking at this a bit differently than the other 2 commenters because its not just her whose saying she regrets not being with others you said it too 

i think her coworker was totally out of line with his behaviors i cant even imagine what he was thinking so im not gonna comment on that thats a while diff issue 

you say that it was rocky at the beginning but its better and you love each other now  
i think you need to check in with your wife about that and also do a brutally honest assessment of your own feelings 

if yours was truly a loving partnership marriage there really should be no reason to need validation from others on either side 

your start was tough because maybe you didnt really know each other that well but after 7 years you both should know if this is your person or not 

it shouldnt be we stay together for the son or were just comfortable in our day to day or itll cause too much upheaval to split up or any other superficial excuse you could both come up with 

you both should be staying together because this is actually the person you want to be with if its not youre both just prolonging the inevitable 

not that i think 28 is old by any stretch but having wild times that you both think you missed out on just isnt going to be the same at 2830 as opposed to 2125 and having sex with other people just for the sake of having sex with other people is a really crappy reason 

its time for some real honest soul searching by both of you neither of you can try to spare the others feelings in this if its not working its not working

is she gonna tell all about her early life where her dear mother was thru her childhood all about what her dad has done for her the story about trevor or even better cheating on corey with h  

were gonna get her spin  from age 37 thru 41 

get out of here with this nonsense what publisher would agree to any of this knowing how neither one of them can actually deliver on what they promise
are you really saying that h would go back to his family and eliminate his brother and all 3 of his kids just so he  and his wife can take the throne  

i hate them too but thats just way no to crazy land
wth did i just read 

im gonna need to know what the argument was about that made you take a break for a week 

so without that some observations 

you seem to have a lot of control over him you read his messages and his journal and decide who he can talk too does he always do what you want him to 

and that crap about him having to break up with you  no put your big girl panties on and make a decision thats middle school level maturity 

you dont want a marriage you want a proposal and wedding so you can pretend you have some great love story that survived through all your  perceived struggles 

and your solution to this is to set an arbitrary date at which point if he doesnt want to get married you will leave  i think my eyes are stuck in the back of my head from that hard roll 

you two both have a lot of growing up to do and i think it should be done separately
you are a grown man why are you moaning to your parents about your job when you readily admit that you bore everyone about it theres only so much a person can take 

figure your shit out for everyones sake 

make up with your parents and get some help you sound insufferable
im sorry i dont understand this at all 

godparents where i come from are not expected to raise or even help raise the child 
its a religious thing for baptism i never expected anything from my kids godparents 

she is saying she expects you to be all in with this kid from day one then no id decline thats mom and dads job of course everyone needs some help occasionally so then its grandparents siblings and friends very occasionally 

how does she treat the godparents of her first child are they bending over backwards for this child and does she talk badly about them if they dont  

id tell her you just dont feel you will have the time and energy to help raise her child and in addition you feel very strongly that you plan on focusing on your child when you have them and arent going to worry about anyone elses household 

shes a selfish person and as you know a selfish friend this decision might finally get you free of her
think how much hurt youre setting yourself up for in the future 

people who love you do not tell you they dont love you talk shit to their family about you get an apt behind your back and seemingly try to get with their co worker 

he doesnt really want to be with you hes just too much of a coward to break up so he does everything he can do to try to get you to break up with him so hes not the bad guy 

give him what he wants
exactly how will it keep you busy and away from him  

is he expecting you to go outside to his car and itll take you a while to pick the lock with a bobbie pin  

locking your stuff away is a sure fire way for you to keep engaging with him 

why exactly are you with him he seems to treat you crappy
youre missing the barbells 

your practice mistakes and stories
nothing about this makes sense
they include you when youre single while some of them are attached but then start excluding you when you get attached 

if it was that their partners felt threatened cause youre the young chickie  no offense to you just how older sos would view it id think the partners would be glad you found your own man 

they tell you when they got a raise or new car is it possible they are a bit salty that you as the young newish one is making the same money as them and theyve been their longer it have more experience  obviously its not your problem but they have to take their angst out on someone 

you need to speak with the ones that you were friendly with and ask what the deal is thats the only way youre gonna figure out why the sudden cold shoulder
your partner recounted to you the horrible things you said and you dont remember saying them 

think about what you said is there any truth to it at all even a little 

you broke up once are you sure you
both agree those issues are resolved
think back was anything you said related to that time 

all this to say take some time and be brutally honest about if he is really the one you want to be with  

maybe this whole thing is pointing to a reevaluation
i always wondered if a meeting with both sets of parents and both kids and a school psychologist to mediate would be helpful 

get it all out in front of everyone why do you pick on or bully or throw things or whatever and no letting the bully not answer 

i think younger kids would probably stop the behavior but middle and high school is a toss up depending on what the parents of the bully are like 
trash parents make trash kids 

if that fails then yes my kid would be learning to fight  ill give you one chance but ill be dammed if my kid is gonna be fodder for some insecure bully
esh you both sound unorganized 

i dont mean to sound judgmental at all my first didnt sleep thru the night until maybe 9 months so i understand what youre going thru but 

why is your home always a mess 
two adults and a 6 mo old who doesnt even crawl yet never mind play with toys 

your wife didnt need to put together the high chair right that minute and how long did it take seems like it was hours 
you could have made supper while the baby sat in a playpen or a baby chair or just take the initiative and order something 

first babies are hard for the fact that youre tired youre figuring out a new normal and a new schedule 

put the baby in a baby seat or a swing or a playpen or whatever you use and go about doing what you need to do if youre cleaning the lr have them in the room with you and just chat away at them while you clean if youre making bottles bring them in the kitchen and do the same they will be fine if they fuss a bit its what they do 

as far as the formula im not even sure what your wife was upset about she had to tend to a crying baby while you went downstairs to make a bottle  maybe her job should be to make sure there are enough pre made bottles made to last thru the night
you can then clean and make them to last thru the day
nta

they are your assets and can go to whoever you want id think dan would know why he wasnt included 

if your son is old enough and has had a good relationship with his uncle before he cut off contact maybe one of your other sibs can give him dans number and your son can text him 

but be warned you dont speak to your dad your brother has turned against you do you really want your son conversing with someone who is going to talk bad about you  you dont know what dan is going to say or if your son is going to decide youre the bad guy   be careful what you wish for
this is the only answer 

people cannot be won in a fight 

if they dont want you accept it and move on
ywnbta

this person has accused you of despicable things and then went  oops sorry didnt mean to totally screw with your life  cause really im sure the whole school heard the accusation lets be friends again 
how does this person even have any friends left after what they did 

nope how could you ever trust this person ever again  
id stay as far away from this person as possible
as long as you find a dress that you absolutely love within your moms budget  and i am sure you can i would just tell mil that while you appreciate her offer you really want your mom to be the one to buy your dress its a mother daughter thing and that doesnt take away any good strong feelings toward her and you appreciate all the help she has offered for the wedding 

she should be able to understand that md bond and respect it 

also can i give 2 pieces of advice 

 plan your wedding for what you and fianc want his mom might want top tier everything or every option on the menu but figure out if these are things that you really want sometimes less really is more 

 go dress shopping with just your mom you will know which dress is yours its a feeling when you see yourself in it your dress shouldnt be decided by a committee too many opinions will cloud your judgement  ive watched too much say yes to the dress but i honestly believe this 

congratulations and dont stress about planning this should be a happy fun time
how long have you been dating 
have you guys even talked about what the future would look like once the baby is here were you planning on being a couple 


look i think its unreasonable that shed choose to spend tgiving with another guy is it just the two of them or is she going to his familys holiday since i would think you two were in a committed relationship but idk her situation are you working that day does she not have family close or friends she could spend it with  did you two even talk about what you were doing for that holiday 

her idea that two guys cant hang out alone is off the wall to begin with i dont even know how shed go right to must be gay 

you need to make some decisions
do you want to be with her
 do you just want to coparent and not be a couple

take today to decide and then contact her to tell her what you decided youre old enough to make these decisions about whats best for you 

either way id def get a paternity test and have everything go thru the courts especially since youre military and could be moved at any time protect yourself and your rights to your child
talk about division of chores but realize that at times things wont get done its ok if some chores like dusting or vacuuming dont get done on sat every single week itll keep 

just be flexible with almost everything youll eventually find a rhythm that will work for you both
i think theres more to this 

what did your friend mean about making better decisions about you the pregnancy the family friend 

what would make her jump to you are gay  unless your friend texted more than what you know 

really just let her go dont even try to contact her 

if you think its your child go thru the courts for paternity testing visitation and support dont even try to work this out with her youll be in for months of crazy
nta 

for all the reasons everyone else posted but also because as you stated youre not even sure if your d is telling the truth 

not yours or your d place to say anything

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

him having no one to hang out with isnt your problem 
he moved to a place he knew no one thats what happens 

you broke up when you were a junior in college youve moved on and its time he did too 

but you have to tell him or hell keep trying to force his way into your life
its not odd that he moved to your city but did he have a job lined up other friends or at least a reason other than he likes it 
hes free to live wherever he wants but it does seem like he moved to be closer to you and thats creepy 

heres the thing  you do not have to be friends or even talk to anyone you dont want to 

so if you dont want to talk to or be friends with the ex just tell him dont explain why this isnt a conversation this is you stating call him or text him  it make it short i dont want to talk to you anymore we are not friends goodbye then hang up and block him if you called
do you just let that talk to you that way or so you answer them back 

say it firmly and let them know in no uncertain terms that if they say anything else about your food you will not be back 

i realize theyre your parents but at this point it should be more of a reciprocal adult relationship not a parent child one they should treat you accordingly
the thing is you can never be absolutely certain that a partner is not going to cheat 

its only been 3 weeks the hurt over his cheating is in the forefront of your every thought your fear will be brought into any new relationship you have 

maybe you shouldnt be looking to date and give yourself time to just be 

eventually you will find someone who you want to be with and the fear you have now will be lessened to the point that you wont be in paranoid mode 

paranoid mode which is not at all healthy will only lead to you questioning everything your partner says everything they do and it will drive them away nobody wants to be looked at with constant suspicion for just living their life 

dont let this fear take over your life this too will pass
sorry no 

no one needs to placate their partner to the detriment of their own well being
your wife is insane 

divorce over an over cooked chicken sandwich  i cant even

is she frequently this absurd have there been other issues that she goes insane over if you dont cave in to

for me id just agree to the divorce to save myself from the crazy 

i am curious tho did she eat her whole sandwich how about the sister
yta

you certainly have a very high opinion of your family dont you most times when i meet someone like you i cant quite figure out why 

the fastest way to keep them together is to make them be apart 

and really you are a grown woman and you really are entertaining the thought that your 16 yo is going to be with this guy for the long term 

we all thought that at 16 and it never does  for the majority anyway 

leave them alone your d will decide if and when shes had enough
why doesnt he want your dads money  is there any bad blood there 
how does your dad treat your h older kids  

have you told your h that its almost insulting that he wont allow you to help shes as much your d  as his at this point 

and if its a trust then its your money not your dads no 


you can also go along with leah taking out the loans  she wont have to even start paying them back till 6 mo after she graduates at that time maybe your h will soften his stance and you can pay off the loans
i thought i heard read that your phone does listen to what you talk about but if you turn siri off it cant 

anybody know if its true
theres a lot of anxiousness when they leave the house in the beginning 
a lot of texts saying they arrived wherever 

then after a bit it becomes commonplace 

and youre actually glad you dont have to stay up late to pick them up from wherever they went
go on the trip 
memories with your friends will last a lifetime 

you cannot know what the future holds you or your gf will get to uni and the distance and freedom may cause one of you to want to explore what else is out there
why will it take him time to figure it out 
does he not read newspapers or magazines
does he not have friends who know whats going on with them 
hell if hes so close youd think hed try to keep up with whats being put out there 

i just cant figure out what the end game was supposed to be with this display 

the connection to diana can only go so far he may have a soft spot for harry but she has been instrumental in harrys misery 
elton should sing about that
im pretty sure this is illegal 

why would you even want to be married to someone under these circumstances  you will be putting your relationship life on hold for the foreseeable future are you really willing to not have a real relationship with someone you love 
it does not benefit your life in any way 

i say just tell her youre not comfortable with this and the answer is no
nope  theres nothing to discuss 

in my book this is a no coming back from break up thing
brooke sivendra royals series and the james thomas series is awesome 

anything by megan march 

christin  harber has a delta series thats pretty good
i could be wrong but even up until the baby shower i think the perception of h and by extension m was that they were all about championing causes 

i could see the clooneys being somewhat in that circle they have a justice foundation and have a charity geared toward sudan 

now why amal was invited was probably more to do with m wanting to appear to be friends and cash in on that status but i would think amal would be a little more busy to attend 

once they realized that these two were more interested in what can be done for themselves they knew they didnt want to be involved with them 

more a case of they came they saw and ditched them
thank you for the duomo tips
why do you have a problem with him hanging out with his friend 

im a little confused why he needs to be home when you get home 

its his day off he can enjoy it without you  just like you can do what you want on your day off 

you dont need to be attached at the hip
wait your bf was cheating on his ex for 6 months with you

thats why you dont trust him to be out of your site
i agree she did something related to the embassy that her uncle had a hand in arranging 

but bower says her dad paid for the  study programme and her sister says she wasnt employed by the embassy but was at a school attached to the embassy that arranged work study 

so really which is it

 did her dad pay for a program but what kind of program is only 56 weeks or did he fund her living arrangements 

 is the sister embellishing her recollection to make mm look even more like a fool 

that being said i certainly believe whatever she was doing there had nothing to do with any diplomatic relations whatsoever so basically just another lie to try and make herself seem more important which of course backfired
im not really seeing what it is that you need to work on 

you got a little lazy once you moved in and played games for longer than she would like   ok it happens she points it out and you adjust 

porn once and you have to tell your gf about it this is just silly if the urge strikes and you need a little help finishing why cant you do that does she have to control every orgasm you have  i dont even watch but have no issue with it

so shes stressed if she cant handle a relationship and regular life stress at the same time it kinda seems like she needs to do some work not you
nta

if shes as good a friend as you say then she would presumably already know your financial situation and she wouldnt be hurt by you not coming 

she may be disappointed that you cant be there but she shouldnt have any bad feelings toward you 

you need to get her on the phone and explain exactly what you told us here that you are upset you cant be there but its your last month of school and you just dont have the money to fly home in jan and then in feb when you have to leave the school 
ask if when you are home in feb can you celebrate her marriage see all the pics and get all the details of the day 

i hope shes understanding of your situation
its only been a few months and hes cheated already 

its like he didnt even try to be faithful 
is that what you want to have in the back of your mind all the time 

you guys were friends before maybe you should go back to that before you get in too deep 

and of course dont snoop if your gut is telling you something is off trust it and confront him
 nta at all 

it doesnt matter what bil thought he was doing he was way out of line 

did no one say anything to him at the time your sis your parents  not even your husband 

what exactly would you be apologizing for not sending him his own gold plated invite  ridiculous 

and wedding invites are always addressed to the couple not each individual 
your sis and her husband can go pound sand do you even really want them there
his reaction was way way over the top does he do that a lot 

please dont change anything on yourself because he doesnt like it 

today its eyebrows whats tomorrow going to be  weight boobs clothes 

youll get to a point where you wont even recognize yourself
nta

i would think your parents would want you to go to the competition because of all the hard work youve put into it 

your sisters graduation is important but its important to her and your parents mostly 
not that you arent happy and proud for her but its not like graduation will be ruined if youre not there 

send your sis a text explaining how much this competition means to you and that its not that youre not thrilled for her but this is a one time thing for you

signed
the sister who didnt go to her older sisters graduation 
it also depends on your age and life circumstances 

if you live at home and are a student and its just for spending money then sure why not 

if you are supporting yourself then you have to figure out how much of that salary you actually take home and decide if its enough to live on 

since you say its a bit above min wage then maybe its not the worst job to take even if its just to get some experience or if youre in a spot where you need a job any job
maybe one of these


this is an argument i would have 

hes known this for 2 months and being that you scheduled this so far in advance ill assume you had to give that much notice and cant just willy nilly change your days 

im getting the feeling that you placate him more often than not and he feels entitled to dictate what he wants
but did you tell him you were taking those days and then he decided to schedule all this private stuff 

thats the key here 

if he knew you were taking those days then hes wrong for scheduling on those same days i would tell him too bad he has to reschedule as your days were already set 

and no way i would be leaving my home for his stuff he can lock himself in a room away from where youre going to be
i didnt even know he was in baywatch 
so i went and looked him up 

hes slightly more attractive then than he is now but still does nothing for me 

sorry i know its just me 

but him now just always looks dirty like he needs a shower
so then tell him you cannot be with someone who is so irresponsible with money and break up 

tell him to call you when he has figured it out
jason mamoa 

def successful and fit but hes just ugly to me
yeah you should tell her but i wouldnt make a big thing out of it 

since youre the same age she might assume  youre gonna graduate at the same time better to know now if shes ok with this  and i cannot imagine why she wouldnt be 

youre just dating so i would think there would be a lot of conversations and do wonder why this hasnt come up before
i think we all figured he would announce  hes already come out to moan that arizona was  taken away from lake 

im more curious to see who in the near future is going to support him and what the rnc is going to say and do
sorry but i find it incredibly weird that you collect nudes like why

and then to trade them like one would trade baseball cards says to me that your attitude about the girls who post or sell nudes is that they are  lesser or maybe not be deserving of respect 

you think nothing if trading some other girls pics but god forbid you send your gfs pics anywhere shes better than that gmafb

youre not a horny teenage boy who cant control himself and needs to troll the internet for exciting pictures to get you off  youre supposed to be more mature than that but we know thats not the case dont we 

take a long hard think about that
the absolute fact is that if he wanted to be with you more than his gf he would have broken up with her as soon as he realized that 

he hasnt so he doesnt 

he talks a big game wants to respect your values and boundaries but always trying to push them so right there i dont trust anything he says 

do you think he wont do and say the things hes doing and saying to you if you guys are dating unlikely 

dont hang out solo with him make sure you have a trusted friend with you when you hang out with him who will stop you from doing anything stupid 

are you that hung up on him or is he just nice enough and is there at this moment
theres nothing to figure out 
you only know this guy a few months how close friends can you be 

this guy is still with his gf just the idea that he would even make a move on you shows you his character 

do you really want to be with a guy who while he has a gf is telling you hes not sure he wants to be with her while also trying to get with you

you really have no idea what is going on with his gf he can tell you anything he wants you have no idea how to verify it 

your idea is solid he breaks up with gf he takes some time to get over her while you two stay strictly platonic friends while you figure out if you want to be with him 

dont compromise your values for anyone if they cant wait they are not worthy
have you two ever even met in real life
ldr is just not for you 

its perfectly ok for you to tell him you cannot continue this relationship 

wish him well and get on with your life
then b has to tell c that they have no interest and to stop asking a to set it up
i feel like youre missing a fundamental basis of marriage which is trust you married this person so id like to think it was because you love and trust him 

apparently not because you really stretched his innocent question about tinder for his friend to thinking hes going to cheat 

seriously i cant even do the mental gymnastics it would take to get to that conclusion 

if he was going to cheat im positive he would not be asking you which dating app to use  

calm down crappy ridiculous arguments like the one you had will eventually be the death of your marriage if you continue these silly arguments 

you your husband and your marriage will be much happier if you just trust in the fact that you married each other in good faith with the idea that its forever 

stop looking for the end before its even had a chance to start
yta

in addition to being an absolute dirtbag and disgust me 

you obviously have no respect for your gf and only think of her in terms of what she can do for you 

i dont care how bad the construction industry is in your area you get another job any job you dont pimp out your gf 

i hope your friend tells and i hope she kicks you to the curb 
you dont deserve her
keep that money 

it may seem trivial to you but when you were little i am sure you brought joy to that woman by just spending time with her and sharing your amusing stories 
and she showed you how much she appreciated your company by gifting you in her will
you have to do what is best for you 
and this is not what you want anymore 
why would you  put what he wants above what you want  

first thing find a new job its ridiculous that your job is threatened just because you work for his relative 
get that straightened out first then work on an apt in the meantime save as much money as you can 

as far as being heartbroken will you really be  youre in an admittedly not healthy relationship its quite possible that you will feel relief as opposed to heartbreak 

will you miss him or will you miss the routine that you have been in  those are two very diff things 

ultimately you will be fine just the fact that you recognize that you two are not compatible is huge i would think most people would just keep going along to get along 

you know what you have to do just get it started life is too short to be stuck with someone just because
nta for not wanting to change your schedule 

but you really should have pointed out that you were hired for 25 travel and as of now it has been 100 travel 

if i was you i would call into the person that hired me and find out what the deal is 

if they want you to permanently work in the far place which it seems they do then you have to decide if this is a job you want to keep
 nta for being livid about him quitting before having a new job but

youre having another baby who is going to take care of this baby 
for the first one he did and you went to work maybe hes thinking it would be the same way but of course he should be working up until the baby is born to have a bit of a money cushion 

and have you thought about how youre going to handle 2 kids on your own  you will still have day care needs and someone to watch the other child before and after school and what do you do if you get deployed again  can you count on him to stay in your area after you send him packing or is he gonna run home and then youre literally in your own 

you guys need to talk about all of this your job his job your budget child care 

dont just go scorched earth until you have had this conversation
oh gosh didnt even realize that  
caught ever other typo i think except for the one that made a funny difference
im not sure if this is sarcastic or not 

and idk about magical rights but there are provisions for parents to give medical decision authorization to another person for either a limited time period or until the parent can be contacted 

if i take my childs friend with us on vacation their parents gives me the authorization to approve medical care if something were to happen to them while on vacation or until the parent can be contacted 

service members do the same thing if they are going to deployed or otherwise out of contact 

single people may do it if they have no family and are having a risky surgery better to designate someone who knows your wishes than leave it to an anonymous medical team
i think he has shown you enough of what he is really like im not convinced his drinking was to numb the pain of hurting anyone that would mean he actually had any empathy which he seems to be lacking toward you 
he was the one who blew up his life and family  and i wonder why he did that since that was left out you just happened to be there so he wasnt alone 

anyone who would treat you bad while your father is right there helping you move out is absolutely not the person i would ever give another chance to 

hes obviously some years older than you let him go there are more stable less baggage guys closer to your age that you can build a solid life with why are you even trying with this one  
this is a def case of parents know best
nta but your friend sure is 

she doesnt have to give you guardianship but she needs to sign something that says you have all right to make magical decisions for the baby if when she cannot be contacted 
id probably get it notarized while im at it 

so theres that now as far as holding her hostage  oh no shes got that backwards 

lets look at this  her parents want nothing to do with her when she gets pregnant then they say yeah come back into the fold but without the baby 

so your friend is just having it all isnt she  she gets to dump  yes i say dump because thats exactly what shes doing the baby on you whenever she feels like going home 

and then when shes good and ready to come back she resumes care of her child 

you are a saint for agreeing to any of this 

she needs to decide is she a mother to the child who she decided to keep full well knowing how her parents would react or is she going to pretend he doesnt exist to make her parents happy 
this baby isnt going to disappear you will be watching this boy for years to come because if her parents dont accept him now what makes you think that will ever change 

are you ok with that
honestly you guys were young when you got together its possible this has just run its course 

he might realize he misses you or he might enjoy being free of commitment and enjoy being single for the first time in his adult life 

i suggest you also enjoy being single and free  
hang out with friends find ways to be ok with being single 

you shouldnt be of a mindset that this is the only guy for you most of us have felt that way but its rarely true
spend less than you make cut out any expenses you dont absolutely need and invest the leftover 
put it in a mutual fund not individual stocks 

it may seem like such a small amount to invest but give it time once you start to see even a small increase in value it will spur you to keep at it 

once you are comfortable with the amount you can put away each month have that amount auto deposited each month from your paycheck and you wont even miss it 

it may be a slow journey but it will be worth it
girl seriously you are a fool 

love is blind maybe but deaf dumb and stupid  no 

you moved to be with an absolute loser who cant support himself never mind helping to support a kid 

what is it about him that you cant see he is using you  

i give him credit for being there for the child if hes the only dad the child ever knew but at the same time hes not really is he  

youre the one supporting him and the child 

the exs finances have absolutely nothing to do with anything these two will figure out what they need to do about the child without any help from you stop being their atm and if they dont thats their problem 

have you ever figured out how much he is really contributing to the household you two share  

wake up and get out
heres an article showing their mortgage payment 
according to this their mortgage is 95 million with a monthly payment of 40000


youre still in school so there is nothing wrong with living home 

why cant she come over and hang out in your room or you can go to hers 
you can watch movies and cuddle 
no need to always be going out somewhere 

im sure she is well aware of why you live at home and why you dont have unlimited money and she still wants to hang out so dont stress so much
could be 2 reasons

someone on govt assistance might be easier to take advantage of since donors are paid 

or

the payments to a donor may make them ineligible to continue on assistance
its only been a few months and even though you talk a lot its hard to really get to know a person that way 

dont you feel that there are just some things that dont translate well over the phone  how does a person act in social settings how do they talk to their family friends and even their child are they messy or neat do they have any odd quirks that def would not mesh with your life 

and more importantly will they and their child or you and your child get along with both other people  its not enough that you like her kid so far but what if she resents moving and leaving everything she knows and comes to resent you or your son what if your son resents having strangers move in  

my advice keep doing what youre doing for a few more months then bring your son to meet them then talk to your son and have an honest conversation with him and she should have one with her kid how do they feel  if theyre ok so far have them come to you and have the same convo again 

im guessing both kids are relatively young so it is either going to be easier cause they arent as aware or harder cause to the kids you and her are their while world and they wont take well with sharing their parent 

just some things to think about but please please do not upheave either child unless everyone especially the kids are ok with it put your kids feelings before your own
did you really not realize that marrying someone after 2 weeks wasnt going to work 

seriously if you dont mind answering 

id love to know what was going thru your head at the time as it seems a lot of military have these quick marriages 
did no one try to talk you out if it
so its ok that your d is getting sloppy two hundred seconds because he can take care of her and give you grand babies you realize a 35 yo man who is still able to attract a 19 yo has been around the block more times than you could probably count 

but your oh so precious s is so special that he cant saddle himself with a woman who may have had previous lovers what if she can provvide for him  you do realize she can still have babies dont you 

hypocritical much
i found this



its a free text crisis service 
they are trained professionals 

maybe try them check them out
go to someone at your school guidance counselor teacher there is usually someone in every school who is there for the students 

if that fails walk into a hospital and tell them you need to talk to a mental health worker 

best of luck to you
i dont know about your scenario but if a parent was willing to do that why dont they just add your car onto their policy and you pay whatever the increase would be to your parents when the bill comes in it might be cheaper that way
nta 
but maybe she has some weird aversion to doing the dishes like everyone has their one household thing that they hate doing 
ask her then you can swap out a different chore that she can do instead of the dishes you do dishes and she does one that you currently do 

i do wonder tho why you even while working full time were doing all of the household chores while she was working part time 

have  you guys talked about the changes that were going to take place since youve been sick does she feel that since shes working full time she doesnt have to do anything else you know like you were doing for however long 

seems like this marriage has been unequal from the get go 

im sorry you got so sick i hope you get well enough to go back to your job it must feel awful especially being in the health fuel that the thing that was supposed to help protect you actually harmed you
nta for trying 

your bro seems to resent your mom because of the divorce he needs to know if he doesnt already that it was your dad who forced the divorce your mom was not willing to just forgive and forget the affair so him being mad at mom is not sensible make sure there isnt more to it than that 

now if youre still gonna talk to mom you need to let her know that bro is not a baby and hes also not a very affectionate person its nothing personal to her its just the way he is  even if it is just toward her 
hes a teen boy the last thing he wants is to hug his mommy if she needs affection that badly she should find a boyfriend 

i do agree they both that they both need therapy
what could employees of a sandwich shop possibly divulge  mayo or mustard  

i could see it not wanting to be known where they honeymooned but thats a 2 week nda at most 

these two are so over the top its absurd
im not sure you were being selfish 

you thought of her and what she was feeling and what would be better for her instead of clinging to her because you need her as you go through a really serious time in your life 

are you sure you broke up with her because you want to be with someone who is all in for you  that would be selfish or did you do it because somewhere in your mind you know that its unfair to ask her to be your nurse maid support person and girlfriend yet again  that would be selfless 

it might seem like you made the decision for her but she probably would not have made this decision on her own how do you leave the person you love when they are literally fighting for their life the guilt would be astounding 

i wish you a full recovery and a wonderful life
its not hate its disappointment in you and the friend 

you have been in a committed relationship for 2 years with a guy who obviously trusts you  and his friend and both of you broke that trust and for what a couple minutes of funtime 

whats best for your baby is that it is recognized by its real father so that it can grow up knowing where they came from whether that father wants to be a part of their life or not 

you cant decide paternity based on who is in a better position to raise the child or who you would rather be with 
there are multiple stories on reddit where kids found out who there real dad was later in life and their whole world was blown up do you think thats good for your child 

you know your bf best how do you think hes going to react when he finds out the whole story  maybe he wont care and will stay and raise the child with you maybe hell break up with you but either way he needs to know 

saying nothing is not the solution 
secrets will come out at some point
there is no other advice to give you have to be an adult and fess up 

he should be able to decide if he wants to stay with a gf who cheated and also whether he wants to stay friends with the guy who would sleep with his gf 


and really his friend on a trip where the bf was there  how did that even happen where was bf when you were sleeping with his friend 3 times 

i hope its the friends baby and the bf breaks up with you and dumps his friend 

you and the friend deserve each other
but how did she react when you pointed out you thought you werent doing gifts since she got you nothing

its very telling if she expects you to be giving to her and she has no obligation to reciprocate 

if she is mad then thats her problem not yours shell get over it 

but have the holiday gift talk soon save yourself any future grief
usually id say its pretty standard to get and give your so a bday gift 

but you two are young do you guys even have disposable income to be able to afford gifts  

being that your bday is before hers there should have been a simple conversation about gifts either a price limit or an agreement to not exchange at all 

heres a thought instead of gifts agree to do something for both of your bdays supper and a movie an experience you both want to do etc 

this way youre both spending the same amount of money and nobody can get their feelings hurt over something pretty trivial 

you best have this conversation before the holidays come around 

i am curious did you say to her that she didnt get you anything so you just assumed you werent exchanging gifts this year  what was her reply
are you saying that you and your partner are still willing to hang out with them but you just want her inappropriate behavior acknowledged

so does that mean the rest of the friend group is not willing as in does not want to hang out with them at all  

if this is the case then it is eric and amy that have lost all their friends not just you and partner
if you watch tv while on the couch you could get up and move during every commercial walk in place walk around the house use empty gallon milk jugs refilled with water and use as barbells its not much but it makes me feel like im doing something 
you can also buy one of those foot pedal things to do while you sit there 

youd have to be watching regular tv tho so if not set a timer and do it every 10 minutes for a minute
were there any people dancing 

did the b  g even dance to italian rap maybe they like it if they were club people maybe they wanted it that way 
i agree it does sound awful tho even if i was a club person id want to dance to something i know
nta
mistakes happen but you still paid for something that you didnt get 

youre in the group chat so you should have just answered his message to everyone that you didnt realize that you didnt actually order but still paid thinking you did order and just wanted to figure out why there wasnt one for you 

and everyone didnt need to know anything about what happened why would they 
im sure you talk to some other team members and would have mentioned to them what happened you know like normal people do and the committee could care less about uniform ordering im sure
thats why i said to explain what went on with your bro so that your parents dont have a negative idea about you which is ridiculous anyway they raised you they know who you are and what youre like why would they ignore what they see and know just because their other kid says so  

look you are probably still in school so while its great that you are interested in learning computer stuff it cannot be the only thing you do besides school explain to your parents that all learning and studying is just as unhealthy as all gaming you need balance
just tell your parents what really happened what he said you said and explain it to them clear the air so they stop thinking of you as the problem child 

you get 50 every time you help him cant you buy your own graphics card
your partner is not there to make you happy fulfill all your hopes and dreams and jump at your every whim 

stop sweating the small stuff work out the big things 

small  its ok if your so didnt vacuum on tuesday like they said they would itll get done at some point 

big stayed out all night and you had no idea where they were 

treat each other like you want to be treated in return its a partnership not a competition of who is the better person
after what he said about the dishes i wouldnt wash another one ever again fuck him  

know your place you know your place and it isnt with this ah 
stop this behavior  oh yeah im stopping everything with you  

you have a job and an apt ready to go take the leap whats the absolute worst that could happen  

you need to change your mindset from scared to mad mad enough that you just say fuck it and fuck him call today and make sure you can get that apt then when he leaves for work tomorrow pack your stuff and leave 

you can leave a note but dont explain anything just say im not coming back and dont contact me then block him and get on with your life 

you can do this you did it before him and youll do it after him
yes whatever this event is for its most likely nothing tw and her husband have done anything for  because

they dont do anything 

so id ask what have you done for  insert event name  

and watch her try to word salad her way out of answering and then counter her answer and around and around we go until then just saying so basically you do nothing for anyone got it
i agree its not any of the parents fault 
the kid is responsible for their actions and knows by this age right from wrong 

has the child acknowledged what they did wrong and what was the reasoning for it 

punishment should fit you took money so you earn it back to pay it back 
weekend chores around the house 
1200 is a lot of money what did they do with it 

lying is tough to punish because its more a trust issue  ie i cant trust what you say to be true idk what they lied about so these are example

maybe once they are allowed back out with friends you make sure they can be tracked you confirm with other parents that who and where they are going is true 
if schoolwork is not being done then you arrange with the school to be informed of all assignments and you have them show you the work 

things of that nature until you can be relatively sure the lying has stopped or at least not for the big things cause the mundane stuff doesnt really matter in the scheme of things 

youve been advocating trying to help this child for a long time to no avail maybe now their parents will listen
as the stepmom id be asking the kids dad what he was going to do about his wayward kid

id also ask the dad to try and figure out why said child is doing these things you cant just blindly punish if you dont know whats going on with the kid 

oh and id also lock up anything of mine that has any value to it
this 

i can sort if understand the idea that if harry comes she has to also as much as i think its ridiculous 

but lets look at them as a regular family there are some where ones spouse is not welcome to family things 

its no secret the rf has no good will left toward mm so while it may cause a bit of a stir that hed be going and not her shell be the one to save face and put out a statement saying she declined to go so at least one parent could spend archies bday with him or some other bull that makes her look not as left out
ok thats odd then 
you need to ask him to explain what his aversion to meeting these people is
how is he supposed to get to know them if he doesnt hang out with them 

his logic is flawed there must be another reason does he have any other friends except you  is he shy or have social anxiety  if this is the case maybe have him meet one person for a very short time and then another person until hes somewhat comfortable with hanging out with these people

the problem i see you having is that this person it seems is withholding work related things from you because you dont agree with her opinion of mm 

if you outrank her then its time for a chat  she needs to know that regardless of her feelings about you based on your feelings of this topic the idea of withholding work related information is not acceptable and it needs to stop now 

you may want to wait to see if it happens again give her the benefit of the doubt but if it happens again then its time to take action 

it kind of sucks that shes giving you attitude and you might want to mention that too usually adults can be civil even if we disagree and this is such an insignificant thing for her to be so invested in
but she really doesnt have to let him go does she 
he can just file and move out or share the house till its done 

its not like they both have to agree to a divorce 

now she may try to make his life a living hell try to smear him with whatever lies or truths she can get out there but after a while who is going to want to listen to her same old same old 

and maybe the rf will leak some of the more unsavory things they know about her to ruin her credibility even more
yeah i wont read them in the hopes the dm will stop writing about these two 

i just come here to see whats new 
so thank you everyone
it seems to me that he doesnt even have a communication style 

whats with the ignoring you nope you need to say out loud that you will not stand by and be ignored 

you ask for a hug and kiss and he just moves you aside with no explanation at all  were you offended by this did you voice that to him and he did what said nothing  and then continued to ignore you hours and days later  

why are you still there  he clearly doesnt have any problem not talking to you so give him no one to talk to 

theres a lot more going on than a diff of communication styles
we are one of the few that actually watched and liked suits 

that said even as we watched her character was the one we always said we didnt like she added nothing to the story lines we watched for the scheming of the rest of the shows characters
i think we should all print this article and mail it to harry 

you know in case he missed reading it
those are really cute
do i think its a big deal that he played longer than an hour no not really i am not a gamer at all but i can understand the idea that sometimes you cannot just put a time limit on gaming things happen in a game teams are set up and you cant just drop out etc 

and your post made it seem as if he has been prioritizing you over his gaming for the past few months which to you is great but it probably really bothered him but he was trying to keep the peace with you that is not sustainable for any relationship with any hobby or outside interest 

i think you are more upset that his hobby is gaming if his hobby was long distance cycling would you be as upset that he goes on hours long rides every day probably not because youd see that as a good hobby as opposed to gaming which i suspect you see as a bad or childish hobby but thats not for you to decide for someone else 

and sorry but your family was quite frankly absolutely in the wrong adults dont admonish other adults for their likes and dislikes we accept that people are individuals and will like what they like if i was him i wouldnt want to stay involved with you knowing how your family was so dismissive and rude 

let him be to find someone who doesnt mind his hobby or who will actively participate with him in it 
youre not the one for him
i thought the same thing 

he wants to get you a ps5 so that he can also play on it 

id let him know directly that you want a gaming laptop for your birthday 

you can buy the ps 5 together as a joint holiday gift to each other
as far as i can see your bf will do something nice for you but then needs you to do something nice for him like tit  for tat and you will do that just to make him happy yikes 

this guy wouldnt do all the dishes just his  in his mind half who does that in what world does this seem like a normal thing to do and to boot you were sick  

and then he proceeded to only do his half of the chores  uh uh no way is this ok 

seriously i dont care how long you are together he sounds like a nightmare to be with 

ill bet he never does anything for you just for the sake of doing something to make you happy but you do that for him 

this is a seriously unbalanced relationship and youre on the losing side  ask yourself why you want to be with this guy what is he adding to your life
theres a carnival ship that leaves port canaveral on sept 21  2023 ending in barcelona on oct 4

then on oct 28 theres a trans back from rome to tampa  nov 12 

so you can have 24 days to bop around europe and then sail back to the us 

all diff airports  and i have no idea where youre starting from but it might be something to look about
i cant imagine she was fired because its not like she wrote the article in a vacuum 
someone higher up would have had to see the finished article and approve it for publication 
so if allyson gets put on unpaid leave the approvee would get worse 
anyone know if someone higher up at the cut is also gone
do we think harry will even attempt to defend himself and expose what shes really like  
or is he gonna be just as spineless as he is now
nta

your bros relationship may not be an actual sugar baby one but are you afraid that maybe she likes him just a little bit more since he is comfortable 

im sure she likes him dont get me wrong but does she also have a career is she established in her own right 
maybe thats why youre bothered by the comments somewhere you feel shes not kidding
i dont know if this is something you can come to as middle ground 

she has said what she needs is to be left alone to study you have to be able to do just that  leave her alone when she says she needs to study there is no middle ground there 

if your usual way of trying to be supportive is to constantly doing something for your partner then youre going to have to figure out how to not do something and reassure yourself that this is what she wants 

its going to be a long lot of years if you cant come to terms with this 

you might need to find something to do all the days shes busy youre a music major so do music  play learn a new instrument compose whatever it is that youre wanting to make as your career 

when you two are together just enjoy the time together whatever you do
