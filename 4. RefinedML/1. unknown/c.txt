if you are thinking of selling it in the next year or two it isnt likely worth building an adu if you plan to rent it out for the next 710 years then it likely is
 and the last time i lived in an apartment was several years ago in undergrad

worth reaching out to the property manager or landlord there and seeing if they have a record of you paying rent on time and leaving the place in ok condition so you can use them as a referral 

otherwise look for a room to rent initially in your new town and once youve worked for 6 months to a year you will have enough pay stubs to start looking for your own place plus a local reference you can see if anyone rents specifically to grad students if it is a college town that will get you a quieter type of home
your bf isnt helping his friend hes being a white knight savior

she needs clinical help which he cant provide thats great you set a reasonable and totally logical boundary down no she cannot live with both of you and that he complied but i dont really see this getting better as a whole unless he can come to terms with the part he plays in her addiction cycle codependent rescuer

if he was a real friend hed be setting clear boundaries she needs longterm mental health care trauma therapy and addiction recovery likely in long term clean and sober living

none of these he can actually provide she prefers going to him because it keeps someone in her life and allows her to continue making the crap choices that her addiction follows he likes her coming to him because being someones rock makes him feel good about himself

ask him to attend alanon with you and see if he is willing its got issues but a lot of this kind of codependent bs  cycles are addressed there
you put down 20k in earnest money eeek

your father is correct on this one and in a weird way so is your so

you are not married he so is not contributing to the down payment  he is not on the mortgage his loans do make him a liability for all intents  purposes it is not his house so it makes sense his contribution should be viewed as rent and he should sign papers that he has no claim on the home edit in case of break up

if you and your dad cant really make that work with him viewed solely as a tenant then youve bought too much house
whispy willie
thats something i wonder about the entirety of the maga cultist i am talking about the diehards that later got into qanon  trumpism filled a social void in their lives 

especially the ones that used to travel around going to his rallies compulsively like the hateful dead for 65 and up its like the people who were completely lost after jerry garcia died
ah i misunderstood that you are the tenant

you are 100 in the right that is a shite fix and it will cause water damage down the road 

reword your email to sound professional you can still demand a proper fix and point out that you are paying market rent and have a right to expect market standards to be met in the apartment also point out the issues with longterm water damage and get what you want better if you first approach professionally 

escalate only after you get rebuffed dont come in swinging
if you dont have one lined up get a proper property manager you mention in the comments you are out of state  the other person who could go and check wont be back for a week you state he didnt return the keys but theres nobody there to see if the keys are there in an empty apartment if the place is truly clean or trashed 

does the previous lease state where the 30 days notice should go and was their a former contact he may have used 

if i just inherited a multiunit complex id want to get everyone on the same page know whats in all the leases plus avoid headaches thats too difficult to do out of state without a manager
its weird but it is always so much easier to get a job when you have a job its like hiring committees are more invested in wooing those that would be harder to snag and hate actual availability

you didnt ask for suggestions but a volunteer commitment once or twice a week outside of your home is helpful to regain that im a busy important person feeling that goes to help in interviews it also helps with the hopelessuseless feelings of unemployment and its also not a bad way to network a bit 

you mention wanting to change to a more communitybased field which means volunteering in something that is nearish to what interests you could really pay off
i pay for takeout and groceries

you pay for his meat products all groceries and you both split the cost of takeout

hes got it made no wonder hes refusing to learn to cook simple meals it would mean hed next have to learn how to grocery shop and pay for his own food

id go with an ultimatum any adult can watch youtube videos and learn how to prepare a few simple meals also stop making him special meat stuff he can go figure out the primal esoteric knowledge of meat  hot coalsfire  food
plus you have good food
haha thats my other joke that im coldblooded and need to sit on a sunny rock to recharge like a lizard
i hate to tell you but your best bet as an israeli is getting through service getting a topnotch engineering or tech degree and getting out via a work visa otherwise it is likely a ton of  and trying to go to college elsewhere but i have no clue what the illegalities are of leaving before serving 

isnt there a pacifist clause where you can do your military time in the idf in the kitchen or nonactive service
i found some relief when i got really really into lighting in general turns out halogen bulbs and fluorescents what a lot of the older models of sun lamps were made from come with whats called higher cri they duplicate color that noon sun would show better leds just have this weird synthetic feel to me i know delicate snowflake that i am

dark houses with old lighting are my bane i built a bunch of lights using halogen bulbs currently no longer available in the us but i bought a bunch on ebay and flooded my home with light yes that helped a great bit

the sit in front of this light box for 1020 minutes every morning and youll feel better solution never worked for me not saying they dont work just not in my case 

as others mentioned also getting your vit d levels checked and taking a vit d supplement can also help with the depression who knows if this is placebo but iron and b12 also helped me a bit too as i run anemic 

i still say nothing hits like sitting in a room filled with natural sunlight nothing
want to do tradesies i kid sort of grass always greener

higher wages come with their own issues especially in higher costofliving areas where the work expectations are also intense i want it now and i want it done right is great when you are on the receiving end but sucks when you have adhd and are meant to be delivering it i can do it right or i can do it now but i cant do both
first off you are alive they are alive and cars are replaceable thats all actually very good stuff

i have developed over years of dissociative tendencies to form what i call life or death mindfulness do i suck in general at the concept of mindfulness yes do i hate meditation and other techniques mindfulness proponents swear are the secret keys to a better life sure do but 

life or death mindfulness goes like this is my current action capable of major injury to life or limb for me or someone else if yes hey brain this action is all that matters right now 

cooking or any flammable task driving carrying a knife  climbing ladders  even walking down steep stairs or hiking rickety areas i can remind myself now that i do have to be present for this action if not for me then for others i still have accidents every so many years especially when i fall out of the practice usually prior to those accidents i can look back and note there was an increase in dissociating or high levels of stress so this is in no way a guaranteed process its an improvement only those accidents however set me up to be better for the next several years after one car accident and a few broken bones have gotten me to stay relatively alive  not killing anyone else for several decades on earth
i used to teach english i will die on the hill that local dialects are just as good as formal english for communicating if not better because they add life  nuance to language 

now for writing in formal settings it is always to the advantage of someone to learn basic grammar plus acceptable language and writing skills mainly because the world is filled with snobs like your girlfriend who will judge the crap out of you doesnt mean they are right just because there are many of them 

anyhoo you deserve to be with someone who sees you as worthy for your personal qualities not classist ideals i would bring it up she should know this hurts you and it is disrespectful to be badmouthing you to others or act ashamed of a partner badmouthing is very different than venting
going from a year lease to monthtomonth is common it makes your life somewhat easier ifwhen you want to move

as for the landlord considering selling it is not rude the next time you interact to ask him or her if they are looking to sell in the near future they only owe you a certain number of days notice 30 or 60 but its not offensive to casually inquire if they know what their longterm plans for the place are
i have always joked i have an oldschool camera aperture in my brain that is constantly seeking more light dark homes dark climates i get severe sad and am less productive 

ive bought the sun lamps taken vit d but nothing works like actual exposure to real sunlight 

one day i hope to move to the mediterranean will i be more productive i doubt it but my daily mood will be fantastic
i dont know why people are reading adhd into it in it he specifically says she was diagnosed at one point in childhood with autism he uses the word aspergers and depressed since childhood but never addressed it  she doesnt speak with her family its pretty easy to presume chaotic or traumatic childhood autism since thats the given diagnosis and lifelong depression from both of those sure she can have both but the post indicates a severely depressed person to me with possible autism more than adhd 

we have no idea whats really going on in anyones marriage if shes refusing therapy then thats one thing if no one has ever tried to get her help including him thats a totally different thing 

the term weaponized incompetence hurts when you are genuinely doing everything in your damn power to get through the day but some people also truly give up having depression adhd or autism means you deserve support and help only we do have to at some point in life meet people halfway and get outside help not rely on a single friend parent or spouse as your only source of caretaking or support
you had a terrible realtor if the inspection contingency was not waived then no need to forfeit your earnest money also you 100 made the right choice manufactured homes are the one area where repairs often cost more than the value the original building materials are worth and once water is in walls for a long time you are looking at mold conditions
your daughter is 100 correct

also as long as you are talking to her every night then you arent really seeing who else is out there that is actually available and actually interested in dating you 

id go so far as to guess you might be in love with her because shes not available  it is a convenient way for you to feel like you have somebody while not risking a real relationship 

go really date some women who want to be dating and are officially single
yeah that agent wants to buy it or a friend of his wants it or he wants to do a quick sale without having to market it for them unless it is in really poor condition theres no benefit for them to have fewer eyes on the house 

if they havent signed a seller agreement with him thats so shady that i would cut him loose
a properly wired habitable unit should be able to handle a coffee maker and microwave or have the right amount of outlets on separate breakers thats not extreme use
its called pharmacogenomic testing  i linked you to a mayo clinic page describing the process op said he was taking effexor its primarily used for antidepressants and i know it has been used somewhat for adhd meds it doesnt say what meds will work but narrows down metabolizing issues to let a psychiatrist at least see what is more likely to work better  have fewer side effect issues
any words of advice for how i might respond

since hes gone unilateral in his decisionmaking  putting his foot down you go unilateral in yours i will be quitting the restaurant and continuing to expand my business you can either support me or we can talk with lawyers

a partnership consists of compromises and two people supporting each other youve compromised for years now he wont do either in return also waitressing has a shelf life its physically exhausting work not that 35 is old by any means but a lifetime career of being a waitress is asking for physical impairments as you get into your 40s ask me how i know
if you are priced below market you will get extra attention at market not so much zillow i believe has a system where renters can fill out a form once and then blanket apply to as many apartments as they want so it is a noharmnofoul situation for people to apply to as many places as theyd like 

clearly list your requirements in the post but expect to have applicants ignore the requirements by those same measures just ignore any applicants who dont qualify
pretty sure he had to fork over your social security number to do this and any money hes made off of you would have been issued 1099 reports to the irs as you were falsely made an independent contractor

you can report this for identity theft possibly tax fraud quite frankly thats i would do 

or you can speak to him that you need every piece of paper on this your name removed from the whole shindig or you will be reporting him he wont want to do that because it will take away his downline hes created but you need to get this done asap 

id also temporarily freeze my credit get a credit report and make sure he hasnt opened any lines of credit for himself in your name 

sorry your dad is sleazy
i get why people feel rejected by others but the truth is what causes you to be rejected by someone has nothing intrinsically to do with you

it has to do with their projection onto you and the combination both of you make together in each other

you have no idea if both women are the love of his sexytime life paid escorts after he went full mra if his life is filled with nostrings sex fests or lonely at his core maybe he discovered viagra maybe he dropped acid and had an epiphany or maybe its all false surface level changes we never know what truly is happening behind closed doors 

married now and ive got two children and wouldnt trade them or my wonderful husband for the world

then put your money where your mouth is do not contact plan something wonderful to do with your family and enjoy  appreciate the life you do have not the past one that is no longer there

if you are still ruminating on this months from now get therapy
my friend is the only person i allow to come over when it looks this way and she knows that 

except  you were asking a favor for another issue you have beeping smoke alarm so i am pretty sure under the emergency circumstances she prioritized helping you in a way most convenient for her 

you could have texted hey place is a mess can you just run up and help me while he waits in the car

friend is not a mind reader she helped you the best she was able i think its best for you to be grateful you have a friend who comes over to help and let the rest go with the intent to communicate with better clarity next time
i like it its one of those got to do the whole place or paint it over the disjointed feeling is in part that you havent completed it yet 

probably if you painted the cabinets on the vanity and the little side cabinet in the same taupe once youre done or painted them both the same white that would help the main clash right now is that each cabinet is different  you have the quartz countertop to contend with  wall design
 i feel like hes completely lost interest in me 

i am willing to bet if you got wife 13 into a room together theyd all have a similar tale to tell moves quickly loving and present gets married loses all interest

should i make a last ditch effort and pay for marriage counseling

you can certainly broach it but if his response is that you should pay for it in its entirety instead of splitting the cost that tells you how much effort he will put in to the work needed to salvage things

it just sounds like you married a serial monogamist who is in love with love but not in love with actual people
i love old vintage salton sea postcards it absolutely was once was a charming vacation destination instead of a manmade cancer cluster and algae bloom mess
we have been seeing a counselor for nearly a year

i am a big believer in marriage counseling but sometimes counseling is helpful to get people to the point of realizing whats broken isnt getting fixed and walking away as amicably as possible 

what is it you are looking for when you complete a task a thank you you could tell her you need to hear some appreciation criticisms  commentary are fine you missed a spot but they are heard better after a positive reaffirming statement thank you so much for your hard work theres a corner that needs some help ill fix it etc etc and the information hits differently tone goes a long way

if this is someplace youve both been before and it keeps happening anyway even after honest communication about both your needs you may be getting your answer
question have you looked at what current homes in your area comps in okay condition are going for

now that you know the varying issues on the home you will legally have to disclose those to new buyers markets are slowing in some areas where mortgage rates are impacting if its still in fixer upper status  no one waves inspections it may be a tough sell unless it is priced below comps
yeah sewer lining feels like one of those bs things a yearly roter rooter does the same or better to just keep roots out of your line and move on unless part of the entire sewage system has collapsed
on one hand its only been 4 months some people take longer to integrate a partner into their family

on the other hand sounds like his family are in his daily life and hes locking you in a bedroom to keep you from his dad wtf

just be blunt and honest it really feels at this point like you want to keep me away from your family  i feel like you are ashamed of me given you are deeply tied to family  your behavior around this i dont see us going anywhere longterm can you confirm this or explain whats going on for you
sell it to carvana process is quick and pay off what you owe
salton sea is likely beyond repair its a much younger lake from the early 1900s colorado river run off into a sink and it will never see those levels again in southern california everyone reliant on the colorado river including new mexico and arizona are likely going to run out of access 

its also the most polluted lake in california i think with problematic saline levels  about 100 years of chemical runoff from all the farms down there once that dried up as it lost water levels over the past few decades even the air makes people sick rip
ask your doctor to do genetic testing for meds it will give you both an idea of how quickly you metabolize various medications  that may help point you both in the right direction
why dont you try solo therapy first so you can maybe get to the root of what it is thats upsetting you about him
yup
the longer you look at listings the better you get at seeing the photoshop and computer mockups 

whole house glows with a bright white light yet theres no sun spots from the window falling shadows andor overhead lights are on its a dark place and they just amped the photo brightness

every room gets weird and elongated towards the front stretch filter feature that can make a twin bed look like a warped full or a toilet bowl thats super long

computer simulation ones nothing in real life sits with those lines and usually the shadows have a funky feel to them mostly because there is zero light source to even indicate where theyd come from but also the furniture always seems a little like its hovering in space
theyre offering to pay for part of an overall improvement on your place the issue between current fixtures and recessed can be that normal ceiling overheads can leave a place feeling dark depending on how much light it gets during the day so its a longterm improvement for the apartment 

id be inclined to keep a good tenant who wants to make improvements over the unit  is taking care of it happy especially if costs of the improvement are reasonable and you already have a 3 year history but thats me
i mean i do does it work nah but feels good
location dependent of course but if we ever got even close to 2019 wed still be in crazy town but a moderately acceptable version of crazy town

warningprawit appears that you are using praw in an asynchronous environment
it is strongly recommended to use async praw 
see  for more info

the people stating ignore them i tend to disagree its the dog shit theory of coping if theres a neighborhood dog whose owner lets them poop right in the middle of your front yard and you leave it there  ignore it all you get is more dog owners letting their dogs poop next to it 

your best bet is a large peaceful counterprotest next time lots of people who come out to equally display their right to freedom of speech in a happy fun way you can absolutely rid your town of nazis by overwhelming them with a large pleasant antinazi rally  were talking w baked goods and music these little groups go away from areas that push back but intimidate in numbers not aggressive behaviors

the next worse thing after the ignore method however is to have a small volatile counterprotest that acts antagonistic or allows for fights to break out that tends to give them what they really really want attention and victim status
herpes is a disclosebeforesex thing but if this was your first time having sex together then it sounds like you were both getting into it to the point of no protection no discussion so you have some culpability here in not being responsible either then again the fact that she didnt disclose after until you brought an issue up is nooooot great 

cant say what to do in this situation but now you have a wonderful experience to remind you that 

1 always use protection until a longer discussion on birth control exclusivity and stds has happened 

2 always have a talk prior to sex the first time birth control expectations stds etc 

you are in your 30s well time enough to be an adult about this kind of stuff
self esteem letting your children feel good about what they can do not completely praising for every poop they make but valuing them as capable little individuals i was great at art as a kid and all i heard was how i was good at it but cant make a living that way insert later money issues and charging my worth to overcome let children explore talents they enjoy without bringing up careers to begin with  does your kid love trains let them explore that in childhood without talking about how they will become civil engineers

allowing them some facets of agency in their lives they can say no or negotiate reasonably around expectations again not handing them total control of their lives but incremental and developmentally appropriate attempts at independence and allowing them to fail or succeed on their own as they get older

open door policy they can always come talk to you about something or someone who is bothering them without fear of being punished or getting in trouble

i think there is a concept of good enough parenting youll mess up on a lot of stuff but theres a foundation of trust between the parent and child versus gen x abandoned to figure the world on our own millenial helicopter parenting until they couldnt do anything for themselves something in between those two extremes
im an overwriter i can communicate faster in writingtyping than speech and god i love a tangent 

heres where modern technology actually serves 

1 you dont have to answer that text or email right away you just need to remember it needs a response
2 you can take a beat or even 12 hours to think about your response
3 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way too many details and exited little side stories
4 then editing magic
5 you can write a wordvomit response that covers way to many details and exited little side stories 

the main hurdle is impulse control learning to sit with what you want to say over time i have learned who i can word vomit on and they wont mind so i have some outlet and how to cultivate more professional interactions with the more i edit writing for texts or emails prior to sending the more i also internalize how to edit while composing 

its a process
i dont know what to do

if you live in their home and are of age move out none of this is your problem to solve get some therapy because having a mother who is trying to poison your father is not a normal family upbringing 

he got mad at me started rolling his eyes and eventually slammed the door on me  
  
he made me set up the camera for him a few times cause he guilted and threatened me into doing it

seriously get some real distance from your family neither of your parents are okay people none of this mess is yours to fix
the main reason i lean towards new cars right now is the savings on used is no longer great enough to feel like they are a deal used costs too much imo 

cpo are usually a safe bet but those are also the ones that really are priced the highest if i wanted used id look on auto trader then take it to a dealership to get checked prior to buying 

with new you always run a small risk of some lemon issued from the factory state of affairs in almost all car lines now with used even cpo you run the risk that someone drove it really hard during the first few thousand miles you do get the assurance now of seeing that someone got oil changes in at least since those are recorded 

best used option are fleet cars with under 10000 on them that way if someone was a bad driver they only had it for a day or two i did find one or two of those in my area but spent the extra for new in the end not sure wilderness end up in fleet car sales though
how big of chips there are colormatch epoxies made to fill in chips  professional companies can do resurface fixes if the chips are dimesized or less i would look into a fix before going through a full replacement and charge accordingly for that
wear gloves and a mask or respirator when exposed to a ton of mouse poop and urine and moving it around in any way sweeping i know you were not expecting a cabinet of poop but that is the exact scenario of how you get hantavirus old sealedup mouse or rat droppings  urine are suddenly disturbed or moved by being swept up and it is released into the air 

yes tell the landlord immediately they should do the proper thing and have the home recleaned and all openings under the building and in the attic sealed along with proper extermination

i am kind of guessing they did have an infestation and maybe had an exterminator out there but did not properly clean the last tenants unit 

there should still be a check of your place that no small openings exist in those cabinets for mice they can squeeze through a hole 14 inch in size good luck
so lovely
damn i am impressed i was thinking howd they get a giant compass but you made your own it did work out well
all of it is great howd you get the circle marked out so neatly
talk to your landlord about the shed because thats your property in there

let the neighbor broach the landlord about the fence 

yes those are things that should be fixed
talk to your therapist or go back to therapy find some tools for anxious thinking cbt to test out validity of thoughts breathing  calming techniques

thinking about an abusive expartner  still getting the remnants of toxicity out of your life is a process finding someone new you like is part of the process of healing sometimes before we are about to get really better there is a natural pull to backslide

the long and the short of it is you can ask someone for exclusivity and still end up breaking up with them or deciding you werent really ready for more but you are here now so why not stay more in the moment of what you are doing and less in the past or potential problematic future

the money thing is neither here nor there unless you make is something that just sounds like excuses

edit to add the religious thing isnt really a red flag since shes moving past that you are making it one because your ex had a similar background red flags are behaviors like your ex manipulation putting you down being emotionally volatile 

the shitty thing with ptsd is we become avoidant and the only way to get through ptsd is to stop avoiding the thing that scares you safely with support but to still face it
 i long for something new

well el salvador will certainly be different for you

i would think costa rica chile argentina or mexico would all offer a higher quality of life than making your first choice el salvador
but now i cant look at them with anything but disgust

thats an extreme reaction look you are 17 i get it and you have a right to your feelings you get to feel however you feel how you act on those feelings however is what makes for emotional maturity 

falling for a friend happens theres nothing disingenuous or sneaky plotting about it we usually want to be friends with people we are attracted to not necessarily sexually attracted but who have characteristics or personalities we like 

try doing a thought experiment if you slowly over time fell for a friend of yours how would you want them to respond to you if it is not reciprocated

id just let them know the feeling isnt mutual in the nicest way possible take a little break from your group and when you are feeling less ick show back up like nothing happened
therapy you have childhood neglect issues financial and emotional enmeshment and you need to learn how to have healthy boundaries with someone who doesnt want that for you 

its doable but it takes a lot of work you dont mention your ages but you are probably in your early 20s young enough now to realize that what your mom wants to likely always live with you and depend on you may not be what you want for yourself you cannot change her but you can learn in time to change your reactions in order to handle her
let me put it a different way if your dad died when you were 6 you may have often felt like you had to take care of your mom 

you dont thats not your job your mom can handle what she needs to handle even if this hurts her
thats totally fair most people who end up in southern california from the uk are delighted with the weather change alone i spent my childhood in parts of england and i want a change now  have a uk passport so its my easiest path

trying to decide if i can go back to the rain though
i cannot get myself to ask him to stop following me

time to learn a new skill how to communicate with someone firmly and still kindly that they are out
stop doing projects with him 

he is eligible for accommodations from his professors he can use tutoring centers request more time from the professors not you get copies of notes but hes not your personal burden

you can have adhd and also be a jerk or just too immature and not ready yet for collegelevel work etc he has probably decided that since you will ultimately pick up the slack every time he isnt going to find the help he needs to actually accomplish work 

tell him straight up that you can be his friend but can no longer work with him on group projects and that he needs to go to the office of students with disabilities and sort himself out
 with the state of the uk and the way things are goingi want something better for myself

i say this as someone considering going to the uk from california for a variety of reasons and i love it here but if your issue is a highly divided political culture  underfunding for the nhs medical care and pay the uk is likely a hair better than it is here 

california is dealing also with high costs of housing high homelessness which has a lot to do with underserved mental health  addiction issues and a worsening fire season we also have more gun incidents than the uk 

to practice in ca you would need to get licensing will vary from state to state you want to practice in and may have to do whats called clinical hours work under supervision for less pay
thought experiment you stay with him and eventually have a kid  your child is diagnosed with adhd in school kid is struggling in class he sits your child down and tells them what hes said to you in that text

how do you feel because id be angry
what the fuck is wrong with people rhetorical question
no one can tell you how you feel about this only you can decide probably the best thing you can do for yourself right now is separate and get into your own therapy to process the grief and get enough emotional distance to see the whole thing clearly
i had that really intensely especially around dating and used to think that reaction was rsd but i am no longer so sure i had some terrible bullying growing up often by friends and pretty severe attachment issues from emotionally unpredictable parenting 

i did a lot of work in therapy on attachment issues and selfadvocating being clear in expressing needs and have found that those triggers are not hit as much now im also a lot more choosey however in who i let in i think it helped me to see the sort of people i gravitated towards giving a lot of myself were the kind who did let me down so being less involved in that helped 

im not saying rsd wasnt part of my issue just that i question if it stemmed in a biological way from adhd or an environmental way from old relationship patterns caused by adhd if that makes any sense it only matters for the reasons of how best to lessen it
as a rule i think teasing or sarcasm toward others only works when it is a joke about someone that everyone knows is absolutely not true in any way so its ridiculous to suggest and everyone can laugh

punching down aka making fun of someone struggling and laughing about something they are truly struggling with is not funny because there are so many hidden things you may struggle with as someone with adhd its a lot more likely that friendly banter is going to hit a sore spot 

so they may not intent to be teasing in a bad way but they are ask them kindly to stop and let them know it actually hurts friends will respect that if they dont not a friend
well you see his depression will be cured if she acts like a housekeeperbarbierobotfuckmaid for 28 days
he says that he needs my softer support and encouragement to get out of this and back to himself 

oh bullshit he can go to therapy and learn the root causes for his issues not have you as a cuddly submissive caretaker cooking cleaning and buying a grown man groceries

what hes asking for isnt interesting it sounds like a total mind fuck to me what are you going to do praise him for sitting home all day while you cook dinner cuddle him and help him care for his home welcome to bangmaiddom
to be honest its not my job to uphold your boundaries its on you

it is not a partners job to uphold your boundaries but it is their job to respect them he doesnt hes also coercive  manipulating you

x200b

i dont feel comfortable with him sexually currently 

listen to that your lack of comfort is important  valid and you get to respect that even if he doesnt
look him closely in the face  you have blackheads on your nose just a factual observation time but gosh i think youre handsome clogged pores and all

next time his shirt is off wow your back is really hairy and it forms a weird pattern just sharing a factual observation lets snuggle now

no one should actually continue any behavior with you after you tell them it hurts you the simple fact that youve said this hurts me and he wants to continue the behavior then tell you that you are the one whose wrong for being hurt is a deep lack of empathy  a selfaggrandized nature
la gives and la takes
i feel like i should tell her this once i confirm a diagnosis with my therapist

nope no no no you should not you should respect the request to leave her alone

something you are doing in this post is still making this about you while pretending it is to validate her experience she doesnt need you to validate her lived experience that you abused her

but most importantly the why you did what you did that doesnt do shit all for people who have suffered abuse abuse hurts a victim whether it stems from malicious and calculated intent or because of mental health her experience isnt changed just because you have a diagnosis

mental health may be the reason but it is never an excuse

in fact the very fact that you are so focussed on reaching out to her indicates you have a long long ass way to go in therapy so keep going to therapy and ask your therapist to help you implement a control mechanism so when you have thoughts of reaching out to her you have tools to cope with them

thats how you improve and she can do what she needs to heal

edit spelling
thats a lot of printer ink going to waste
why are you trying to put chair out of a job in this economy
no the twist is the person who made the post is in their 20s30s  is the younger version of the guy who actually made the offensive art 3040 years earlier that version was trying to make a small homage to the 80s cultural ideas of inclusivity
its been nearly a year have you ever sat down and actually discussed life goals and long term visions

because that conversation in clear terms would basically confirm what everyone is saying you two have no longterm compatibility 

this isnt a there is this one little detail we arent on the same page about issue this is on an ideological level of how to live life we have nothing in common issue
yes it is called being verbally abusive and waving a trash bag in your face is getting to the point of escalating to the threat of physical abusive shoving is actual physical abuse 

the 90 nice  and i am doubting your percentages because we get a skewed reality when we are living with this crap doesnt make the 10 threat of or experience of abuse and assault okay being apologetic for something without ever really changing means nothing
no you do not do online personality tests that have zero validity and besides its a rental not a job with the cia 

you take references contact past landlords  can do a legal background search for any arrest records or issues there 

if someone is displaying online aggressive or annoying tendencies you block or ignore them because of the fair housing act you dont do anything that shows discriminatory behavior
the deposit should be used to cover any structural issues with your unit id take pictures of the condition you left it in ask him to schedule a walkthrough with you after youve cleaned and emptied it to have him show you any issues he would like fixed and assume for the best

if you were an annoying tenant to the landlord that may mean you are both happy you are moving on but its not an entitlement to your deposit

do everything by the letter of the book and presume it will be fine
the deck flooring is a different wood this looks like a shitty homemade job at some fencing edit railings but the question that matters is the structure of the flooring can you get under the house and look for termite damage and how the floorboards are constructed when you walk around on the deck is it spongey and has some give or fairly solid

the fencing should have been screwed in  he should fix it however i dont think it is get out of lease bad unless there are greater structural issues or the interior is not habitable

it is however a lawsuit waiting to happen id rewrite a letter saying you have children nieces nephews whatever that visit you and loose railing  exposed nails are a liability youd like to see properly fixed and see how that goes over
really should have used screws and it depends on if the wood is solid or if there is termitewater rot

while its shoddy and a lawsuit waiting to happen for the landlord im an adult so i can go and just never lean on the fencing of a deck what would concern me more is the wood and structural condition of the deck floor
i hate to say this but age gap shes 10 years older than you at 37 she totally knows better and is not dissuading him and is also closer in age to him than you

you will need to fess up to the snooping and state clearly that hes hit on your exes in the past  you are not okay with their texting like this shell either agree or not and youll know
its the rug its too close to matchymatchy with the couch a foresty green or sage green rug or even a teal and the couch walls would look great id also get a rug thats a bit smaller and doesnt go all the way to the windows and wall 

i like how the dog looks concerned with whats happening haha
can you work the ot for a year tighten your belts and get your deposit up to 3040 that may significantly lower monthly mortgage depending on what interest rates do by next year 

i know theres this intense feeling that buy now or be priced out forever but there is always a way
oh crap maybe not maybe thats why mine so frequently sprout because i lose them in there
giant pillar  no window for sure

temporary wallpaper it something fun and find a way to grow plants up  down it make it a living column in your place
id be very suspicious mortgage lenders are getting hit by the higher interest rates so this feels more like shes relying on astrology than insider secret knowledge of what the fed is going to do
it wasnt a random shooting though to be fairpeople got in an argument and were shooting at each other

i always find this a funny way to low key downplay the experience i say this as an american who has been near or in the middle of 3 shootings in my late 40s lived in several metro areas  one next door neighbors held at gunpoint but no guns discharged

the fact that we have gotten to the point where we have levels for our shooting incidents gang fight neighbors domestic issue not a random mall shooting but two angry people shooting i think that itself is kind of indicative of how bad the issue is

there were several shootings in my old neighborhood and even when they were going after specific targets la drivebys every so many years some kid would get shot by accident and it was harrowing and messed up
 just a magical gardener growing fridge potatoes
it wont be double utilities if you are staying primarily in one home or the rental 

id keep it take your time moving and hopefully you have a smooth closing after keys in hand end lease early if you still want but if you do move by may or june you are only on the hook for the months they cant rent it out to someone else 

plus if you need to do something like paint or repairs you can do them before moving in your furniture
i dont know about their fine print on the program but probably not given joint tenancy is a way for you to inherit their home when they die without it going into probate so you are in fact already part owner of a home
first off going back on medication is not taking steps back if youve taken it in the past and it helps then its steps forward 

secondly putting aside the total ick factor of what he said if the idea of you as mentally ill is a turnon to this guy then understand he has a vested interest in you staying ill that actually is a major step backward in your mental health journey 

that he is going through his own stuff is no excuse
the homeless crisis is bad absolutely but ive been from southern ca to northern and have never seen tents on beaches unless it is near an official campsite and its regular campers
reframe your experience you were 25 when you met a 42yearold online and you had no previous sexual experience moved to a strange country then got trapped in what sounds like a loveless marriage being coerced into pleasureless sex 

stop taking it as a chore and say no you have agency over your body no matter what hes led you to believe
every one of your replies you claim you arent failing your daughter because you fight with your wife and if you leave youd be failing your sons 

this is what your daughter will remember daddys new wife was a monster and daddy picked staying with her and raising his new family over me 

thats it thats the damage also trust me your two boys know you fight all the time so congrats theyre getting effed by this situation too
there was a time and place when flippers were more like renovators and actually did a service by restoring inhabitable houses for resale 

that was probably about a decade or more ago then everyone became a house flipper now i always look sideeyed at any grey black white home  assume they are a mess of cut corners and cheap buildersgrade lies
just because you got someone pawned off on you doesnt mean you have to work with them unless you signed an exclusivity agreement fire her and interview more agents at various agencies
drugged uncool poor apex predator
cabinet looks nicer against the primer white than the color swatches

what grey did you paint your cabinets if you know you can look it up online and plenty of paint blogs will tell you the specific undertones purple orange pink blue of that grey 

to me it looks like a warmer griegegrey so it would go great with any swiss coffee white from the major lines those whites tend to present as very bright and clean but have the tiniest bit of yellowcream to them 

colored kitchen  grey cabinets is a tough thing to pull off but some softer light light blues or very pale yellows could work but it could also be a mess 

grey  grey tends to go dingey and dark in a kitchen maybe in a living room with a fireplace and a darker feeling but kitchens imo should have a bit of cheer
im getting lowerend marriot hotel foyer from them everything else looks really nice or has some personal touches but id say let the mirror eye wall go
doctors visit for mental health check plus cognitive decline  cut off her internet

seriously pull the plug on the internet act like you all are doing everything you can to fix it and drag it out for as long as possible meanwhile someone drops by and suggests a small walk around the block

shes likely trapped by facebook trash algorithms that are relentlessly showing her crime videos crimes are up in a lot of places but depending on where she lives most of it could be very low chances in her neck of the woods she needs to detox from the newsfeed of doom
one document everything and then go to a higher up or hr to report a hostile work environment 

or take away their power this is the hardest path but i highly recommend it they are doing this because like all lowlife assholes who hate themselves they need to find sources of power outside of themselves to suck dry like emotional vampires right now picking on you  seeing how it makes you feel bad gives them that power 

you take it back by 1 not giving a shit what they think of you no wanting to be friends no people pleasing only cold professional interactions 

2 confront when it is to your face someone cracks a joke at your expense reply in a calm flatlined voice please explain why that is funny they stumble to explain or whatnot just reply huh sounds more like insecurity on your part than an actual joke 

you will be a fantastic nurse but nursing in the us and hospital settings in general are notorious for this kind of coworker pecking order there is a way to push back grey rock not having an emotional investment in these people they think youre stupid who gives a fuck what they think they dont set a schedule or grade you in your classes 

but it is lonely and can very much take a toll on you and i do think we are more vulnerable to being bullied 

good luck you got this
eh i see things like this or a prenup as a decent step to make sure everyone is on the same page in case of break up  if done well it should actually protect both parties 

i would try to move past the distaste and view it as a really good way to also protect your own interests  negotiate moving into someone elses home especially one bought for them and possibly not fully owned by them is complicated and you should have a fair way to make sure youre going to be okay too 

are you planning on paying rent aka their mortgage if so whats the division and what rights do you have if you two break up 30 days to locate another place to live etc 

id go over it with a lawyer then come back to the table with whatever you dont agree with and what youd like included to protect you
20 years from now do you want to be 46 in your prime and sorting his 66yearolds heart medication for him while he degrades you

no then goooooo now
i bought some books  think home buying for dummies but not under that specific umbrella for my market california they were probably already outdated given the changes during the pandemic boom but i think there was enough information to make it worth the time i have already bought and sold my first home cant get back into the market right now so a lot of what my current knowledge also comes from knowing what i dont want to do again after the first experience 

start brainpicking every one you can think of interview re agents dont just grab one someone else recommends ask what their home buying philosophy is and what they wish first time buyers knew get a feel for them find someone you think will bring more than just opening doors from a lockbox to the table speak with mortgage brokers in a few different areas big bank credit union solo mortgage brokerage just because you email or chat with someone doesnt mean you have to work with them but its a great opportunity to line up who you do want to work with and to learn more info 

i think the better armed you are with information while it can bog you down the better off you are to make good decisions for yourself  later not have regrets
you are acting already defeated in the comments 

i get it you are tired this guy and his friends have worn you down the campus you are on is poorly policed and a lot of situations where nothing was resolved youve lost friends from the relationship all of that are valid reasons for feeling defeated 

but thats exactly how he or any stalker wants you to feel defeated and trapped 

your only choice is to become untrapped and that means finding every damn resource you can to report this write down your concerns with his behavior every recent event with him popping up with dates and time estimates write it down so you have a paper copy and dont have to repeat the traumatic events over and over make copies and take them to health services and ask to speak to a mental health counselor to the campus police and to your local police  to the dean of the college start with someone and ask for help they will either help refer you to someone who can help or you go to the next person

you dont have any friends because he isolated you reach out to old friends say you want to get a coffee  reconnect some might blow you off but youd be surprised who is happy to hear from you 

your stalker wants you defeated and trapped if you already feel defeated then hes gotten what he wants a way to drain you and force you to stay in his orbit dont give him the win get angry it will help you find the energy
okay you dont list your age but im guessing your early 20s it all sounds like a drama circle and like it or not you were part of the dramaseeking behaviors maybe you dont have a great instinct for who is trustworthy because youve been getting caught up with people who seem exciting rather than good and reliable 

throw yourself into something volunteer a new hobby hiking a class find groups one thing about la its a city of 4 million people there are plenty of nonacting influencers existing outside of one social media bubble

i think it is overall stunning work i love the feeling of movement the pops of foilage and the viewpoint its painted from it feels very alive which is a difficult thing to achieve with a flat medium like gouache 

the main thing that throws me with the pink ground is how much of it is still present in the flowing water the water would reflect the surrounding trees but also the sky so my mind is processing sunset warm dusk lighting on the water but the sky is telling me grey afternoon light if that makes any sense 

i little bit more differentiation in tonecolor on the water from the rocks and trees would also break it up and make it easier to visually move around the painting may be as simple as eliminating the pink in the water with more highlights and lowlights in white and a browngreyblue
any way around paywall id love to see where they are falling out west because where i am in the west id say a haircut off the top in a correction but hardly a fall as of now
theres a historical 5 year drought cycle in ca its just that the past decade or so theyve become significantly drier dry years  hotter summers if we got 23 years of rain then the 5 year drought wed actually function in terms of water although not in terms of current infrastructure 

real question is if this summer gets hotter more current lush green spaces dry up worse fire season because that shit is not sustainable

go look at carvana carmax and the other online car buyers you will likely get even a bit more for your tradein from one of those places than any brickandmortar car dealership
why dont you pause your normal classes for one semester and take a writing class find out how much you can do and what you feel about doing it with more focus most community classes will have writing classes but if you are in the us look at things like the uc extension programs a bit pricey but one class to dip your toe in wont hurt prior to shifting and entire major life focus
i know this is a painful thing to go through if they are actually puppies and still very young while i realize you love them deeply they can go to a rescue and will be adopted if it is a good rescue then the families who adopt are vetted and the rescue commits to the life of the dog to always take those dogs back in

you could also see if any rescues would take them as short term fosters 

get a room and stabilizing should be your first priority i wish you luck
they can suddenly read very well when they realize a tenant understands their rights and will push back otherwise slumlords conveniently dont read true
sometimes when you lose patience with someone or get fed up with them while you still need to watch your own behaviors its a sign you may need a little break

anyone selfdiagnosing or online diagnosing themselves with did from tik tok is making a huge leap the bigger issue may be having a friend who has very real mental health issues but is still at a stage where creating added drama feels rewarding to them i mean youre teens not to be condescending but thats bound to happen youre allowed to step away in kindness if its getting too much so let him have his period of ignoring you most cases hell reach out again down the road
trainer or classes can help you push through nothing like other people around to make you step up im not a competitive person but sometimes i pretend im in a competition with someone else around me at the gym  it helps me work harder  even if they are clearly in better shape i dont stare at them or watch their workouts i just make up a game in my head that i have to beat soandso when really i am just pushing myself to beat my own level im at stay a little longer on cardio or do more reps
 i was just making banter but my bf told me that i was masculine and made him unattracted to me 

hes a total misogynist plenty of people enjoy outgoing personalities this guy is a dud who just wanted arm candy that didnt speak nothing about being able to hold your own in conversation is masculine thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard
email  mail a hard copy registered mail

dear slumlord

as per my text and emails on dates list all dates and times you contacted them alerting you that we have no hot water and requesting a timeline of the fix i am reaching out one last time to let you know we will be withholding rent on the 1st until the issue is fixed we will put rent aside and prorate it for when the fix occurs

the other option can be for us to replace the hot water heater and deduct the cost from aprils rent in which case we supply you with all receipts with our remaining rent payment

as you know by california law all tenants have a right to live in a habitable property this means there must be running water both hot and cold

please let us know how youd like to proceed

 double check la county law if you choose to go withholding rent you may need to open up an escrow account and put it in there you dont want to withhold rent and end up evicted paper trail everything good luck
its called info dumping honestly an info dumper needs to learn the time and place i say that as an info dumper otherwise it is its own form of rudeness 

maybe you can find some audiobooks or bookbooks on the art of conservation and active listening tell him youd love it if his mindset could expand in those directions

or just say hey i miss our conversations more and more lately i feel like you are lecturing me and it makes me feel really diminished can we work on the oldtime art of conversating with some give and take

in louisianna nondisclosure state lived in a place where someone odd in the bathtub it was a former meth lab with an explosion but the new owners had gutted and down a really nice reno jobby on it beautiful views of the bayou too i only learned the storied history from all the neighbors in other homes and apartment buildings around it  

unless you properly remediate meth chemicals from walls they are toxic and really bad to live with

everyone in that building went nuts and i moved out because the immediate neighbors in my building drove me up a wall but it also just had bad vibes and i seriously couldnt take baths in the od tub 

i am going to go with meth walls made everyone nuts but maybe it was the junkie ghosts who knows
id negotiate for 6 months up front cash then for the lease to state month to month after the first 6 months that gives you half a year to get a job but also a way out if things dont pan out place the other 7500 in a high yield savings or cd make sure the contract lease is very clear and no loopholes that could come back to bite you in the ass
from all of your comments below you come up with some reasonable solutions or accommodations and your wife is shooting them down 

she sounds like she has some form of untreated ppd  likely anxiety right now you are letting the person with dysfunction set all the rules for your family and the rules shes making keep her in her cycle of episodes and keep you running around trying to accommodate 

thing is even if shes the greatest mom on earth this is impacting the mental health of your children too witnessing their mother having episodes is fucking with their development little kids blame themselves and babies very much need calm anchors to turn to 

she needs medical treatment and support in the home period you cannot continue to accommodate her refusal for treatment or her refusal to let you hire people come into the home to help 

the discussion needs to be with her during a good period and it needs to be framed with the childrens needs and the impact on them not as much about you tell her that you will be there for treatment and look for doctors and therapists who are experts in endocrinology and mental health but at the end of the day your children deserve to have a mom who is willing to take care of herself to be there for her kids
so current owner is really just a buyer who cant finish their sale until a sucker pays them over what they are in contract to pay

this sucks for the original seller and the next buyer i am guessing its one of those we buy dumps for cash flyer groups

we have a conversation he apologizes swears hell do better even lists off how he plans to do better and then never follows through for more than a day

option 1 one last ditch effort to get him to really see what you are verbally telling him get out a poster board and place it somewhere highly visible kitchen whatever write down one item of his plan to do better  a commitment to every day complete x task then make m t w th f s su boxes underneath and for every day he completes x task he will check the box for that day

this either externalizes things to the point that he actually can functionally do stuff adhd technique or if the depression is so bad its blocking even lowlevel functioning there is an external piece of evidence where he has to acknowledge the reality of how bad it is sometimes with adhd  depression there can be a very high level of denial as to how bad its gotten as a coping mechanism to acknowledge how bad it is to see the very tall mountain he needs to climb and seeing that with no tools or skills for handling adhd is paralyzing so the cycle of nothing happening continues

option 2 ultimatum he either gets treatment or you are separating problem with ultimatums is you have to really be willing to follow through
thanks
eh nothing is bringing home values back down in los feliz

i think recent murder no almost 100yearold murder house frame only intact full renovation  new electricityplumbingroof the chances of it feeling bad inside are very low now if it was kept as some creepy shrine that would be different and gross 

it is california law that any death in a home must be disclosed at sale and possibly to renters not sure about that which is better than louisianna where i briefly lived for a few years and definitely ended up renting some murder homes neighbors would tell me stories of what happened after i moved in just bad vibes all around and i hated it
from the pictures of the last time it was on the market gutted its actually got good bones those old 1920s villas are stunning large foyers high ceilings old growth frames albeit some of the bedrooms are usually pokey with no closets

west coast is always tearing old stuff down would be nice to see someone restore it gutted its still not worth double the value in 3 years though even if the land is worth a lot not 5 million for a half acre lot with a tear down on it
wheres this
this is torus trajectory in murakamis wind up bird chronicles im not in love with that book for many reasons but murakami does make it work and it is a beloved book by many id call him a passive protagonist its honestly a hard thing to pull off so i dont think theres really a term for it 

its also sort of the plot in candide but candide does have agency just all the worst things keep happening to everyone in that story

if my dad can feel this way about one group of people does he feel the same way about the community that im from that the woman he loved and married for that last 20 years is from the one his grandkids by my older sister his stepdaughter are apart of

so heres the thing your dad is racist its very easy for racist people to dislike an entire group but have exceptions their neighbor their kids the people they know personally who they make an exception for or mentally to them dont fit into the hate they have for a certain group they simply bifurcate in their brain

he also may be a bit of drunk who lets that part of him loose when he drinks its worth saying to him when hes sober why it hurts you and what you wrote above a lot of people who lack empathy can only get it when someone they know feels pain and explains it in personal terms so you tell him intellectually why it sucks that he feels comfortable yelling racial epithets he doesnt get it and calls you a democrat but you tell him why it hurts you personally he may have a bit of a moment for reflection 

hell still be racist in his heart but at least maybe not yell shit in front of you

other people in comments who are saying leave nope you need to finish school it doesnt make you a bad person to stay with him for a few years and get through what you need to do to care for yourself
great deal enjoy the new car  congrats

the buyer may have gotten 15k in credits that went to closing costs  fixes instead of the sale price 

personally did something when i bought my first home at the advice of my then crappy agent wouldnt do that again if you have the funds to buy a 1m house you can pay closing costs and i think now in retrospect it is better to make the sale price lower for the sake of the mortgage

if you have an agent they can look at the mls and see if there are any notes
im a big walker and used to walk in altadena to many things for short errands under 3 miles but our infrastructure does not make it pleasant in most of ca

i was super into it in my 20s and was friends with a lot of guys but then one day i realized its kinda bullshit and stopped pursuing situations where i could frame myself that way

im a weirdo and i know it i dont relate to a ton of things that are normal in our culture that i should and ive learned to keep some of that info to myself in public at least but being in acceptance of my own eccentricities doesnt have to be gendered or pit me against individual women even if it does make me dislike the larger paradigm were all inside of

your living with a nightmare nothing youve listed here is normal and you keep saying how it is fine  you respect these ridiculous expectations she has even taking 3 days off to help someone with wisdom teeth removal they can pop some vicodin eat ice cream and watch tv just fine its not like she cant get herself to the bathroom ridiculous no one needs a fulltime caretaker for wisdom teeth removal my god  

you are walking around on eggshells in your own home asking permission to have your boyfriend over its like she owns the place

set reasonable rules tell her how its going to be or she can go out there and pay regular rent this friendship really is toxic shes not your best friend you are her caretaker servant  shes got you convinced the sky is whatever color she says it is
but to me getting yelled at due to the ed doesnt feel weird or out of line

op your inner compass is severely offkilter if someone yelling at you when you are struggling with a mental health disorder feels normal

just because it happened a lot in the past doesnt mean it was ever okay needs to continue happening or should be your future
 he doesnt start getting better and talk about what happened to him she will force him to go to therapy andor ground him

those are 2 very different solutions and implementing neither for several months of this is kind of negligent esp for it to get this bad sorry but it that makes me judge his moms own judgement ill punish him or tell him to go someplace to heal are vastly different ways to address an issue and its not magically going back to the way it was without someone taking action simmering resentments rarely get better being left simmering 

you keep mentioning something happened was it the information about college or do you think there was an actual traumatic incident that shifted his behavior maybe hes mad at his own father and taking it out on you who knows thats why communication therapy and addressing the issue is better than wait a bit then ill start punishing him

therapy now  and meetings in family therapy after hes done some work to have a safe discussion

teens dont completely change overnight at 17 unless something has been brewing for a long time that both of you were just unaware of or there is an incident that upsets them deeply the incident may not be completely rational maybe it is about paying for college but you cant just let it go on for months on end until he leaves the house
if you suspected mental health like an undiagnosed disorder or a physical issue some kind of stroke that caused a personality change like impulsiveness that would be one reason to have empathy and intervene i cant advise you how because id have no clue other than to encourage him to see a doctor and get a full workup

but without any evidence of that happening it means he made a clearheaded choice at some point to cheat on your mom and he is an adult i am sure this is horrible and traumatizing for all of you but when someone decides to blow up their life sometimes you let them 

i hope your mom has spoken to a lawyer and began proceedings regardless of if she chooses to help him if his new whatever she is has access to your fathers accounts it could destroy your moms financial stability
honestly it could be a weird hardhit moment of nostalgia or a feeling about that time in her life without actually still wanting to be with him give it a bit and then discuss how it made you feel and what was going on for her youll get clarity

dont bother explaining things that fall on deaf ears arent worth the  emotional energy it takes 

it sucks when your own family chooses to believe the worst in you im guessing this is a lifelong pattern but when they do call you lazy if you can learn to control your reaction dont get defensive seek empathy or counterpoint they may move away from it some of it is the routine a family has where they decide on the role of one family member the messy one or the lazy one  then pick on them getting a reaction is part of what keeps them doing it 

when you are without meds just say you are feeling under the weather or have a cold starting and leave it at that 

it sucks and i hope you do have supportive people in your life or a way to get some space from it it can be a very cultural attitude

ie dont approach every date like this is the one and im going to screw it up from lack of knowing how to do this but think what can i learn from this experience if goes badly what can you try differently the next time learn to get a thick skin people are choosing and not choosing each other all the time and get out there 

probably with everything in your life especially things like jobs or work you had a learning curve is your learning curve on love a bit behind others sure but the only way you will catch up is if you start somewhere
so the worse thing in your breakfast imo is the kraft peanut butter it has trans fat hydrogenated oil included exchange that for a health food peanut butter thats just crushed peanuts with no added oils or corn syrup and it looks good to me esp if it keeps you full for the entire morning 

a little tablespoon of chocolate chips isnt terrible and they are good energy in the morning the peanut butter if healthier would be great longlasting protein and fat and oats are great fiber
if he cheated and only him  wants the divorce then it is perfectly possible you are owed by him to pay for your lawyer

majority of lawyers will do a free initial consult get your ducks in a row asap and start consulting with attorneys find out if they can initiate he pays your fees no dragging feet on this or asking him to work with you 

do not tell him he isnt supportive no matter what he seems he cheated and wants you now gone take care of your own interests
haha as a californian dealing with the changes in the past few decades here i have a very old grumpy irish relative in dublin and his complaint is that dublin isnt dublin anymore i think he mainly bemoans affordability

i had them years ago once in echo park right outside my bedroom in a jacaranda tree then a different group i think years later liked some berry tree i had in my backyard in altadena that particular group were a bunch of seasonal regulars theyd nail my car every time with berry poop

i can never look at solopet parrots the same i know they love their owners and all but in a party pack those guys are estatic yelling and laughing and screaming at each other i dont know what they are communicating but they dont stop
authenticity without trauma dumping is very freeing and very attractive to the right person

if this went nowhere then you know he wasnt the right person  

dating is a process of weeding out the people who arent going to work you currently have no idea why you were rejected sucks but it could be anything from he was already interested in someone else more isnt in a committing place total flake got hit by a car 

pick yourself up and go back out there there will be a lot of misses but that means you need a lot of swings  only one real hit sorry i am not a baseball person so maybe that metaphor doesnt work
thats how i got 3000 off not a wilderness but the caveat was the better price didnt show up in any aggregate website searches like cars or autotrader it showed up when i went to their dealership website and clicked online price  it showed they were doing a deal on all outbacks in stock then i could take that to a closer place and negotiate a match

i temporarily live in a hcol bubble right now so i did a dealership search about 100 miles out to mcollcol areas and got the better price from there
i just got 3000 off msrp on a 2023 subaru touring xt  not the newer wilderness but i think its very area dependent 

in most cases doesnt hurt to ask if you can find a dealership farther out from where you ar with some negotiation room then take that to a closer dealership sometimes theyll match
gotcha i still say be careful of duplicating the realistic repetitive nature of patients notes because if it gets overly repetitive the reader who isnt a clinician will start to want to skim that section making it filler if the patients notes can occasionally be repetitive only where that informs the reader say highlights the difference in the journal experience while also adding information and moving things along it works well thats just my opinion
ah i left the area a year ago when it was still sleepy honestly though good for them it deserves to make it hopefully it will die down into a steady stream
i think its a twofer people often have some sort of freeze reaction in the moment when shocked so it seems like they are acquiescent 

even though someone by their goddamn 30s should understand consent porn consumption  the internet has culturally shifted expectations and normalized a lot of behavior that actually deserves clear consent first

i think all porn sites should be regulated to have a mandatory 1 minute or so public service announcement on what safe consent is but it will never happen

going to need that paid off not to be brutal but if your father chooses to drop the ball on those payments you will live with the consequences for decades  you are already working 3 jobs you will need to advocate for yourself

car artisan chocolate  manufactory  cafe cant speak to plugs or wifi but the owner is an incredibly nice guy and the coffee pastries are amazing id bet hed be fine if you asked if it was a good place to work for a few hours even though it doesnt really have that vibe per say

i had seen people working there before and it never felt crowded any time i went just not sure if it is a place to park 3 hours either

edit hadnt been in over year since i left pasadena but apparently it is now a really busy place  the croissants are now recognized for what they are amazing
just because patients notes in real life tend to be repetitive if you are going to use this as a plot structure make sure any repetitiveness exists only in purpose to the story  try to limit it or it would be somewhat a drag to read without any other kind of break or plot movement character development 

i could see it working really well if the main character is the patient but we get more insight into them from also interspersing the doctors lived experience one chapter of doctors pov in service of the main character interspersed with patients notes 

interesting concept
i lived in new orleans for almost 4 years for schoolwork and hated much of it due to failing housing roaches the size of small babies sorry palmettos mosquitoes some southern attitudes loud drunks neighborhood shootings and an element of constant chaos thats just not my thing 

but you could be walking down a street of little colorful shotgun houses at dusk while the cicada started and everything smelled like nightblooming jasmine sorry confederate jasmine eye roll people would walk by and always say how you doing and it was a beautiful place despite much of the rot
i assume these were her normal social media posts not some porn site photos in which case he violated your trust and he violated a normal boundary with her total twofer of ick behavior 

no advice other than obviously needs a long conversation about whats acceptable  take whatever time you need to make sure you feel better about it 

my feeling has always been that we as humans cant always control our thoughts  theres no shame in that but we have the power to control our actions
related to her living situation and how she was worried if her dad passed away that she wouldnt have a place to live i feel lied to

i think it is fair to wait until you see her in person and tell her something like i am so glad you are doing better i understand you have trust issues that amplified your anxiety and i think we can both agree i have tried very hard to be supportive the fact that you made up detailed lies about living with your dad and fakeworried about his death is a breach of trust for me i am not hurt that you didnt disclose where you are living but i am deeply hurt that you actively lied to me 

or something like that without a sincere apology and understanding of how violating it is to be detaillied to as opposed to lie of ommission i would have a hard time trusting this person or wanting to be a support system for them the aspect of the lie that would most upset me is it isnt really about safety she could have just never mentioned where she was living since you two never met in person anymore its that she lied in a way that was seeking empathy how do you continue giving so much of yourself to someone who needs a lot of support when you can no longer trust what is real and whats possibly attentionseeking

if she can acknowledge it was fucked up thats another thing i guess where maybe you can rebuild trust 

it sounds overall that you put a lot into this friendship do you get any love and support back
yes yellow boots
he texted a 14yearold to kill herself he sounds like when he was a kid hed torture animals for looking at him wrong
dolores
i hope you have or can get therapy thats a lifetime of hurt in that relationship 

nothing in your text was wrong it was the truth and also you dont have to love your mother you mention you do love her a lot in your post because shes your mom but her mental health is no excuse for her behavior  it is not the behavior of someone worth loving you do not have to make up with her before she dies shes never apologized or atoned not everyone deserves forgiveness in this life either its a hard truth people want others to act like things are okay to make their own refusal to say the truth feel better not your job to do so 

what you do need to do is take care of yourself get therapy to sort out the deeper hurts and live your best life
you need to consult with a child therapist and lawyer if you dont want to coparent with him because of his behavior fair enough but find out your legal rights he did not sign away parental rights  could sue you may be better off getting mediation and an agreement of rights signed edit i would not go off any verbal agreements between you two without a serious understanding of your legal rights first 

also whenif this all comes out you are going to need help explaining to your kids the whole thing child therapist consult
do you need a house is homeownership something you want can you make the payments with current mortgage rates do you have enough of a savings that after the 100k youd still have money for house emergencies because there usually is one are you looking to stay in that locations for 5 years

if so house is a good deal only because it is a thing and it does keep you warm even with a crash if it is a decent area then the house will go back up enough in 57 year cycle that its not terrible 

no one can time the market so its more about what your current needs are than anything else you could buy total crash comes and prices go down but at the same time banks will tighten up on loans so you are still waiting out a cycle

ooh
one thing i was told by my very upfront  honest real estate agent who truly believed there was a bubble even 2 years ago when i sold with her until the word recession is officially spoken everything is in crazy land once a recession gets official then house prices especially condos or townhomes because those always lose value first drop in a market where 4050 of buyers are cash you will not see interest rates shift much only a recession job loss etc 

but rents do not necessarily go down in a housing market downturn or a recession they may dip for about 6 months but then you usually have more people renting during recessions than normal markets and rents stabilize and continue to increase 

take that info as you will if you are not ready to buy i would apply the same hunt mentality to rentals to look for a better deal if you can grab one
as an american exsmoker part of me thinks if i make it to 70 im going to pick one of these smoking countries and spend my last 10 years on earth growing cancer and yellowing my teeth while drinking espresso and chain smoking

ambiverts are a thing but also being an extrovert just means you get energy from being around people and being an introvert means you get energy from alone time how good you are with people how talkative or entertaining isnt really the defining quality you could be awkward and not very verbal but still need to be around people and be an extrovert you could be engaging and chatty with stragners but need alone time to energize so introvert

im great in front of groups can be very entertaining used to give lectures while i get energy during those situations as soon as they are over im exhausted and need to just sit and decompress by staring at a doorknob for 6 hours
because she doesnt love you and may even be bordering on sociopathic levels of zero empathy my friend
from your comments below

i didnt tolerate it i spoke to him i just dont understand i feel embarrassed i dont know if its my looks or my personality or something else

op do you even see how you are thinking about yourself in response to gross disrespect from your husband 

rather than realize my husband is disrespecting me hes pursuing a form of intimacy with his ex and pretending i dont exist hes acting a bit like a high school mean girl you are listing all the things wrong with yourself to be disinvited thereby indicating some part of you believes you deserve to be treated like this

this isnt about you not being good enough in any sense its about your husband treating you like an afterthought and with disrespect instead of viewing him as possibly cheating lying to you andor being a dick why are you focused on how if you were different it wouldnt have happened hes the one who should be different

question does your husband pick on you cut you down in small ways or compare you to  make you feel less than others or are you with him because you already had very low selfesteem and believe you deserve to be treated like this

friend think and want better for yourself you arent in the schoolyard waiting to be picked for kickball  found wanting youre married to an ass
no landscaping or fence was going to mitigate grease air and people blasting music waiting in the drivethrough at 1 am
you are 19 you should go live life just have some street smarts make sure your friends will all have each others backs and dont drink until you are stupid drunk
eh if you arent homeless you have options in sf to avoid public bathrooms or at least use a good one i havent lived there in eons mind you but i would always go into one of any number of fancy hotels and use their bathroom certain neighborhoods yes you are out of luck no fancy hotel but if you are friendly you can usually pop into a corner bar and ask nicely and theyd let you
your boyfriend tolerates this which is not okay its on him to tell them to back off and he hasnt

but also next time they ask for a freebie say no cant do that its for your own good i wouldnt want to sully your pure soul with my corporate blood money
she has a drinking problem and i dont mean like an alcoholic 

oh no shes absolutely an alcoholic you are misunderstanding that just because she doesnt drink every day she cant be a fullblown alcoholic anyone who drinks the way you are describing  who frequently experiences blackouts is a bingedrinking alcoholic 

twice shes also blaming being drugged and maybe she was roofied but she also just as easily could be falling into blackouts with less alcohol than she thought because her tolerance is shot 

long story short you are an enabler you dont mean to be but you watch out for her hope shell be okay let her get so drunk shes unruly then wait for her to pass out to get her home you are caretaking a drunk as long as you continue to enable her shes not going to change 

she needs way more than to cut down or quit on her own she needs therapy a program of some sort for alcoholism and a lifelong commitment to stop drinking shell likely never be a just one drink person it can hold for a week or two then shell be back to blackout drinking 

i always recommend alanon to people in your shoes with the caveat that 12step programs have issues but it is free and available online or in person anywhere in the world i highly recommend you think about attending a meeting and hearing from others who have been through this 

if you did choose to break up you would be well within your rights to do so  it may well be the best thing for you know that might be good for her in the end too because you staying as an enabler isnt helping
first off congrats on the career change teacher burn out is real and i can imagine how amazing it is to find a new trajectory that interests you and that you are good at 

x200b

i have been walking on egg shells trying to be a good wife but its never enough

secondly stop doing that do a reasonable share of chores your son is old enough to contribute and your husband knows how to wash the dishes or go to the store 

he has begin to signal divorce 

lol does he think a 50yearold divorcee who is unsupportive is going to do well out there let him signal away he can divorce you and learn how to buy his own cereal
you are taking meds for anxiety but what about treatment or therapy to learn some helpful coping skills

basically if you ran all those thoughts through some cognitive behavior practice theyd come out for what they are anxiety it sounds like shes a tad flakey and the onus on getting together is on you thats more a sign of who she is in this dynamic than leaping to wants out of the friendship 

those are also things that when you are secure you can just bring up to a friend or when you have several people to hang out with it puts less pressure on the one but when you overthink things to the point of worst case scenario you can sometimes create the issue you are scared of

therapy would help if you arent in it already its really great to work with someone who specializes in anxiety and get a better grasp on the root causes
i would not accept this given youve decided to stay i dont know if this falls on deaf ears but i would mandate couples therapy and her taking full responsibility or i walk completely 

otherwise if she blames you now shes just going to blame you next time
the blue in the shade is almost a rich more interesting gray ive always had grey or neutral cars though so i wasnt daring enough

shes a 22yearold woman who does great work for you and is allowed a life outside of her job if your daughters saw her pictures and thought princess that tells me these are likely normal bikini vacation pictures

dont bring it up but if it ever comes back up then shut the neighbor down much more in defense of sofia tell her shes a fantastic nanny and her hours outside of work are not owned by you or your husband but if it offends her or her husbands sensibilities they can certainly block sofia on any social media
he leaves for a long time to smoke rude gets pissy you talk with someone else while he left you alone possessiveinsecure leaves you there rude and insecure is already drunk alcoholic next he proceeds to break down about an ex from 5 years ago an abortion and his depression on a first date  so you make out with him

the guy was screaming i am an emotionally stunted unstable alcoholic with serious issues the 3rd date weirdness was telegraphed to you from moment one

im not trying to be mean i am just saying this guy was an arse from the get go and each step of the way that he becomes a bigger arse you keep following him in i stand by my point recalibrate how you believe you should be treated
i mean yes marriage kids and i love you by date 2 could qualify as love bombing i guess but the whole thing reads more like hes a terrible drunk and batshit crazy so just why why continue after the first drama bullshit behavior on the 1st date
friend even your standards for what you think would qualify as love bombing are low like that first date was yikes 2nd one was yikes 3rd one was holy hell god wtf

please recalibrate how you believe you should be treated
any addictive medicine is only good to use during highly stressful extreme situations imo as a daily tool to cope with physical or mental stress no bueno welcome to getting hooked i feel the same way about xanax ativan  ambian do i loooove them yes yes i do do they eventually make everything worse in my lived experience yes yes they do 

epsom salt baths magnesium to tolerance or potassium and look into drug interactions if you take medication but most of all take a daily walk and then stretch or do some simple yoga 

it is not easy by any means but its the only thing i have found that will be successful over the long term otherwise im staring down the barrel of physical dependence
please dont have a child with an abusive rageaholic who used to hit you with objects please its not your job to help him and dont think for one minute that once you are pregnant this all goes away it all gets very much worse
he just prefers to make the money and buy it whenever we can

thats cute whens that going to be

he was in love with the idea of finding a house together and doesnt feel like getting it from my dad satisfies this dream

again great dream and exactly how much money is saved for a downpayment towards this dream what monthly mortgage can you afford have you looked at current mortgage rates and what homes are selling for

sorry but your partner 1 is being an ass 2 should not get a say regarding an inheritance between you and your dad you arent married and have no legal financial ties with a boyfriend 

do not cut your nose off to spite his face it sounds like his ego at wanting to be a provider is making him insert himself into something that he has no right to control he can move in with you to your property and pay you rent if this is really the hill he wants to die on

if this is in the us the current housing market is a disaster most people who get into first homes now actually do benefit from inheritance unless your dad was abusive coercive with money or a monster to forgo that opportunity over ego would make me question the long term viability of the relationship in other words hes being a very stupid dumbass
the only advice is block him 

hes in a frat there is likely a collection of girls pics being shared the only reason hes charming and pursuing you is getting pics from a girl who initially refuses is probably worth double points 

also you have great boundaries  you stick to them thats fantastic but you need better instincts to cut out boundary stompers earlier and faster everything you describe about this guy is fake charm insisting on sex insisting on pictures sending you unwanted pictures calling you a tease stating you need to pay back a favor this is sexually coercive behavior you know very clearly he does not actually respect boundaries yet you are hanging on like this behavior is changeable  there are redeemable qualities here its not  there isnt
i am a woman who is hetero but goddamn i love big noses on women look up rossy de palma or anjelica huston actresses in the 70s and 80s could still have noses with real definition before it became law everyone had to get them fixed and have the same little nocharacter schnoz i miss big interesting noses in film and tv they add visual interest to faces i find it so nice to see all types of faces in the world instead of the narrow definition of attractive we currently lean toward fixed teeth small nose straight hair smoothedout skin

the point i am trying to make is you deserve someone who adores you for your nose and whole face not despite it those people exist its great this one gave himself away after 5 dates so you can cut him loose dont even tell him why hell backtrack accept nothing less than enthusiastic appreciation of who you are
i dont think its manipulation depending on the attitude behind it but you both need a set of ground rules for living together

have a clear explicit conversation state one last time you want a committed relationship and dont want to be hooking up anymore if she really does not want that with you then you need to respect her wishes in other words not im rejecting you sexually to punish you for hurting my feelings but hey i need to protect myself here so were changing our dynamic

you both need to really decide what is best for raising a child together get a legal agreement in order with both parents rights stated and if separate homes is the way to go

no offense but the whole thing is really messy at least put the kid first from here on out including working on your communication with each other to coparent decently
it looks like a pretty small space so id stay with a warm white or match the tile but a few shades lighter a warm greigey taupe but very light there are lots of fun colors that would complement the tile especially in the earthy green ranges but as you can see with the busy shower curtain already more feels like a lot with those tiles better to get some continuity on the walls and open it up
well sometimes having someone recognize how much they hurt you helps apologies are great but not if they dont include a complete understanding of the pain theyve caused

think of it this way currently you are struggling in the friendship you are worried if you bring it up you will be put down or theyll minimize it but what if they realize it was really bad for you and acknowledge that so you can feel trust again

say nothing friendship is struggling in its current state

say something and it blows up well at least you got your answer as to how good of friends they are

say something and clear the air friendship is made whole again

the other thing is sometimes friendships just run their course but its always worth trying communication first before deciding that
next time he does it in front of others calmly respond im sick of feeling like shit around you every time you insult me about how i look it isnt a joke theres nothing funny in it its just mean and spiteful please stop

do it in front of others people go along to get along until someone stops it if you stay calm and speak clearly without sounding upset it really drives the point home basically a little public shaming is needed 

also you are defending him in the comments as decent 90 of the time but hes really not hes a misogynist that saw you as someone who could potentially fuck and now that thats off the table his instinct is to deride you not really a friend and actually not a decent person
the post actually makes more sense if they were all living in a zoo
i think you have a drinking problem
picks her up by just her collar so shes hanging off her body weight

yes it is an abusive relationship and please for the love of all things decent keep this horrible person away from your dog

not all age gaps  abusive dynamic but shes young like really young hasnt graduated college yet young the difference in life experience between 22 and almost 40 are pretty huge developmental gaps 

id give it some time because the crush part may fade if you have longer to realize her youth be friends for now but also respect the boundaries of the group
people are picking and not picking each other every day you hardly know her so its not like you can really take it that personally that shes rejected you just move on with your life 

blocking is for exes stalkers and toxic people this is such a nonoccurrence if you are really lonely expand your idea of what friends may look like maybe not an influencer for one thing
depends on the state or county but usually theres some county department that if it is so dirty its a health concern like rats or drums of oil public nuisance theyll send someone out to speak with the homeowners plus possible fines if they dont clean up

hard to know if they are just a junky house based on ops post or it really gets into health hazard territory

most counties definitely have restrictions on front yards so if it is spilled over to the front that would be an issue if it is some kind of fire hazard is another issue

edit op writes standing water  brush and weeds but most of it sounds nonhazardous just gross

look im not a doctor or a nutritionist but eating the same thing wont shock your system though your system will adapt to the expectation of the same meal every day and autopilot on that if it makes any sense 

you have been doing great i would fill my fridge with any healthy vegetable i wanted then keep the chicken and rice part if you get so restrictive its boring and miserable to eat you are setting yourself up for an eating disorder or failure on your diet dont restrict varying vegetables at least have a salad with chicken one day it is healthy and good the calories in  the calories being good fuel for your body is what matters 

there are carbs in onions fructose which is a healthy carb its also a prebiotic which means it helps process probiotics in your gut eating some sauteed onion is in no way going to derail you from your goals
hes basically placing the burden to break up on you otherwise hes telling you you are a placeholder

its an incredibly weakwilled way to go  he never should have met your parents if he knew this was how he felt be glad you are getting this info now  be glad to break up even without the religious issue he has pretty big character flaws including being unable to stand up to his family

the chances of talking to hoarders directly  that gets them to change their habit is slim to none in my lived experience if it is a married couple where both partners like to collect you are totally doomed sometimes it is just one partner and then there is a window of reason to work with the other one in this case neither of them mind living in a dump hell they are living their best lives from the sounds of it 

report it will that fix the issue maybe maybe not depending on where you live and if there are actual fines or consequences at least you will know you took action then wait for your trees to grow
based on the comments below you are now facing the consequences of expecting someone to always pour from their glass but never really being in a stable enough place that you could do the same 

she dumped you because you have notoriously bad relationship patterns and while she could cope with being supportive above and beyond normal friendship supportive when you were physically sick she doesnt have another one of your dramaboyfriend support cycles to go through with you

maybe unfair maybe this is the guy sometimes we burn people out though  it doesnt matter if this time is different you just have to accept thats where they are at i think its a low blow that she tells you to come back when the shit hits the fan as opposed to at the oneyear point when it turns you are now in your first stable relationship but shes coming from a place of total burn out 

not much you can do but in your heart thank her for what she has done for you respect her space and hope you two might meet again down the road
two things going on at once in her grief she couldnt express her needs and in your adhdness you didnt think to say out loud what you assumed was known for her to tell you what she needed and youd do it 

in all fairness even non adhders are not mind readers now if she had asked you to go with her and you flaked i think you should beat yourself up but this one is kind of a gray area 

send her some nice flowers or buy her a plant and ask her what you can do now to support her later when shes out of grief tell her you do much better with explicit instructions and you do want to support her
i mean shes 54  hanging out with these people they all sound exhausting
a teen soap opera because this guys friends circle never grew up
this problem just will not go away

the problem is your friends period even if you all loooove bob hes enabling a significant other who is a nightmare person hes complicit in this

also honestly from your description of events you hold your fiance as responsible for starting this an outside perspective is that the friend group sounds like a bunch of immature drunk frat guys and sorority girls who are too old to behave the way they do and they are ganging up on your fiance for seeing them for what they are

you are in your 30s you keep your friendship with bob separate and go out and make a new friend group with your wife  realize this is not an acceptable social combination moving forward your loyalty should be to your fiance and if an entire group of people is tacitly going along with bullying her by believing sarahs bullshit then you should be cutting those people out of your life too

edit rereading this youll throw sarah out if she causes problems she already ruined a pre wedding event throwing her out midwedding is drama i think you are way more of the problem than you realize youve been hanging out with toxic immature people so long you dont even know what normal behavior is
mmmhmm sipping a nightcap at the bedroom bartop table while the significant other takes his or her evening deposit charmed life
if shes drinking like an alcoholic you are doing her no favors by enabling her when you give someone an ultimatum like i will leave unless you quit drinking and they dont quit then you go otherwise you have removed any reason for them to change shell have to do that on her own 

talk to a lawyer and get your ducks lined up that debt is probably both of yours now but at least if you divorce now it will be capped at 20k in another 3 years it may grow exponentially 

as for her dying without you people are resourceful especially alcoholics trust me when i say shell survive
first of all get yourself some flavor onions are flavor are they sugar once sauteed for awhile sure but also good fiber and antioxidants 

secondly is this all you are eating chicken rice broccoli every day all meals 

while you can get enough nutrients from that meal mix it up for the love of life think of it this way one veg one protein small amount of healthy grain do a poached salmon for a few nights a week try an omlete or a small turkey burger at least change up your greens different vegetables are going to have different nutrient values and getting more colors in there red bell pepper some carrots bok choy or spinach would go a long way to making this a great and healthy way to meet your goals try some bulgar quinoa or millet a handful of berries a week isnt going to get you away from your goal and also supplies more needed antioxidants and vitamins 

only eating the exact same meal every day for weeks months sounds very close to getting yourself into disordered eating

im confused if you were nonmonogamous when he slept with the last sex worker how is that infidelity i think you need to be fair here and not ascribe infidelity where there was none to be taken aback or unsure of how you feel that your partner paid for sex is totally understandable but he didnt cheat on you

it is uncool that he didnt reveal this much of history to you sooner that part can feel like a betrayal of trust for sure 

i think part of it may be that theres a loophole to paying for sex versus dating or hookups in that you can just order service without any of the rest of the work of dating so it can seem dehumanizing and even if you arent judgemental of sex workers themselves maybe you are judgemental of johns

i cant say how to overcome it but if you really love him and the relationship feels worth it then give the news some time to settle
getting married at 23 is actually very different than getting married at 29 you are staring down 30 and have finished your 20s she only just started hers and has been in a relationship with you since she was 18

if you two have never really spent more than a week apart shes not wrong that she should take time off my best guess is you have been in a caretaker role for most of this relationship she has told you she loves you but isnt in love with you that she feels like she has missed out on parts of life and you are telling her you do know how she feels better than she does if that sort of thing bleeds over into other parts of your dynamic whether you mean to or not you may have been controlling

let her go away for a month you dont want to marry an unwilling partner and you dont want to be convincing someone they are actually willing i cant say if itll end it likely it does and this is the slow ease on her end but if she does come back i think you both should seriously consider postponing the wedding
get her a proper diagnosis 

coping strategies can be learned including visual notes phone alarms looking at sorting tasks that play to her strong suits learning how to get some tools to help with executive functioning  including possible medication

otherwise you telling someone just think who has adhd no matter how loving or kindly doesnt fix their adhd 

now if it isnt adhd and shes just stressed  rushed thats different but rule out adhd first
id be very worried they tiled without putting a shower pan liner in first and you already have wood rot
thats chucko the barrelofmonkies monkey
finding a good therapist is really truly difficult i absolutely empathize with that but are you taking any other action to help yourself 

its a lot to place untreated mental illness on a significant other its different if there is a treatment plan in place and some tools being learned on your part how to communicate your needs clearly if you get snappy and moody that is not okay imagine wanting to help someone but not being able to predict their mood or how they will receive it eventually it leads to just walking on eggshells around them 

what specifically do you want him to do to help you seek outside help if you have some clear criteria like stay with you while you do a google search or make one call per week then ask specifically for that otherwise its this amorphous request for help while also taking your moods out on another person 

i would highly suggest getting a good enough for now therapist who specializes in generalized anxiety disorder maybe they arent a longterm therapeutic partner to explore deeper trauma with they arent the right age or you dont feel they get you completely but they have some sort of modality even cbt to help you get started on taking back some agency over this yourself
you are ok with having a child with someone youve known for a couple of months the dudes a relative stranger wait until you have a child and hes running to his friend before approving any life decisions 

im sorry theres close to no way this works out
id take this over to rrealestate given some mortgage lenders hang out there maybe here too your next best is looking at arms do with that what you will or trying credit unions
if you are parallel parking then you are going park assist will freak out and beeeeeeeeep as long as anything is in the red zone including a high enough curb look at your rearview camera next time its in reverse rab is on the left and p for park assist is on the right turn p off and no beeps
tell her you are taking a break then do a temp block 

you dont need this right now what a clusterfuck of behavior reserve your emotional energy for where it matters
after that he told me many other things that he wasnt impressed with about me 

i am at a complete loss as to why you started dating again after that 

x200b

he clearly has way higher emotional support expectations

hes needy you can just say needy 

x200b

 i do not want to cut him off completely since hes going through some stuff

not your problem youve known this guy for a month a month

you all arent compatible in the least when you are dating someone at least the first month should be fun getting to know them this all sounds like work with a critical guy who demands care taking exhausting 

send a short text we arent compatible and this isnt working out
i lived briefly in an ideal fern climate lots of warm rain  high humidity people had porch ferns that looked like that 

even there under ideal conditions i kill ferns
my home country is generally politically apathetic theres just not much to be involved in and everything is working 90 great

whered you come from because id like to move from the us to there

general distrust in government has been a part of us culture for generations but we are now living in a posttruthmyfacebookconspiracyisasgoodfact america and it is tiring
age gap in the comments you state that you previously told him clearly you are not into bsdm there was no prediscussion this time which in bsdm there should always be a discussion of what is okay and how to communicate to stop where he got permission 

none of this is okay the fact that it startled you into not reacting in the moment is exactly what hes testing for how far can he push nonconsensual behavior with you 

dont feel bad that you were too shocked to say or do anything just get out now
my trader joes plant experience 1 bring plant home settle it in plant lives forever grows into nice healthy plant 

2 bring plant home settle it in dies within 2 weeks of seemingly nothing
i find that it takes a fair amount of emotional energy to maintain text conversations with people i am dating

you are in grad school and working you might not have enough emotional energy in general to date toward the goal of a serious relationship you mention in college it was easier because you lived in a campus environment in real life you do have to commit a certain amount of time  energy to trying to meet people and unless you are in a cult or living on a commune itll be rare to ever have that kind of builtin social life again 

its pretty common for people to text as a way to build intimacy if thats really not your style tell people early on while you are dating that you tend to prefer inperson conversations and are not a great texter but also really consider if you have the space for a relationship right now too
separate accounts isnt the issue but given you are not earning the issue is 1 you have no real idea what his earnings are or this mysterious budget 2 you are reliant on someone who is keeping you in the dark

id tell him either 1 you get to know the full amount in his accounts even if your name isnt on it and that there is a decent and mature discussion about cost of living increasing to run the household and he stops asking if youve paid down your credit card with monopoly money or 2 you are looking to go back to work parttime in which case he can expect to pick up some of the household chores you currently take care of 

others mention its bordering on financial abuse for 2 earners 2 separate accounts and one joint account make sense to me for 1 earner to have 1 account the other is in the dark over is a messed up dynamic
kaiser is hit or miss my parents have it kaiser probably saved my mothers life meanwhile i am pretty sure the care there and a lot of neglect even when i have tried to advocate for him has likely shortened my dads life 

sutter health palo alto medical foundation takes my ppo and i think they take anthem if i do a lot of research on doctors you can get some really good ones there and it is affordable 

if you need a specialist at standford sutter health doc can refer you and then it should be covered by anthem
i mean you bring up fire exits the pandemic was also the same year the entire west coast was on fire for a few months there personally think we dont like to admit 20202021 was a mindfuck of massive proportions that changed the way a lot of people behave
honestly youd probably prefer to see shows at the wiltern i dont know how old you are but its been my lived experience that at a certain point in my life i no longer enjoyed any situation where i felt sardined into a crowd indoors places like the hollywood bowl always feel good because the outdoor nature and its well organized but even then the greek theater is better imo for a show because its just a nice size
worklife balance everywhere in the us is going to be tough but culturally texas imo is its own tough nut to crack i have only been through varying cities in texas a few times so i am not going to lie like i know the state but it always feels like being in its own country within even the us 

is she open to relocating within the us you could take time to do some traveling and find a better region that suits you both youll still work until you die but the us is huge with regions that really vary in terms of lifestyle and climate
a conversation in a respectful marriage should make this stop you should be able to say something like 

albert you never use my name myra and it hurts my feelings furthermore the bird whistle to call me is degrading either start using my name and asking for things nicely or ill be ignoring your bird calls if they continue but by all means you can find a blue jay to fly in and assist you 

then start actively ignoring the damn bird call he continues because it works hell when you hear it throw on a coat and go run an errand or take a walk 

hes trained you like a dog so reversetrain him like a dog also reflect on other aspects of your marriage where you husband is demeaning theres usually more than one facet
go back to therapy stop saying its a onetime thing your daughter is going to remember that afternoon  or at least have a deep emotional imprint of when daddy cried over cookies for years to come 

i told her that she has no idea how i feel because ive never seen her braking down like that and questioned whether she even misses her late husband 

and that is a very selfcentered view of grief and a low blow to a woman you credit as having helped you through the worst time in your life you ever think she was busy being strong for you that she had to learn how to quietly process her grief on her own

go back to therapy
p means park assist was probably on it beeps like hell
oh wow thats tough 

he either agrees to marriage counseling and he works hard at your marriage or divorce pretending that having a dating app while your wife is raising a newborn is a whoopise daisy is beyond bullshit its divorce worthy but i can see why you wouldnt want to go there first  he wants to fix this then he starts showing up 

i believe kids are better off the children of divorce with parents who can coparent well than growing up witnessing a loveless marriage
shes 25 so shes the youngest she might be a manipulating cow or she may be extremely insecure or maybe both whatever it is shes a social bully and shes picking on you stand up for yourself 

talk to her next time she corrects you simply say  teal is a shade of blue and it really makes me feel crappy when you nitpick on what i say it happens a lot could you please stop do it in front of everyone do it right when it happens stay calm formula her bad behavior  how it makes you feel 

whether shes doing it intentionally or not calling someone out calmly can make a person correct their behaviors the others probably havent even noticed it but shes not going to want to be seen as mean after that so shell work on it shell probably come up to you later gushing about how she didnt mean to blah blah blah just tell her its a pattern and it needs to stop 

next just talk to anna about how you are feeling if shes a longtime friend shell hear you without judgment 

whats the worse that can happen you already feel youve lost your friend group and are having anxiety taking action reduces anxiety if it turns out she has manipulated people into changing how they feel about you after all these years then its the painful process of having lost a friend group but you deserve better  you already feel like that maybe pushing back gets you back to where you want to be in your relationships and she becomes aware of her bad behavior towards you
so besides betraying your trust your bf is a drug addict

edit i see your comments below where you say its complicated

its not complicated hes an addict he will lie cheat and steal and you can either stay in it and watch it all go down and addicts take everyone down with them or leave now hes not quitting until he decides to and you cant make that happen
if you google genetic testing for antidepressants you will get more info but you can also look up genetic testing for adhd meds but the basics is that it cant state what drugs will 100 work for you not a golden bullet but it gives a good insight based on your dna how you metabolize drugs to know which may be better for you in terms of side effects and effectiveness

edit i dont know why i cant link to it but mayo clinic has a good breakdown of what it can and cant do and how
can you make your monthly payments and do you really like your new townhome then dont worry about it 

arms arent as bad as everyone is making out it really depends on the terms many have limits on how high interest rates can go over the lifetime of the loan  it is capped at how much it can increase every 6 months so depending on the initial rate they got there is some risk depending where we will be in 5 years but if the 1st 5 years are really low like 35 then it actually may all work out even in the wash  

lots of people are getting them right now esp if they plan to sell in 57 years and are gambling that they wont be underwater comps will hold in their area 

if you are fine with the mortgage you have then dont engage your cousin sometimes people are unsure of their choices so talking loudly about it makes them feel more sure just tell him thats great he got a good deal then change the topic
stop engaging her on this topic no i wont discuss this with you is a complete statement no follow ups no arguing with her why this is a bad idea just she starts you get up and leave over until it is clear 

your mom neglected and abused you if you havent tried therapy finding counseling to learn how to set boundaries with her and take care of yourself would go a long way you dont have to cut her off if thats not what you want but you do need preserve your own sanity when you are around her
are you in therapy because that sounds like a lot to deal with growing up and even though she lacks selfawareness for her special brand of crazy you can get help for yourself to learn how to set boundaries with her
well he either 1 agrees with the racist sentiments youve experienced 2 doesnt fully agree the comment about certain food items means we know he agrees a little but also deeply lacks any capacity for empathy 

both options make for a lousy partner
i love dates but they have more sugar in them than most cookies do they also have fiber and lovely nutritious value sure but they are sugar bombs
freeze grapes they taste like little mini popsicles
youre going to love your new home so much that youll find you have 20 good years left 
i think it is always worth trying different meds  getting genetic testing done if you have access and i fully believe medication is transformative for many people  they should have nonstigmatized access to it 

the flip side that people dont like to talk about medication doesnt work for everyone both antidepressants and adhd meds i am one of those people who has had to learn to cope without medication after decades of trying everything under the sun i also have nonadhd related medical issues that i am sure complicate the issue

we are still in the stone ages in terms of understanding brain chemistry
what a partner has to do bear minimum here is respect boundaries  if the boundary is too difficult for them then you can agree to break up

just because he respected one boundary giving up only fans does not mean he can disrespect consent and secretly film you without permission ever doing something against another persons consent like that ignoring a clear no during sex is sexual assault
i feel like you are both being ridiculous you a tiny little bit and her a bunch shes taking something that isnt personal your taste in food and equating it with love and then reacting like you are personally rejecting her its over the top 

at the same time you really cant find any asian food you like i think your compromise would go a lot further to smooth things over if she could on occasion pick at least one or two places to go out to eat that were asian and youd join her in the us there are so many heavily americanized recipes ramen or a bento box at a japanese restaurant fried rice or noodles at a chinese place and plenty of thai dishes that arent spicy like spring rolls or chicken skewers with peanut sauce on the side pretty easy on any palate 

bigger picture if you want marriage and kids you all just might not be compatible cooking and eating can be separated in a relationship but for many people it is a big part of their life  they dont want to live in a household where different meals have to be prepared kind of like a vegan and a meat eater trying to make it work not saying you cant but not everyone wants to try
ill never join a cult because i cant commit to one way of thinking
oh i read all the same articles selling was a calculated decision i dont regret but other peoples fomoattitudes and panic moving definitely made me triggershy to buy or relocate migration during a black swan event seemed like a recipe for disaster to me even if my caution made me mistime stuff in retrospect 

ive lived in other states while i dont think ca is paradise by any means and we have a myriad of problems growing up in a mild climate without humidity snow or long dark days has ruined me for other places in the us ha even someplace like spain looks better to me right now than trying to make a go of it elsewhere here 

anyway i know east coast prices have stayed really sticky but keep the faith your next better home is out there
im in a similar boat sold in 21 in a hcol area to unload a starter house i kind of hated and i made good money off of it so i cant complain about that but unable or unwilling to jump back in considering moving to a mcol area but also worried somewhat about the transition for me a mcol area could get me a wonderful home with a small mortgage based on my equity from my starter home but i also know how this country reacts to my kind moving in californian  need to really want to make the move currently dont 

anyway in ca no one older will ever want to sell given prop 13 made their tax evaluations stay  forever low in an area without that kind of stupid move people would likely way the pros cons for some older people the only way to make a move on a paid off home worthwhile would be if downsizing was necessary otherwise its still likely more costeffective to age in place  

the only thing i can see impacting supply would be job loss during a recession which i dont actively wish for because it is hard on everyone or regulations on short term rentals where the landlords dont see the value in long term rental tenants
untrue it very much depends on location but just as much on the era of construction 

century homes early 1900s1940s in the us often appreciate more in value during 2008 crash century homes did not depreciate as much as newer builds 

there are also midcentury homes that are wanted for the architectural style think frank llyod wright and go for millions even in the midwest then there are midcentury tract homes made out of cardboard and asbestos 

now if you are talking about newer builds compared to newer builds ie a new home development versus a development built in the 90s the newer ones are usually preferable in that they are less datedlooking but they will be dated in 30 years too some newer builds however are really well made better heat and cooling insulation better noise insulation etc
there are better locations for mobile homes than others i know someone who is renting a mobile home and it is profitable for the owner to do so its an arid climate so no mold which is the enemy of mobile homes they arent worth the cost to remediate mold once it takes over  a stunning natural location people want to live there to live in that area so it will be unlikely to go down in value 

otherwise mobile homes make sense if you are a retiree and you know you have a limited time left on earth because of the eventual decline of the building materials resale value isnt as important even then the risks are that you dont own the land so if a new company takes over the park your fees can increase dramatically 

think of them as condos built out of worse materials with less longterm value
can you get therapy on your own without her knowing because you are going to need help learning how to navigate life after growing up with a really controlling mom it may be coming from a place of love and anxiety from her but it is damaging not to learn at appropriate developmental ages that you are capable of handling things on your own

the good news is you can learn to handle things on your own and you can learn how to give your mom boundaries while you are under her roof i would not get hung up on the curfew right now so much as admit the bigger picture your mom created a dependent daughter so she could keep you under her control that is unhealthy your overall goal is to teach yourself independence it is to move out of your moms home and live a healthy life with good boundaries with her
you can be the one to file for divorce
you state in the comments you are at peace with it now and in the post that hes trying to make things right because of current guilt 

this is going to be like a storm system there will be calm and then a new storm system blows in prepare yourself for that eventuality that until you are through this and on the other side it there is no real trust between both of you there is a lot of money is at stake and things can get nasty from you or from him  

go to a fantastic lawyer asap and follow what they say including documentation of all major events 

make a promise to yourself now not to use your kids as pawns you both actually can get through this and eventually come to a place of agreement and resolve but if you try to damage each others relationship with your children it will be a wound that never heals 

good luck
just wave next time if he waves back then you know he sees you if he doesnt that answers your question
ugh actually i found school reports from teachers all saying there were probably learning disability issues my mom just ignored them 
i sold a starter house that i hated for 5 years at the peak and did very well but i refuse now to pay more for the same kind of starter house
looks like it may be the cover for your cabin air filter
he should be wrapped in bubble wrap until that day  when it does come there should be a parade in his honor 

i no longer live near there but romas was one of my favorite relics of a longgone era the strip mall mom  pop shop filled with delights 

the other great italian place is bulgarini gelato vino cucina in altadena completely weird ambiance beyond slow service an eccentric owner but fantastic food 

both those places are more italian experiences than eataly gah
do you want your deposit back and are you okay with an eviction on your record

ie bad idea stupid even given the landlord is on the property if he or she is being flexible with you to sublease dont throw their goodwill out the door
go to an alanon meeting today they are held around the world and online 

the 12step program has serious issues but when someone like you is in total denial that they are in a codependent relationship with an abusive alcoholic its really helpful to find others and hear their stories it will help you understand both 1 yes you were in an abusive relationship 2 how you enabled it 3 start taking care of yourself
excuse me but the owner used to come up to me and whatever i was going to buy squid pasta a jar of pesto olive oil and point out the one that tastes best ive ended up trying even a can of smoked mackerel that was heaven due to his advice  hes too old now and just sits but that man is a national treasure you do not get that kind of service anywhere anymore 

that plus the sandwich is heaven in pink paper wrapper

eataly is costco crap by comparison
emotionally it reads chucky the doll or a tomato person but if you werent going for a flattering painting of miley cyrus its technically good and an interesting take on celebrity
unless every unit in the building is treated there is no future in that apartment building you can poison spray stuff holes and they will continue to breed in another unit and crawl into yours its possible the last tenant was bad with food being left out but im guessing there are a few units there that are cockroach pits and the tenants just live like that id document take pictures back out of the lease legally and take all your stuff to get silkwood showered
its asking for a wardrobe malfunction of the least polite kind in front a bfs family
when the 30 day nc is over i think i need to stop being friends with him completely

good news you dont need to wait until the end of 30 days of no contact to make contact  explain that you want further no contact you can start right now block everywhere and think about what healing from this looks like start working on meeting new people
not legal advice but psychological you are dealing with bullies based on what theyve said so far they dont play well with others and they like the game of steamrolling over people figuratively but also possibly literally bullies dont care about laws moral behavior or being good neighbors they only care that they can strongarm people who they perceive as more intent on civility aka weaker into doing their bidding 

you push back immediately with bullies you dont fear escalation because they are going to do that anyway you get the upper hand 

i dont see why you wouldnt keep the temporary fence up indefinitely in fact id get my permits lined up and put up a solid fence between my home and these folks and around the rest of the property just in case 

id also issue a c  d dont follow up with a intent to remove the fence just that charges with be pressed for further trespassing and property destruction 

id further get some cameras and movement lights 

make sure all your ducks are legally in a row you have photo evidence  document everything 

option 4 feels like the worse option to me its passive and doesnt get on top of this situation 

speaking with them through lawyers for the remainder of your neighborly relations sounds good to me
i like the knot in the wood on top it makes it look like an image from a colonoscopy strong motif
 i feel like the only way i can successfully leave is if i completely disappear or he finds someone else

this isnt completely true npd will not want you to leave no matter what even if they leave first they will still need you to be destroyed before they go so no one else can every have you either way here you are getting something you wanted a path to him possibly leaving and you are upset  focusing on the wrong thing 

you do not owe her anything she can see what is going on and it is not for you to save her you save yourself

the only thing that matters in a mentally and physically abusive relationship is getting out you dont need to completely disappear you need a domestic abuse shelter some resources and to get out before he kills you recalibrate your inner compass to your survival and then later healing
how does a 16 year old force everyone to choose shes not paying shes not the adult ot parent shes not forcing you to do anything youre just not parenting 

you need to make executive decisions make sure she has food in the fridge she can cook for herself if she doesnt like your decisions she wont starve
i tell her its because shes earned it but its also because we always end up ordering from the place she wants as shes picky

even if you think you are hiding this fact you arent she knows you are catering to her at 16 finding out how much power you have is a pretty heady thing but also no 16 year old knows how to handle this

stop giving her so much control over everyone in the family if she cant make decisions that benefit everyone its one thing to have a special day because of doing well in school or her birthday but shes already a difficult eater soclearly food is an issue for her then you are asking her to make a choice for the whole family around eating

shes a teen she can have some food in the fridge she likes and make her own dinner if she doesnt like what everyone else is eating i kind of feel like youve created this problem and are now mad shes not mature enough to deal shes not selfcentered she just isnt the person who should be given the power to dictate where you all eat that should be you

edit from your replies in the comments she has adhd  you sound like you actually dont like your kid get her help with the adhd and get yourself some information for how to handle it better again she doesnt sound selfcentered it sounds like you want her to have executive functioning skills she hasnt developed yet and so you are mad and frustrated with her
i feel like im negotiating a business deal

nah you can get a better deal in business none of this is negotiation so far from what you write its his financial plan or nothing thats actually more like an ultimatum than a negotiation

he also gets upset and insists i dont fully trust him if im hesitant to go all in immediately

well i wouldnt trust him i actually believe couples should fully discuss financials before marriage and get as much on paper as possible but you are the only one in this scenario with anything to lose including your current home

youve known him less than one year he wants you to move to a new country  there are so many red flags and concerns in all of this a loving partner would be fine with you renting out your current home keeping your assets in your name only and moving there for a trial period the level of pressure in this makes me feel like hes a catfisher or something do not like
edit ah got it misread i stand corrected
so you were not as a couple prepared to adopt a cat  instead abused an animal you have now completely messed up a perfectly good loving cat into a neurotic depressed cat the good news is that placed in a better situation cats can decompress and return to its more loving nature

you are responsible for either finding that cat a better a home asap or breaking up and getting the cat out of there 

honestly after hearing you left a cone on a cat for a year and wont allow it to groom itself to enable a girlfriends cruelty i really dont care what you do with your relationship
youve spun out in multiple directions on this from possible school violence to your own future without children and to be fair none of that is really about your sister

you sound deeply anxious a 13yearold from a neglectful home is going to be a handful would your home be better than where she is now with a parent that sounds like she doesnt want her yeah it probably would but if you cant do it at the expense of your own struggles then you cant

if you move forward i suggest making sure you have mental health help first and foremost secondly look into what resources are available in your county from social workers to free afterschool tutoring its possible she may be eligible for several services including getting counseling herself 

you shouldnt be breaking your back doing her homework for her and shell need to learn to have respect you need to be able to be clear on what your boundaries are with her what punishments she gets if she breaks rules etc most of all though you have to take care of yourself if you cant do this now you will need to back out honestly the school violence issue isnt going to be enough to get you out of it
i wish we had a healthier 2year specialized vocational schooling system that was accredited beyond community colleges a college degree absolutely isnt always worth it but there are plenty of entrylevel positions or skilled positions that require one when 2 years or less would get people professional enough experience without the larger debt
eh if its financially feasible no or little loans spending 1822 learning stuff and learning independence isnt the worst thing in the world to do whats bad is going into serious debt without thinking about what to do with the degree afterward
you will
thats bullshit abusive behavior is she in therapy if not she needs to be

if you arent going to break up with her then at least tell her this youre drained her inability to communicate in an adult way makes you feel anxious  she needs to work on communication when shes upset or youre out then you keep to your ultimatum

if she feels a mood coming on she can use her words to tell you she needs a little time to herself 

she seemed sympathetic but instead of making a compromise of some kind suggests that maybe were not compatible

next time she says this agree with her and walk thats either some gradea manipulation or she actually does want to break up and cant do it herself
your dad cant repair what your mom broke but hes going to keep trying 

talk to your therapist  tell him or her youd like to come up with a few neutral noncommital statements to get out of hanging out with your mom 

its difficult being back home as an adult and your mom made her favoritism of your sister very clear you dont have to step up in any way for her now you just have to make being back at your parents house peaceful as possible
someone once told me its impossible to forgive someone when they are still a threat given your back at your parents house even if shes nicer now it probably feels like shes still a threat to you or at least the little kid part of you that she hurt frequently 

secondly she hasnt asked for forgiveness and hasnt taken responsibility for what she did to you as a kid 

id box up the need to forgive her and focus more on what do you need to do for yourself to make living at home right now okay how can you maintain a relationship with your mom right now that doesnt hurt you or bring out past resentment

one thing that might help is to think about how have you learned to be a better parent to yourself than she was  remind yourself of how you take care of yourself 

you can forgive her when shes on her deathbed if you want but really we dont have to go around forgiving everyone the main thing is to not seethe in resentment or hurt yourself with the bad memories  find ways to make that work
no good deed goes unpunished
hey at least we know the source of your mental health issues kidding aside depression and anxiety can make some emotional development get delayed long depressive episodes in adolescence can mean not emotionally developing during that period

but in your brothers  moms case they are misinterpreting complacency  peoplepleasing with emotional maturity in all likelihood you are exerting yourself more now is you being more emotionally mature  they are the ones who are stymied by their own dynamic
just finished watching the final season of you on netflix so 
i think you are getting offended by the analogy which it is still used to this day to dehumanize immigrants and has racist beginnings but the content or the argument statistically men are more physically dangerous to women than vice versa is factual 

the not all men thing does derail the conversation when i think you really needed to state that repurposing a racist analogy to deal with reasonable fears for women undermines her point
so whatever happened in that text thread she likely 1 had confessed private things about your marriage 2 encouraged sexting to get to that picture 2 neutrally went along with it  didnt shut it down or 3 actively pursued or started it

we know that or she wouldnt have deleted the text thread she would have shown it to you it  proven her innocence

youve repaired your marriage to the point that you stayed together but you clearly still feel some betrayal so your best bet to continue working past that is marriage counseling digging up the text thread without any safety net is just going to blow up what you currently have

im personally not on the all cheating means everything is over camp cheating happens on a spectrum from physical infidelity to workplace intrigues to inappropriate texts 17 years together does mean that people will in all likelihood emotionally fuck up or hurt each other at some point

if you go into counseling you have a fighting chance to see not if you can get past this but actually put it to rest if you cant put it to rest you have a solid foundation of how to end things
push back yourself asap 

theres a thing in these types of situations that are toxic bro environments you can either be liked or respected being respected means being a bitch so do that fearlessly you dont need the little chudheads to like you you need them to do their work

have a little meeting tell them for now its off the record that you understand their bet and it is laughable youd touch any of them however if they dont drop the bullshit and start doing their work you will do everything within your power to make sure they fail downward instead of upward at your company 

as for the one at the gym tell him under no uncertain terms  if he continues to stalk you in your private life you will perceive it not as friendly but a threat and you will look into sexual harassment litigation and that he also better improve his work

look for a female mentor above you in your company and ask her out to lunch start a network of your own support there good luck
you had the gall the gall to heal and move on from the loss of such a winning man how dare you not be a devastated mush ball forever forlorn at the absence that is his glory you were meant to put on a dirty burlap sack and go forever cry with the other unwanted divorcees in the forest of loneliness 

it sounds like intuitively you have figured out the grey rock technique  his response is the typical flareup that they can no longer get an emotional reaction out of you hell probably move on in a bit then from timetotime pull this shit on you again continue to keep it cold and professional  enjoy your new life
your mom has mental health issues and agoraphobia so that alone is enough to fuck a teen girl up then her boyfriend oded

she doesnt want to hear this but adoption would actually be in the babys best interest i think you need to stop focusing on trying to get a messed up traumatized 17yearold to suddenly function like an adult and get her some mental health counseling asap she has 3 months to realize that if she loves this baby its best chance of survival would be an open adoption with a loving and stable family
so everything you described about being the best girlfriend is not what anyone who wants a healthy relationship would ask of a partner giving pets wtf curfew wtf you werent a human to this guy but an accessory 

they always come back right when you are at the point that you have put yourself back together enough to start your new phase i swear not a believer in psychic ability but somehow they know when theyve finally almost lost all power over you the reach out is just to try and get that power back for themselves 

you want to prove to him that youve moved on block and ignore
dudes ten years older than you and hes an abusive little schmuck fyi if someone loves you this is how that conversation should go

person a please dont joke about that it really hurts my feelings

person b im sorry i didnt mean to hurt you ill stop 

hurting someones feelings disrespecting them if they ask you to stop then getting angry at them then silent treatment no

dont reach out or apologize for what and when or if he does let him know its over you can do so much better
tv show but big little lies portrayed the complexity of love in a violent domestic relationship pretty well
im sorry but your life goals sound completely incompatible  please dont throw away however many years it took you to finish that phd take the job
question how long are you staying for

she may have bitten off more than she can handle  is overwhelmed she may be a total control freak she may be a terrible hostess the two of you may never be close none of it really matters 

what matters is that your brother is happy if he is leave it be if he isnt maybe hell confide in you maybe he wont

i would handle it by being a good house guest dont tease or insult her ask if you can help in any way and be polite if she goes quiet just bring up a lighthearted topic unless shes acting out in anger or directly gets mad theres no point in reading too much into things
i have a pretty sick sense of gallows humor and even i cant get funny from this
cant you block and request to block all future accounts that person creates id also lock your account to private for at least 6 months

it sucks but unless you want to disable your account thats all you can do the good news is shell burn someone else out eventually and focus on that dead friendship
