if the cheating happened during a marriage i would say take some time for yourself dont be in any rush to get into another relationship treat it like a death you need time to grieve the loss and when you feel ready then you can get back out there if you were just dating this shouldnt be causing you so much angst that youd be averse to ever dating again this was one scummy person out of thousands you will meet in your life time millions of people cheat and as many get cheated on it happens we deal with it and get on with living its not the end of the world why are you letting him insult you this is a person who loves you id hate to see him when he doesnt like you i suspect he wants you to do better so you will have more money to bail him out with you know this but you are doing just fine you can pay your bills support your kid and,AuthorB
really can buy whatever you want if not right this minute but with some planning stop giving him money and do not move in with him ever you will be stuck paying for it by yourself after 7 years youre finally getting tired of this i wouldnt have lasted 7 days be honest with yourself here he absolutely is not going to wake up one day and be secure enough that he will stop this behavior so you either put up with it or you break up hes way too insecure to have any middle ground first off dont change anything fundamentally you for anyone second you said youre studying for med school so use all this extra free time to do just that but get out at least for a bit every day take a walk study in a park coffee shop anywhere else than where you live third youre young but not a child you started dating as a kid tho idk what you did that he thinks you hurt him so,AuthorB
bad that he doesnt want to date anymore but it does not matter this breakup is not totally your fault so stop thinking that way there will be others you will date and break up with use this as a lesson to not lose yourself to a partner fourth get back in touch with the friends that you let fall to the side if you did indeed lose them from studying too much they should understand fifth stop studying so much there is a point where it doesnt actually help studying is for review not for learning the material this all will pass and be a distant memory you will look back on and wonder why you ever wanted him so badly to begin with yup me too they wanted to make it look like she was and harry lobbied for her but the palace said no way then your wife had all the time in the world to pick him up from school and she should have plus your d was away and,AuthorB
its a perfect time for some mom son bonding time your son is 13 hes going into some crazy years your wife should take those rides to and from school as an opportunity to just talk to ty about whats going on in his life and if that includes james even better they do say car rides are the best way to get kids to open up i think theres no reason you should have known who was picking up ty since im guessing your wife stays home with the kids and usually does the school runs but if your wife is home why is your 4 yo at grandmas for the last month since you had discussed not letting him have too much contact with your son i think it was short sighted of your wife to allow him to pick the kids up for weeks weeks i think for this instance you two need to figure out what to do together and tell ty together honestly i think a good talk about,AuthorB
what he says and where its said should be enough what kind of punishment can you give for a kid saying stupid stuff but whatever but i also think you and wife should discuss that shes going to need to dole out the discipline when the issue happens and im not talking punishments im talking correcting bad behavior when its not even so bad so that it doesnt get bad this isnt 1950 where its wait until your father gets home because people now feel like every day has to be a good one a magical day where their partner makes them feel special at all times their lives have to be picture perfect their partner the perfect one the proposal and marriage have to be planned down to the last detail and one little bump just ruins the whole thing its all so superficial that is not reality a lot of long relationships are quite mundane but nobody wants to stay thru that to get to the next special moment but the mundane,AuthorB
makes the special that much more add to that the sense of entitlement it seems people have everyone cannot have the dream job and make a million dollars so they can buy the biggest house and the most expensive car so people basically are unsatisfied with their own lives so they feel they have to jump from one person to the next looking for someone else to make their life satisfying married 30 years since our 20s and it just works because we are ok with the highs and lows we just take what comes and deal with it you sit back and take stock of whats going on in your own life then you decide am i going to let my life be dictated by others or am i going to take matters in my own hands leave the emotion out of it no issue is ever solved by the heart you need to use your head in this instance you get mad id be thinking who the heck does this person think,AuthorB
they are to treat me badly when ive done nothing to deserve it hes obviously up to no good im not gonna sit here and take it im out he can do whatever he wants but im not sticking around and watching and then you say that loud and firm this isnt a discussion its a decision its your decision ok so you know exactly what kind of person he is do you think you deserve to be talked to in this way do you think a partner has the right to demean you to get what he wants why are you still entertaining being involved with him this is a person who has denied your existence to his family based on his religion im gonna guess and say his religion probably would frown upon him asking for nudes to get off to that in itself is so disgustingly gross to me that id cut contact with him he sees you as less than and you have allowed yourself to believe it tell him,AuthorB
to take a hike find a real man who will treat you with dignity and respect have you ever met this guy and by that i mean have you ever lived in the same place and actually dated and are long distance due to one of you needing to move you find std meds and you didnt ask what he was taking it for did he willingly tell you he was going for an std test and you didnt ask him why he felt the need to and hes checking himself all night and again you didnt ask what he was looking for do you two even talk to each other yeah you know whats going on you guys have been together since youre teens its run its course ill be honest i would not continue dating him drugs are a hard no for me you say youre ok with coke at a party but really its never going to stay at just parties and hes already tried heroin after 2 months im more,AuthorB
curious tho about how he just picked up this little habit did he just wake up one day and say hey think ill use coke today and see how it goes if hes addicted its really really hard to break the addiction he will relapse he will lie are you prepared for this major upheaval in your life the highs when hes clean and the very low lows when he relapses the in and out of rehab id tell him he has to do this on his own for himself when hes clean and has his life all back together then to give you a call and you can see what you want to do good luck its hard to see someone you love struggle but its his struggle dont make it yours so the story i just read his lawyer argued he was mentally ill no mention of being autistic so that had no bearing on why he killed sorry i agree with the judge he should never see another day free he,AuthorB
was 20 so even though technically a minor whatever law you mentioned shouldnt apply to him as he must have been tried as an adult whats to question youre a boy you are were attracted to this person who presents as a girl therefore you are straight now this person says theyre a boy but they still look like a girl so youre still attracted and still straight does this persons family know they think theyre a boy did you ask them if they think theyre a boy are they gay then since they presumably like you and youre also a boy still not going anywhere romantically just be friends ok i have to ask are you straight and thought you were dating a girl or are you gay and thought you were dating a guy if youre straight then obviously you cannot date this person because they think they are a boy and you are not into boys if youre gay then you can date this person because they think theyre a boy,AuthorB
except for the fact that they look like a girl and you arent attracted to girls this is going nowhere romantically just be friends since you seem to get along so well then it wont matter if theyre a boy or girl how old are you two how is it that your salary is all of a sudden not enough what did the two of you change has rose explained why she never told you about being pregnant otherwise its going to be a very awkward dinner but i think youre trying to do the right thing its up to rose to realize its what her d wants sorry but she knows the real reason she doesnt want to have sex and its not stress or low self esteem she would have had to been super stressed every day for the past 5 years and really a lot of people will use sex to combat stress if she still has self esteem issues after being in a loving committed relationship for 5 years then,AuthorB
shes got therapist level issues that she needs to address you two need to have an honest to a fault discussion about this ill bet shes probably more asexual than she will ever admit to you because shed be afraid of losing you but you cannot sustain a relationship without honesty especially on this subject maybe just stop lying have a sit down and explain you are so close to being an adult and you have to start making choices for yourself if they turn out to be bad so be it but at least you did it and learned from it and idk how your schools work but if you dont know history or geography how are you going to be allowed to actually graduate there has to be some minimum grade you have to get and if there is and youre making it just tell him that too your bmr might be off if youre using the same number from when you were 250 lbs recalculate it you do realize that your,AuthorB
sole job is not to make him happy of course in a relationship each person makes the other happy but not from doing every whim the other has also you are your bfs first gf from what you wrote he didnt seem to have friends either and didnt leave the house much he didnt have the usual date around as a teen figure out all the dating rituals etc idk how you two met or why he was finally able to connect with you and have a relationship that might not bide well for the two of you as he may feel like he missed out on dating around and sleeping around plus most first relationships do not work out long term but those are usually had as a teen which he didnt his idea of having threesomes may be his attempt to experience others without losing you hell get to sleep with others and having 2 permanent gfs might be way of dating around hell have to navigate more than just one personality,AuthorB
im probably reading too much into it but thats the first thought that came to mind i agree its sad almost i buzz my ha hair and i told him when he has nothing but a horseshoe we have to think about shaving it but i would not just not say anything but who knows maybe hs happy with it while i absolutely agree it is monumentally stupid for a 17 yo to have a car loan i suspect there was a lot more going on op says son wanted to live with mom almost full time so i suspect dad gave in to the car if not more just to keep son happy and not hate him and lets not forget mom probably had a hand in that decision also its not just dad he put money away for college and cars its not that the money he gave them to invest was going to be the only money they had for college some kids are spenders and some are savers and no,AuthorB
matter how much talking showing and giving advice they will not change until they are faces with the consequences son can still go to college he just doesnt have the option of any college he got admitted to his list shrinks due to money issues remember too that d is making up the diff between what the parents saved for them which would be what they are willing to pay or can afford and the actual cost out of her savings yta massive come on dad as much as you are scared about what is happening with your wife double that for your son he is losing his mother the one person who has always always been there for him so instead of coming together and trying to hold both of you up you get mad because he didnt clean his room really how important is his room right this minute give him a break and im sorry but i dont understand the significance of the hair if someone could explain please the minute,AuthorB
he told you to delete a friend for any reason is the exact minute you should have broken up with him when are young people going to understand this its irrational its jealousy and its controlling i say let bf pick whoever he wants as best man maybe ask your bf why if sb is such a bad person it would mean so much to him to be there is there more to the relationship between sb and bf that means so much to bf was sb good to him at a time in bfs life when he needed someone was sb a mentor for bf something anything then i would take that into consideration also it just seems odd that sb is pretty much hated by everyone but your bf isnt really seeing that and i wonder why bring back the hat and rename back to hollywood studios we still call it that anyway weve been going since 94 and dont even remember that hand sign i had to look it up to,AuthorB
see what it looked like i dont like it then youre going to have to remind her of the agreement to not be in the room while you work maybe include in that convo that her anxiety seems to be getting bad again and she should start getting a handle on it now before it gets bad enough that her school and work will suffer maybe suggest she start looking for a new job now if she loses her job or quits will you be able to afford it dont wait until shes crippled with her anxiety to decide to address it at this point just swap rooms with her she can set up her school stuff in the br this way if she wants to stay in bed all day she can and if she wants to do her schoolwork she can also it seems like shes going to either quit her job or get fired so you might as well give her the bedroom now so when shes home all day you,AuthorB
wont be dealing with this every day her motivation is to just hang on to you long enough for you to marry her then shes all set honestly i would be embarrassed if my date showed up to a family thing so woefully underdressed but only if i have already explained what the vibe of these parties are did you explain this to her if you did and she still made no effort that would be a big problem you didnt pressure him into not telling his family but you also only told him when you were 5 months along im sure he knew how could he not but it seems odd that you seemingly confirmed the pregnancy and was im guessing all excited but you didnt share it with him did you share this news with anyone he didnt get to have that surprise reveal from you and share the excitement im curious tho what family traditions of his does he not agree with my dermo told me to just moisturize them like,AuthorB
thats gonna help i remember as a kid there used to be a commercial for age spots i think it fades them im thinking of looking for something like that but i cannot remember that exact name tho i had to go back to make sure but you are 16 you have years and years and years ahead of you to find that special person are you expecting to meet someone now that you will stay with forever its not going to happen teen romances very rarely last your teen years are for figuring out all this dating stuff so ask out any girl who seems to be nice cute or have a same interest as you and stop worrying so much desperation is not attractive at all you dont think youre attracted to her so give it one more date dont discount that you two could just be friends if you enjoy her company heres how i look at it as long as my partner is just looking and not engaging with any,AuthorB
of these people especially if they dont even live anywhere near us i dont have a problem with it there are so many other people who could tempt my partner right where we live that i really am not going to be jealous or worry about a picture on a screen its basically harmless but thats just my personal feeling pretty sure anyone who reads a newspaper or had any form of sm knows about it and talked about it we heard all about it talked about it speculated about it waited for all the details to finally come out and we got a list of people who flew in a plane virginia guiffree got her payday andrew is relegated to scum of the world je is dead and ghislaine is in jail what more is there to say no one who was kidnapped or trafficked has come out in public and accused anyone else im not even sure they named anyone in any kind of sealed legal documents sometimes relationships just run its,AuthorB
course she was 17 when you started andnow shes an adult she wants to do all those things that she missed out on that all her friends got to do while she just sat on the sideline and watched i think its absolutely gross that she called you and basically told you she cheated on you and was planning on taking this random home that alone would make me lose any feelings for this person so dont concentrate on what you lost concentrate on the fact that she didnt even have enough respect for you to have a conversation about the fact that she was doubting this relationship and needing some time to decide if she still wants it she doesnt want you shell go play around for a while and is expecting you to be there when the grass isnt greener dont be that guy block her on everything youre worth more than that wait the dad didnt want one what did the wife want cause the fact that her best friend wanted,AuthorB
one and they had it is extremely bizarre to me maybe its a good idea that his overbearing parents step in and actually get all of them on the right path even if hes depressed he seems to be able to do the farm work he just starts much later than most farmers but if he got to sleep at a decent time he should be able to get started after he puts the kids on the bus talk to him and his parents im sure the parents know this whole situation has to change and if theyre so overbearing i cant really see how they let it get so out of hand i dont think youre too involved you care about his family and only want whats best doe them i think youre trying to get him to be more responsible about his farm and getting the work done no if thats the case just waking him up isnt really going to help unless he stays up and does the work who is,AuthorB
working his farm i think you need to have a serious talk with him if you guys were so close what happened when did fam dinners stop when did you stop working for him you said the behavior changed a year ago so what was it like prior to that and where are the kids mother does she not see them at all does she also just let them do whatever he needs to get his kids on a better schedule his 4 yo should not be up till all hours of the night what is he thinking by allowing this and his other 2 need more sleep than they are getting talk to him explain your concerns if you are as close as you say he might open up and explain whats going on with him is it possible for you to talk with his parents about the kids schedule or the state of the farm do his parents not see what is going on why do you want to get past this,AuthorB
hes been doing this stuff for 6 years what makes you think hes going to stop see heres the thing as i see it yes she cheated and that in itself would be a reason to stay separated and ultimately divorce but you have to also realize that you werent a model partner to her either you lost your job over drinking and im gonna assume when you drank you werent exactly a great husband to her now i am absolutely not saying you drove her to cheat or am i excusing her cheating im saying that you two should both just cut your losses and split up at this point there are just too many issues that neither of you will ever be able to forgive forget or get over get some help for the drinking its no way to live and her affair partner can worry if shell cheat on him thats not your problem any more thank you now i understand what ppl mean when they say it can i ask,AuthorB
what they nickel and dime you for i hear the words im reading in my head but i actually read too fast and find i dont retain what i read sometimes so i have to purposely make myself read slower and if i dont understand what i read i read it very slowly out loud pausing to make sure im getting it im curious tho have you tried to purposely read faster what happens do you retain the info i love that you know that much history of your family have you been back to hungary to meet your relatives still in the village there those pics are so classic 50s america i dont necessarily have a problem with these materials being shipped they have to be shipped somehow but id like the rail companies to have an emergency response team that is always ready to jump right in if something were to happen an approved maybe regulated plan from outside the company preferably good job on the script that way nothing gets taken,AuthorB
out of context and you say all that needs to be said and i never meant to imply anything dangerous or reckless about the weed as far as the baby goes just saying its not the best in the long run for his problem ah big ones i searched quick but didnt find anything helpful so id say go to the er but id tell them they passed out the same day that way its an emergency and they have to treat im sorry i hope your relative will be ok while i agree you cannot make him go and get help i would have one more conversation about it frame it as this we have a child we need to make sure we are at our best for them if you wont get help for yourself at least do it for our child its not healthy that your child will grow up seeing dad have a panic attack every day and its not healthy to self medicate with marijuana ive got nothing against,AuthorB
it it just ultimately isnt going to solve his problem its just pushing it down the road tell him youll go with him to any and all appointments until he finds a dr or therapist he likes id ask friends neighborsanyone for a recommendation and id call and explain his apprehension and ask them to please use kid gloves with him what kind of work up did the dr recommend i dont know about the er but id be surprised if they would do a work up there im assuming a work up would be like a check up with labs i found this tho specifically look at the medical walk in and wellness in metuchen it seems they are free and will do a check up which usually involves lab work idk how the lab work would be billed tho maybe give them a call and ask explain what happened and what the dr said we need to know why your son has seemingly cut contact with you until he needs you to,AuthorB
sign over the car depending on why the no contact im not so sure id sign over the car since you had to pay off his sallie mae loan are you sure hes paying off his car you might get stuck with that too but i also agree i would never ever sign a blank document if youre going to sign it over id make sure to fill it out first you should know all then i do its asking for and take and keep a copy of the filled out form this is what i did and i am absolutely no expert by any stretch but this will at least help you to get an idea of how to get started go here this will give you an idea of how many calories you need to maintain your weight then subtract 25 of that amount and aim to eat that each day get a food scale to weigh everything then i just planned out what to eat for bl and dinner for the,AuthorB
next 2 or 3 days i went shopping so i had everything i needed to stick with it i very rarely eat breakfast just coffee but i almost always had a huge salad for lunch with tomato olives carrot cucumber and a protein the protein was either left over chicken from the night before or even just a can of tuna in water i did add dressing but a low cal and never more than 2 tbspns dinner was 3 or 4 oz of chicken fish or beef and vegetables and a small salad lots of vegs and water was the only thing i drank lots and lots of water snacks were portioned out nuts or a string cheese or just plain carrots have a glass of water before you snack to see if you really want to snack or if you just wanted something it seems daunting at first but you will get used to it pretty quickly but weigh everything i even weighed out teeny amounts of carrot and celery for my,AuthorB
salad a lot of times it ended up being like 6 calories but i still counted it you can do this just dont try to be so militant crazy to start because you wont stick with it its ok to be over your calories when you start but you want to be over by 50 not 500 i would cruise alone but make sure to go to the solo traveler meet up on the ship go meet other solos these would be the people you can hang around with on that sailing and you might get lucky and find one or two who you get along with and can plan future trips with i wouldnt trust rooming with a random stranger im a little confused about justin hes not the babys dad we know that you met him when you both lived in diff states and somehow he just decided he would be dad and you allowed that then you break up and he still wants to be dad even going as far as,AuthorB
wanting to help with daycare have you even met this person have you ever lived in the same place all of this seems really really odd you broke up he wasnt in your life or your sons for all that long as a dad figure so why would you even entertain the idea of him being a father figure to your son now brian on the other hand do you know for a fact that he is the father because honestly it might be better for your son if hes not the in out is ultimately going to leave your child feeling not enough he doesnt support the child and you seem to be doing ok without him and now greg i would have him tested to see if hes actually your sons dad even if you dont want any support from him and even if he doesnt want anything to do with his child its better for everyone involved to have a definitive answer to this question if he is then you can,AuthorB
cut brian out all together because really who needs the problems he comes with hes out of state has 2 other kids is in and out on a whim and doesnt pay any support in short find out who the father actually is then decide if you want to go for support and visitation dont have some random out of town guy playing dad to your son live your life raise your son and dont be so quick to want to have a daddy for him yta show some respect for your grandfather and your grandmother is this really something you want to even have an argument with your family about at this time everyones stressed on edge and its going to become about more than what it actually is this is not the time or place for you to make this about you your clothing choices over the years or what your family thinks about your choices either wear the dress pants or bring them and change into them why are you even,AuthorB
entertaining anything she says after telling her youre done this is not working for you anymore wish her well and hang up block her everywhere and get on with your life she lives 4 hrs away from you its not like shes gonna go around town talking about you or making your life miserable its not really that hard this has been my fear forever also not just being uncovered but i could never even have my feet hang off the bed i do not have any idea how people sleep with no covers not even a sheet nope i need an actual comforter even in the summer nta at all this is a lovely thing to do with your nieces and especially since its the younger ones first time it should be just the 4 of you this is something you and your sister can do forever with the girls and they will love it im sure your sil does things with her sibs and all the kids they dont have to infringe,AuthorB
on your day ok so wait im confused the general tip box welfare thing what exactly is this are you saying the gratuities that we all pay is not going to the crew ive read its room steward and the other positions that guests dont see like cooks laundry etc workers who dont normally interact with guests i always pay mine and give the steward extra but id like to know that the behind the scenes people are getting their cut so if we dont pay it the cook and laundry people will still get their same salary but the company will then be shouldering the burden of that whole amount which they should anyway instead of being supplemented by guests if thats the case im taking my tips off and will try to find a way to funnel to those people and of course tip the steward his cut plus my extra am i understanding this correctly nah but he cannot always respond the way you want or need he doesnt know what,AuthorB
you want him to do or what you need heres the thing tho youve been together since you were 15 and both of you are going to go off to college and will have a whole host of new experiences and meet new people not just him not to be mean but i would be very surprised if one of you if not both of you get to college and realize you dont want to be tied down to someone who is not part of your every day it could very well be you deciding theres someone else out there that youd like to get to know it happens and it should happen you both need to be free to grow and mature the summer before college is a weird time both of you are going to be anxious nervous about going away being on your own for the first time can you handle it will you find friends will you be able to keep up with classes etc so dont stress about hypothetical,AuthorB
things when you have enough real things that will stress you out we went twice in one day and my h was that guy both times the rest of us loved it he was not amused nta for not giving a gift its costing you a lot to go and she did say its understandable so believe her before i say more tho what kind of reception has no alcohol and no food what exactly is everyone supposed to do during the party part of the wedding reception but theres a few things you say that come off as concerning why do you care that they are married but having the celebration later maybe they did it for tax purposes for religious reasons or just because they felt like it not your business your thought that she wont be giving you a gift when you get married next year is bizarre they are almost 10 yrs younger than you and your bf how much of a gift were you actually expecting from them not,AuthorB
having alcohol at the wedding isnt odd at all really plenty of people make that choice im getting weird vibes as if youre taking her wedding as a slight against you personally somehow shes having her celebration before yours even tho youve been engaged longer she picked the worst time according to your schedule and her wedding is not what you deem acceptable her wedding really has nothing to do with you your bf or anyone else you understandably said its costing you a lot to go and how its really stretching the budget but youve already got 2 weddings youre going to next year undoubtably your friends or fam and i can see how youd say well those were planned and hers was a quickie thing that came up and wasnt really budgeted for but this is the family you are going to marry into so id stretch that budget go with a smile and dont burn bridges before youve even been accepted into the family and its not your place to fight,AuthorB
your bfs family battles if hes always put last its up to him to fix it or not im still not sure what the parents or grands having money has anything to do with bf being put last tho i think it comes from our education system most people graduate hs at 1718 and years back it was pretty common to get married to your hs sweetheart so if youre married at 18 you have to be allowed to do all the adult things job mortgage kids etc and i agree with the other poster by 18 youve seen and heard enough to be able to make wise choices why some might not is for the same reasons why a 25 or 35 or any other age might not im going to assume youre still somewhat young ignoring him isnt the way to go about this or any other issue or problem that comes up use your words you think he was joking but youre not sure so you ignore him for 15 min,AuthorB
but then after that amount of time you what just start engaging with him again as if nothing happened then what was the actual point of not talking to him in the first place look if he says something and you arent sure if its an insult or a joke you have two ways to handle this might be a joke answer back with a joke youre free to leave at any time theres the door and see what he says he probably would answer back with something like he just hates shopping thats like the hundredth store weve been in etc you banter back and forth a few times and its over you think its insulting then you tell him hey that hurt whats the problem and he explains the exact same thing as above hes just frustrated being in the mall learn now how to communicate it will save you tons of drama in the future think back to every place you have been since you last remember seeing it on the,AuthorB

line will not speak to you about anything to do with the booking because you technically are not the one who booked it i hope this helps i agree so much with this i dont like mexican food all that much but i have never even tried refried beans just the look of it never mind the smell makes me gag nta its pretty standard procedure which if hes a regular he would know anyway would it help if you mentioned it to the dr i would like to think the dr doesnt want him talking to his staff the way he did you dont say how long you are together in my opinion this is in no way cheating what happened was you saw a very attractive person and had a physical response to the level of attractiveness it happens whatever this guy looked like just hit your senses in a certain way it doesnt mean you dont find your bf attractive doesnt mean you dont like or love him i wouldnt say,AuthorB
a word to bf all that will do is start drama of you dont find me attractive you dont want to be with me you want him honestly its just not worth it are you bored that youre not fighting anymore cause this feels like youre looking for more things to fight about you guys are really young but if you are under the misguided idea that once you love someone you should never find any other person attractive youre going to find that is just not the case if you think your bf does not find any other girls attractive youre kidding yourself edit to add or you just were fed up with fighting with your bf and your subconscious is telling you to break up nta you didnt say anything even slightly upsetting the fact of the matter is that maddie is not your mothers d and the heirlooms are being passed down through your mothers family maddie might have a case to be upset if these heirlooms were passed down thru,AuthorB
your dads family but they are not maddie is 17 she knows how this stuff works so you guys havent been together all that long is there any truth to him saying if it wasnt for the baby you wouldnt be together or was he just saying that to hurt you because you hurt him is his need to get rich now a new thing maybe hes stressing about what he thinks should be his role as provider for the family now with the baby on the way the thing is starting his own business is going to take all of his time to get going when is he gonna have time to be a dad get to know his baby give you a break from work and parenthood your text was a bit rough but the basic message needed to be said you should have had a serious talk about what you see the future like be the bigger person and go talk to him get this settled or itll keep coming up,AuthorB
again and again how long are you two together do they have a registry if i could afford it for sibs id go with something big car seat stroller high chair etc if i couldnt afford that or im a younger sib who doesnt work yet or still in school id get a baby bath and fill it with bath supplies towels shampoo baby wash rubber ducky and diapers theyll need lots of diapers but not newborn size go one or two sizes up everyone gets newborn and they grow out of them pretty quick sorry this is gonna come off as slightly mean but what exactly are you bringing to the table you work when youre not sleeping most of the day due to your anxiety and depression you have no hobbies not that i think its a big deal but it could make you you seem to be kind of boring you dont like sex but are willing if the guy is successful enough frankly that is so gross because you seem,AuthorB
to think its a transaction take me out buy me things and ill lay back and suffer while you do your thing yet youre looking for a guy who by your own admission seemingly has everything going for him oh and this guy has to put you on a pedestal ask yourself why this imaginary wish list guy would want to be with you youre going about this all wrong relationships take time and you have to put in the time stop looking for prince charming and find your own prince one who melds into your life not one who comes ready made with a lifestyle that you think you deserve build that lifestyle together just something to think about can i ask what you mean by you work when you get the motivation do you not work full time have your own business im not really sure why location would have anything to do with laundering clothes but ill give some ideas im assuming you have a washing machine you can try just,AuthorB
adding regular laundry bleach to your wash for stains best thing ive found is oxyclean i wet the garment put a little of the powder on the stain and work it into a sort of paste let it be for a bit then launder it i add about a half scoop into the washing machine along with whatever detergent i use i have also soaked generally dingy whites in hot water and the oxyclean i try to get the oxy to dissolve add the garment leave overnight and then launder if you dont have a washing machine use your bathtub im very late to the party but with regards to him mentioning his age it may be that hes saying that if you have met he may not remember it i think based off your lor which he read this prof probably found something in it that peaked his interest in you was there any mention of a project you worked on with the student maybe he is just interested in your particular field,AuthorB
maybe he just likes to meet the up and coming people in the field either way i think it might turn out to be a very interesting lunch think of the stories he could tell you from years back in regards to your field of study i had an older prof of paleontology who had the most fascinating stories of his field work if you do end up meeting him can you update us please nta if shes your friend she would already know that you have been trying to have a baby for a few years does she really think you would plan to be pregnant or have had a baby right around her wedding on purpose shes literally being a bitch right now and the worse part for me is that the other bridesmaids felt the need to text you who the hell do these women think they are your pregnancy is none of their or anybody elses business they can all just fuck right off i wouldnt even go and even,AuthorB

the wellbeing of the child to be placed elsewhere until mom can get the help she needs its not like the 7 yo can raise a red flag for himself better they make the call and a trained impartial person can go and assess if all is ok if it is then great everything goes back to the way it is but if its not then both mom and child get the help they need im not saying you should go but heres a thought you should ask him to find out what the schedule actually is surrounding the wedding what activities does he have to be there for if any have him ask the groom what the seating is like sometimes the bridal party is sat at one table together with their dates or is there a get together prior to the wedding for the bridal party and their dates youll meet the other plus ones who if youre not seated with your bf youll be with the other plus ones but youll,AuthorB

loans were never going to cover the full cost of college the maximum loan that can be taken out thru the govt is 31000 divided over 4 years in the big picture this isnt a crippling amount people end up with huge debt because they then go out and get private loans for the balance or their parents take out parent loans with the agreement that the student pay it back so the govt makes the loan the student graduates and pays back the loan with interest the act of repaying this loan plus the interest is then used to fund the next batch of students that need them cancelling 10000 or 20000 for pell grant recipients of loans is essentially taking away some of the ability of this loan program to fund itself so that means the govt essentially every taxpayer is paying for this relief i have a definite problem with continuing a program that basically has no funding source other than more spending the govt is making loans to incoming freshman,AuthorB

them and of course the obligatory 1 dad shirt or coffee mug i had barely knew my future mil when we got engaged of course we met but we didnt spend very much time together my mother had one rule she and only the the bride to be would be going dress shopping she paid for out dress and it was a motherdaughter thing no friends no sisters i have 3 no anybody else none of the mils had a problem with this once it was explained and my mil only had boys so she would never get that experience now i also have 2 brothers and saw how mom was left out of any wedding planning so i invited my mil to the food tasting at the catering hall just me and her h was workingand brought and showed her everything we were debating on i wanted her to feel involved it was her sons wedding also your sil and mil are out of order definitely no argument there but mil may feel,AuthorB
hurt and sil is fighting her battle which she shouldnt so maybe just try to be a little more open with some of the other wedding planning you dont have to take her picks or advice but at least make her feel like she is in the know so to speak and remember its her sons wedding also she just doesnt want to show up and have no idea what its gonna be like nta i absolutely love your idea it showed everyone what was involved and exactly why they couldnt handle it and bravo for handling the grandparents brilliant i think your h should be the one telling the kids he can explain why it wasnt a good idea at this time mostly because he couldnt keep up with the conditions he might mention it wouldnt be very fair to mom who doesnt want the dog if she got stuck taking care of it as an added bonus i agree why william would ever want to even talk to h after such a,AuthorB
betrayal is beyond me some things you just dont come back from and what h has done is one of them can you even imagine the deep hurt w feels coming from his only sibling i can see charles wanting some sort of relationship he is his son after all but i would like to think even charles realizes it needs to be a distant check in how you doing sort of relationship kind of like you dont wish any harm but you dont go out of your way to be close charles aside harry has to be seriously delusional if he thinks anyone in his family is going to want any kind of relationship with him and the wife not a snowbells chance in hell they had to pick a lane and they picked celebrity over family at the expense of family now they have neither the quicker they realize that the better from one 30 married to another ive always said thats the secret of course we love each other but we,AuthorB
actually like each other thats a big distinction isnt it one im not sure some people understand wishing your husband a speedy recovery and more happy years to the both of you yeah sorry none of that is even remotely ok especially that disrespectful bs with the picture can he not have an adult conversation is it a matter of him not having any money but then he should have at least acknowledged the day does he not do anything for any special day at all you need a serious come to jesus talk with him how exactly does he see you and this relationship is he in love with you or did this pairing just move along until you had a child together and it evolved to where you are now sorry to be so blunt take a good hard look at your relationship im gonna take a guess and say this pairing is much more beneficial for him than it is for you the best way to act in this situation you,AuthorB
reconcile this is your own head as you had a good time while it lasted but its run its course youve been long distance with periods of not seeing each other and now hes moving even farther away do you really want to keep this up a few days together every once in a while how about finding a guy who lives near you that you can actually try to have a future with info please ok you had the conversation but what did he say was the reason he did not do anything for v day we need to know what his mindset is before we can actually give any advice it wasnt your moms fault your mom just brought up some uncomfortable things that you and your partner should have been discussing anyway since you didnt your partner had time to think thru the issues your mom brought up and came to a conclusion that it wouldnt work was your gf supposed to go vegetarian and learn hindi your mom points this,AuthorB
out but you dont actually say if this is what you wanted also long distance is hard your mom maybe didnt want you two separated for that long she likes your gf didnt want to see you break up the dream may not have happened but it made your gf really think if she could fit in with your culture i dont think your mom had any bad intentions your just sad and want to blame someone did anyone really need a study to know this i love a good full salad but i hate all the chopping that goes into it so i make a huge salad that can last about 3 days so as long as its readily available ill eat it maybe try that make a basic salad that you can add diff things to it to at least make it slightly diff each time the problem i see with even trying to have a conversation about his weight is that he knows hes overweight and hes probably embarrassed by it,AuthorB
so i wouldnt harp on it too much for fear of making him feel even worse about it if he thinks you only care about how he looks instead of how he feels that will add to his feeling bad about himself not saying you do this just that kids might twist it to that maybe just a gentle hey kiddo covid lockdowns really did a number on all of us i worked so much i didnt really see what was going on with you or your bro im sorry im not judging you at all but we both have to realize that your weight is unhealthy if you want to or need help figuring out what we can do im here ill listen and well figure it out together and if theres anything else youre struggling with and need help well get some help i just want you healthy and happy then leave him alone about it maybe just give him a few extra hugs he knows what he has to do and,AuthorB
he has a world of info with the internet if he wants to do it himself editing after seeing some of op replies therapy would be great but only if hes ok with it otherwise hell just refuse to talk he seems to have a lot going on teens seem to be coming out of covid with mental health issues add to that his confusion of his sexuality and its a lot for a teen to deal with have you taken him for a full physical covid weight gain is real but thats a lot of weight maybe theres a medical reason id at least rule that out nta lets see if mom is willing to support her i get the whole dont make her pay cause im the parent and all that but that only works as long as you can afford it what kind of child sees a parent struggle and still isnt willing to help a selfish one your d needs to be on her own for a while shell get,AuthorB
a dose of real life im not judging at all just saying theres a lot missing from the info they put out i can see the 5 yo being with a parent getting gas perfectly fine so i wondered were they in the car caught in a crossfire or were they being babysat by one of the other teens and brought to a party not good how did it get that we have to actually teach our kids that we dont try to kill anyone we have a problem with its a nuclear option to use sad really right so there was an altercation at a party that spilled over to the gas station did someone bring the 5 yo to the party was the 5 yo there with a parent maybe and got caught in the crossfire but why would the child be out of the car so many questions time lots of time you need to date someone until you know them really know them we rush into relationship ships because we,AuthorB
want someone anyone were so afraid of falling behind our friends our peers that we take good enough instead of good no guy is totally going to revolve his whole life around youc yea hes being mean and unhelpful to boot he needs to get out of that habit before your child gets older little people need lots of help finding their stuff ok nta whatever she did with it she should have picked it up i dont care how busy she is shes been in that bathroom at least a couple of times over the 2 days and then to yell at you and threaten no sex over it thats a massive over reaction time for a little chat about disrespect of your spouse did she leave her bra in the shower or just in the bathroom how did it get soaking wet i heard it a couple days ago its heartbreaking to think that no one did anything for the boy but i also wondered why the coaches were not required to,AuthorB
know cpr even if not you try you have 911 walk you thru it just something i was a cub scout leader and volunteered as a coach for my kids grade school and it was required of every parent coach or for scouts every leader thank goodness mine are grown or now id be staying thru every practice and game im so confused you dated kate but never met her family for 4 years how you must have lived in the same neighborhood if you went to the same hs next you break up with kate during college and what change colleges to the one thats a state over maybe things happen then you meet julia who wont let you meet her fam because she went nc because they sent her away where to take care of her sister would this be kate you finally meet julias fam who turn out to be kates fam and what do you know julia also lives in your old neighborhood and instead of acknowledging to the parents,AuthorB
that you and kate had dated for 4 yrs before you met julia you say nothing you tell julia and shes just hunky dory about it and kate just happens to let this cat out of the bag that she had been pregnant in college not exactly what his think would be dinner convo but whatever then you yell at kate because why so i call bs on all of it so heres my very rudimentary explanation i dont own a gun the us is a relatively young country and when it was first discovered there was nothing except for the indian settlements but there was vast wilderness guns have always had a place in our country because they were a means of survival had to hunt for food protect land and animal stock and yes even protection from horse rustlers and robbers so then we fight for our independence from a country who had a national army way back we had no central army we had 13 colonies spread far apart and communication,AuthorB
would take days so even if we wanted a central army it wasnt feasible so each state had its own militia to be used in case of attack by a foreign army thats why it was written into the constitution as a right to bear arms we were determined not to be ruled over again as the country became more industrialized and modern there were and still are very rural places where some people need to shoot prey animals you have to realize just how big this country is there are still vast swathes of undeveloped wilderness there are also people who move from those very rural places to suburbia or cities who genuinely enjoy going to a range and practicing their skill it was there way of life after all or they just enjoy hunting so while mass shootings are mostly done by someone who it later turns out had bought a legal gun you have to remember that the everyday random violence is mostly perpetrated by criminals who do not buy guns,AuthorB
legally and that gets us into a whole other conversation so you cant bar someone from legally buying a gun in most cases it is their right but you also cannot stop them from using it to commit crimes theres lots of ideas going around but outright banning gun sales is never going to happen while your stat is true it needs to be put in perspective as per this website we found that some 297033 children were married in the us between 2000 and 2018 232474 based on marriagecertificate data plus 64559 based on estimates table 1 a few children were as young as 10 years when they married but of those for whom age information was available nearly all96were aged 16 or 17 years of those for whom age gender and spousal information was available 78 were girls under 18 years of age wed to adult men aged 18 years or older the national number of children wed decreased each yearfrom 76396 in 2000 to 2493 in 2018 table 2but is unlikely,AuthorB
to get to zero without legislative intervention so 96 were 16 and 17 hardly what most people think of when they hear child marriages and the number for 2018 is 2493 total out of 350 million people in comparison one out of every five marriages in iran is a child marriage a total of 550565 marriages were registered in march 2018 to march 2019 in 112647 cases the bride was ages 17 years or less more than a fifth of marriages registered in iran during that year were therefore child marriages by unicefs measurefeb 9 2020 features twenty percent of marriages in iran are child marriages iran has a population of about 85 million people from the same article data from the national organization for civil registration records that around 1100 girls under the age of 12 were married in 20172018 more recently the figure has been around 2600 girls this is in the range of two or three marriages per thousand registered throughout the year which is a large and significant number considering,AuthorB
the legal obligation to secure court approval the law permits a judge to issue a marriage license in all such cases when it is expedient to do so now i condone any marriage to a child in any country in any circumstance but two 16 or 17 yos who find themselves pregnant marrying each other is very diff than a 12 and under literal child marrying a grown man how long were you dating before you moved in it hasnt even been a year that youve been together which means you havent even scratched the surface of really getting to know this person it isnt all about love thats part of the problem you think that just because he loves you hes going to think of your wants and needs all the time hell be appreciative of any little thing you do for him and the household youre under the impression that the two of you are working toward something and that all he has to do is talk to you and all will,AuthorB
be magically better but the reality is hes a depressed guy who wont do anything about it and just wants to get lost in his games so he doesnt have to deal with real life next time he tells you to leave do it save yourself and get out before you waste more time with someone who seemingly adds no value to your life thank you lots of good info that sounds like my kind of cruise what youre failing to realize is that the only reason you want him back in your life is that you are struggling with making connections with other people thats you being selfish you didnt like lily because she was in effect taking kaleb away from you you didnt want to share him now id say you probably didnt intentionally kill her because thats just too out there but you also didnt try to keep your dad and family from threatening to destroy kalebs life either did you you cant claim it was just your dad you were,AuthorB
an adult at the time you didnt give kaleb time to properly mourn his gf someone who he cared for and probably felt extremely guilty that he was the one who brought her to the dinner that ultimately killed her you wanted him to just forget about her and concentrate all his energy on you and when he didnt you and your dad tried to rush him along and when that didnt work and he lashed out you essentially had him run out of town stop looking for him if he wanted anything to do with you im sure he knows exactly where to find you i am extra careful around mirrors and will not walk under a ladder i always say you never know so ill follow the superstition just in case now i have to stop putting my pocketbook on the floor never heard that one have you been on any other lines and can you compare them im not too worried about the food im not a foodie so unless something,AuthorB
is clearly inedible im fine what was the sea day activities like and the night shows and casino oh and i also liked pic 4 are you a photographer because id never even think to take that shot yet its pretty great i think the earlier suggestion of seeing if any of the other people in these photos want them really nobody in the fam is going to want to look at them from a viewpoint of thats where aunt and uncle went and what did on their vacay but the friends they went with might want to relive those memories of course keep any that have no nudity in them landscapes signs etc so that youd have a timeline of their travels if anyone would really want to know just a thought i dont want to come off as mean but were you really tricked you really thought a 52 yo when he started dating you at 28 father of 3 adult children would have wanted to start all over again with a,AuthorB
baby some might but the majority wont he wanted to date a much younger woman to stroke his ego if you want a child do yourself a huge favor and find a man closer to your age who actually wants to have and be involved in raising his child oh great now well have to hear all about what they got wrong do these two really not have any sense of humor laugh it off once in a while they must be fun at parties you have a lot going on so i dont know if this will be helpful or not but i can say that my hot flashes have on occasion come on fast and i did have the dizziness and nausea so that symptom may well be connected to menopause sorry but i cant help with anything else weve all seen on reditt that some parents have an obvious favorite child those examples are i think more the exception than the rule most parents dont have a favorite but we recognize,AuthorB
that each child has something special or different that their sibs dont have one can talk to anyone anywhere and one takes a while to open up to new people one is an athlete and one is artistic ones a spender ones a saver those things and when we recognize these differences we try to cultivate and encourage that thing so the child can make the most of it for themselves so every child is the favorite if you want to call it that in a diff category at least thats how i saw and did it nta i think its perfectly fine for parents to go away without their kids but you are too young to be left alone for a week and its your parents responsibility to make arrangements for someone to take care of you for the week thats what makes your parents ta do you have a best friend that you can stay with you need to make your parents understand its the leaving you home alone that is not,AuthorB
right i say go for it you really have no idea what your personal menopause is going to be like some woman go through it with minimal effect on their life others are hit hard and have a difficult time just getting thru the day you dont know where youre going to fall in the range and youll regret not taking this opportunity if you have an easy or even a temporary short lived hard time surround yourself with one or two very key employees that you can absolutely trust to have your back just in case id give a student teacher a bit more leeway just because they are figuring out the best approach to a lesson but i agree the mentor teacher should have had a chat about the approach also keep in mind just in general teachers try to explain things in multiple ways to cover all the diff ways kids learn thats not a bad idea its repetitive for the ones that got it on the first explanation but invaluable,AuthorB
for the ones that got it on the last explanation im still not understanding you park your car on the street this is not a private parking lot or something is it is it correct to say that your car is not blocking their driveway but is parked between two driveways on the street so in front of a home are you parking in front of your neighbors house and thats why they are mad they do not own the street parking in front of their home can you not park in front of your own home i cannot imagine that a traffic officer would give you a ticket even if they have been called by the neighbor if you are not parked illegally how do you even call a traffic officer im not really sure what to tell you maybe take a picture of your car every time you park and then if you get a ticket take another pic with the ticket still on your car to prove the car was parked,AuthorB
legally or see if you have a case for harassment on the neighbor if they keep calling the traffic police on you or call the traffic police yourself and ask them why they keep coming when they know you are parking legally if you dont mind can you expand on the increase risk of cardio vascular disease please im trying to keep up but honestly its too much info thats constantly being contradicted day to day and not making a lot of sense i thought the heart issues came about from the vaccine and mostly in youngish people your gf is insane none of this is normal she knows her big v day gift is a play she got a smaller gift on v day to mark that day you asked what she wanted to do on that day and did it with her none of that was enough she still wanted you to acknowledge and recognize your past failure on gift giving occasions hell no your gf has a way over inflated opinion,AuthorB
of her worth how long or how many times are you going to have to atone for past grievances this is your first relationship so im gonna give you the benefit of the doubt since you have nothing to compare this one to but ill tell you this this is absolutely not how a mutual respectful and healthy relationship should play out you should not be tiptoeing around her trying not to upset her take a long hard look at what she adds to your life ill bet not much do you frequently feel as tho you arent doing enough do her wants and needs count for more than your own have you ever really wanted to do something or go somewhere that she didnt and you gave in simply put shes treating you like shit and youre taking it and asking for more please time to send her packing it could be as simple as keeping the good stuff he really had no reason to keep your clothes or nick nacks or he,AuthorB
just couldnt be bothered to pack it up and ship it even if you pay for him to ship it he may just keep the money and not ship it anyway dont read too much into it just write him and the keyboard off get yourself a new keyboard youre 2 months in it is totally unrealistic for her to be able to say whether she sees a future with you so early on is the honeymoon phase you and her need time in order to tell if this is a long term thing or not you have to really know the other person warts and all as the saying goes work on your anger issues and see how it goes dont pressure her to commit long term this early it comes off as insecure needy and obsessive she should have some idea that an engagement is in her future so its not out of the ordinary to scroll some websites together and see what she likes and doesnt like you can then ask,AuthorB
if she wants to pick out the exact one or if she trusts you enough to pick one on your own we never even discussed rings at all and i love mine i looked at it like he got what he wanted me to have she may want you to do that also just ask her i have to say that in this instance i cant imagine you would even want to see your father for a while due to your own anger at after the way he treated your mom and its not a taking sides thing its more the way he went about leaving her it was unnecessarily cruel of him so youre nta for limiting contact at least for a while until you get your own anger and disappointment under control after things settle down a bit you can reach out under your terms to either see him with the kids or maybe just even have your h at your home while he visits hugs to your mom are you that,AuthorB
busy that you cant look online and save some styles you like or just take a trip to a mall and look thru all the jewelry stores there to see what they have decide on a few styles you like go back to the jeweler and pick one theres no need for a middleman try to figure out why you are eating are you bored your life seems pretty active at school and when youre home youre probably bored you need to schedule more activity during the day or you can drink a glass of water every time you reach for food you might just be thirsty and if not it will at least fill you enough that you wont feel the need to eat right at that time also remember you arent burning as many calories at home that you do at school it may be that youre not even eating so many calories youre just not offsetting them with exercise but he expects you to have 23 hours to clean after looking,AuthorB
after the house and kids all day and going to school im not even sure what level of clean hes looking for i get making sure the guest bathroom is clean for company but you could dust on monday and by tuesday night its back not as much but its there the kids toys shouldnt be scattered around the house but thats a 5 min task ask him what exactly he thinks will take hours very very slight yta just for phrasing instead of saying normal moms you should have said something more along the lines of you knew we were going clubbing why didnt you have your h watch the baby for a few hours im assuming these were plans made in advance did she ever give a reason why her h couldnt watch the baby im thinking this has less to do with whether she was invited or not and more to do with her mindset she feels shes not back to her pre baby weight and has nothing to wear shes,AuthorB
has a mindset that moms dont do clubbing and shes tired so the last thing she wants to do is something active she just hasnt figured out a balance between being a mom and being her own person sometimes new moms get stuck in baby mode shes going to lose all her friends if she expects 7 other women are going to be happy with a social life that fully revolves around baby friendly activities so get more video proof id put cameras in every direction ones that can pick up sound so you have everything recorded you put up with it for a few years you can hang on another 6 months its not you but escalating isnt the way to go about it and you know the second you retaliate the cops will be showing up at your door you dont need that in your life think of it this way is it fair to the girl youre dating now to not be able to give her your all in this relationship,AuthorB
no its not you need to tell her whats going on she deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her completely its a new thing so she likely isnt too invested yet and you need to take some time to get over your old relationship without dating im not in this fight but i found this just because i was curious its from 2021 so i have no idea if it is was ever implemented also its from a womans forum so i was surprised by their stance i think theyre asking what have you been given that isnt sex because in a committed relationship sex will be happening its just worded oddly it cant be off the table and also given stay home make a nice dinner both agree to dress up for dinner something your so really likes that you wouldnt normally be comfortable going out in him too tho something you like to see him not thats not the usual open a bottle of wine and spend the,AuthorB
night connecting as a couple ah see i learned something new thanks for the diff between the two ah learned something new today thanks for the distinction excellent point this is a key distinction i perceive antisocial with being more aggressive maybe at or when meeting new people but someone who is or shy or introverted is just more uncomfortable amongst new people but willing to go out of their comfort zone to make new connections big diff in advice to be given they wont let you bring them on when you board and they will take them from you when you reboard and store them from you until the end of the cruise if you buy them in port so basically no but i heard if youre cruising europe you can bring alcohol on when boarding and also from ports that they will let you keep but you should confirm that get a library card and use their app to borrow ebooks for your kindle this way youre not paying for books you,AuthorB
might not like how about reading the book of a movie you enjoyed theres usually a lot more nuance in the book that you cant get from the movie and you already know you like the story that might make you more willing to set aside time to read no its fine but do you understand the point i was trying to explain trying to explain why trans ppl get more hate than just lgbq people what youre missing is the baker wouldnt make a cake for the lesbian couple because he was religious and said it goes against his religious and moral convictions idk anything about the gender one tho but im guessing probably the same reason but thats a guess its not a matter of not agreeingwith lgbtq at this point we all should know that there are people who have diff sexualities but trans ppl arent as simple as a diff sexuality they are in a whole other place having more to do with gender than sexuality so i think that,AuthorB
confuses people who dont understand how that can be so its as if they dont understand it it cant be true in a sense adding to that is young and really young kids claiming to be trans and all the medical treatments they are being given at such young ages doesnt sit well with a lot of people theres a feeling that its too much too soon is it right or wrong i have no idea then add in all the controversy of what bathroom to use sports competition moral issues like the baker and other businesses situation and it just becomes an us vs them fight and this is what were seeing now i liked it im not a huge fan i knew some of the songs i thought it was simple but at least for the most part it focused on her just doing what she was hired to do sing her songs i liked the floating platforms and the dancers around are were really good but i also dont like when,AuthorB
theres so much else going on that the main act kind of gets lost in the shuffle when theres too much going on all at once sometimes the camera is one place and other things are going on in other places that way you dont really see the whole production the problem i see is that youve only been with your bf a few months you admit yourself that you do not know him well enough or know enough about him that you need to know and this is why you never should have met his kids if you start to know the things you need to and do not like what you learn and leave those kids will be sad and confused but im also confused about something is he a single dad because he seems to have his kids every day with an hour to spare to see you where is the kids mom was this how it was when you first met why cant you spend the evenings at his house,AuthorB
and spend time with him after his kids go to sleep why would you even ever entertain the thought of sleeping with someone elses boyfriend this is just plain wrong you are old enough to know that this is the cardinal rule nobody should have to tell you this stop hanging out with him alone and getting drunk no good will ever come from this he may sleep with you but hes going back to his gf thats a bit harder to fix because its an issue for you but to him its not really an issue can you maybe schedule a few days a week i know it sounds so stupid to have to schedule your sex life but at least both of you are on the same page and sometimes it works just by the anticipation also keep in mind would you rather have sex for the sake of having it or would you rather have really good sex sometimes quality over quantity also maybe dont put too much pressure on him,AuthorB
start with 2 times a week and work up to 3 or however many works but you should start to figure out if you can be in this relationship more long term youve already spent 7 years and its not easy to leave when theres so much good but you dont want it to get to a point where your resentment takes over either if its a matter of frequency then he doesnt see it as a problem because he thinks his sex drive is perfectly ok and it is its just that yours and his do not match if its more a matter of what youre doing together you need to ask why he isnt willing to experiment some people just dont like some sex acts and really shouldnt be made to do them if it isnt their thing you matched with her first but your bro was texting with her before you started dating how did that even happen you both must have been at the very least texting or talking with,AuthorB
her at the same time and how did you find out bro was talking to her look if you dont see moving forward with her just let her go why drag it out any longer so does your ex usually pick your son up at 9pm so he can sleep at dads everything about this is just off you pay your ex child support but you have him all day do yourself a favor and split custody with the ex 5050 no one pays child support and then youll have time for your bf so dont give her access to all the money sit her down and show her your finances take the 4800 for the month minus all your household bills by now you have an idea what the variable ones avg out to food etc take the net thats left and left decide how much goes into emergency fund long term savings and depending on whats left decide on a weekly amount she can use for herself open separate accounts for the,AuthorB
emergency savings and one for her money leaving is impulsive she doesnt work and you have two small kids your finances are not going to be better supporting a separate household for yourself and paying alimony maybe and child support you say all hell breaks loose when you discuss money just tell her she can bitch and moan all she wants its still not going to change the fact that she is being irresponsible where was your mom for those 2 hours you should not have to sleep in the spare room unless you want to or your gf is so sickly contagious that its dangerous for you to be in your shared bed how long could it possibly take you to hang one load of laundry and in that time your gf went upstairs got ready for bed and also fell asleep oh and conveniently sometimes puts her glasses on your side of the bed so its a guess each night either she was not sleeping yet and purposely set you up to,AuthorB
have a fight or she was sleeping and got unreasonably mad when you came to bed and woke her she really couldnt just wait for you to come up and you go to bed together thats pretty selfish in this instance considering she knew you were coming up pretty much right after her the thing you need to remember is this when we start to date we have no idea what were doing were all fumbling around trying to figure out this whole bfgf thing so we date and we break up a lot mostly with no rhyme or reason who knows what your bf is thinking but dating you just isnt working for him anymore doesnt mean you did anything wrong stop being sad look at this as a learning lesson the lesson is enjoy it while it lasts take a day or two to mourn it and move on but that doesnt mean on to yet another boy just for the sake of having a boy this too shall pass most people,AuthorB
realize that the 2 party system the us has is not working i think mainly because theres an us vs them mentality most elected officials dont think for themselves and just go along with party lines thats not to say they dont personally agree with some issues but it is unrealistic to think one person agrees with every single platform either party has and third party candidates have mostly been one off random candidates from one state here and there thats why the third party is looked at as a water vote that out of the way how does this sound a third party but with candidates in every state where an election is being held with a pretty centrist platform take the most popular stances of each issue and endorse that or whatever it is national elections take place every evennumbered year every four years the president vice president onethird of the senate and the entire house are up for election onyear elections on evennumbered years when there isnt a presidential election onethird,AuthorB
of the senate and the whole house are included in the election offyear elections so next year this third party could have people running who could theoretically change the whole look of all branches of govt im not gonna explain this correctly so bear with me how do we do this we let people in every state know that we have ppl running in all the diff states so me in state a can say i want to vote for party 3 and id like their agenda to be implemented i know one person from my state cant do anything alone but if a countrywide campaign can be implemented with a message of this party can get a majority of representatives we can implement our platform it might make people rethink the wasted vote of a third party could be that you just dont have an actual sexual attraction to that person her being good looking isnt really the only criteria maybe you need to have an emotional attraction to a partner as well,AuthorB
sex is sometimes as much emotional as physical and just wash your hands and clean under your fingernails for me its not about trying to hold the family together its more the nephew is too angry for an 11 year old and i recognize that all is not well somewhere in his life it could be his mom has poisoned him against his dad and his fam it could be theres more to the story between his mom and dad that even the op doesnt know it could simply be that nephew is a troubled child but whatever the reason if he grows and gets to a place where he wants to make amends with his dads family he will have the knowledge that they always wanted him around and never actively excluded him thats just my take if nephew wouldnt show up anyway you might as well extend the invite it keeps the peace with your brother and if nephew ever realizes that this side of the fam is decent you can always,AuthorB
say that he was included and he never took you up on it but if you can schedule on moms weekend youd be better off as an aside im still confused how his mom wanted nothing to do with the father of her childs family what did she want to happen shed raise the child alone and dad would just be ok with that dad needs to get some some help so the boy can stop being so angry nta its your money that you earned its not as if you spend some of it youre putting an undue burden on your parents the fact is even with a full scholarship there are day to day expenses that you need money for coffee with friends a movie gasetc why dont you explain this to your mom and ask for a monthly amount dont divide all the money you have so its gone by the last month of school just try to figure out a nominal amount that you can get by with youll have,AuthorB

try to save a bad relationship laid out like this obviously the division of labor is wildly unfair im curious tho how did it get like this you didnt just move in and you were doing the lions share was it a gradual tapering off of them doing less and less did partner start out as a sahp which if chores went undone it wasnt a big deal cause child care and rearing take a lot of time but then did they just get used to not doing much this was me but any mention by my partner that things werent getting done caused some small level of guilt like i wasnt holding up my end of the bargain i wasnt being a good partner but thats just me you need a serious sit down with your partner does partner have any health issues that may be contributing in any way do they have a hobby that theyre dedicating all their time to and in a very non accusatory way you need to ask,AuthorB

to be friends with a jobless drunk regardless of how long the friendship has been yta im really curious why you adopted this child to begin with you already had one son when you adopted and went on to have another so its not a case of thinking you couldnt get pregnant and then miraculously did and she was no longer your only hope for a family as some may think its pretty obvious she isnt treated as a d but as an adopted d she is your oldest child why didnt she get a car and pay for her school even if she got some scholarship you think she had to take loans so why didnt you just pick up the difference do you really think she does not know that shes the not wanted child shes a part of this family in name only i wonder if you did her any favors by adopting her she would have been better off with a family that wanted to give her an actual living,AuthorB

is it possible that hes starting to think that hes leaving his 70 yo mom alone and thats why hes pushing for her to go idk if he has siblings left behind that can look after mom if she needs it has he explained why he doesnt think your mom and sister cant be trusted to come with you thats an odd thing to say is he afraid your mom and sis wont contribute financially to the renting of the property because apparently his mom wont be and hes worried it will all fall to you guys so maybe instead of renting both homes as a unit you can each get separate rental agreements on your and their home so you and h wont be on the hook if they decide not to hold up their end idk just throwing out ideas its not what they do or say its what they do or say in that moment if they shut down someone being rude snarky or harassing the first time it happens that,AuthorB

this info was available but i took a shot and googled it cost 726 per person plus another 3675 for the ship so if we divide the 3675 by the number of passengers idk what ship so lets say 3000 passengers that comes to 012 cents per person so 726 plus 02 thats 728 per person the 10 credit per person works as far as a refund for port fees ncl gave you a credit to your shipboard acct instead of a direct credit to your original form of payment the only problem i see is in the future which most people dont think about hes going to get to a point where he slows down and you wont be able to do some things together think of the activities you do now with him as a 45 yo when you are 45 hell be closer to 60 hes not going to have the energy for it then dont discount his health you may find yourself being his carer and thats not an easy,AuthorB
thing to do if youre in the midst of a career or are raising youngish kids or both at the same time i know 2 couples with at least a 15 year gap and the men are both facing health issues and their wives are of course doing what needs to be done but being a 50 something and scheduling your life around doctors and tests is not fun and neither has any kids just something to think about she just started a new job and believe it or not its a difficult one not just physically but mentally and add to that the fact that im sure shes stressed to no end wondering if shes doing this job right all that combined is a recipe for exhaustion she needs time time to feel like shes on a good footing with the job time to build the confidence she needs to go into school every day knowing shes doing a good job time to learn all those shortcuts that veteran teachers know that cuts,AuthorB
her at home work down what she needs is a supportive bf who is willing to deal with this transition period of her life because he wants to support her to succeed she doesnt need a needy bf who jumps to a dating app the second his gf doesnt give him the amount of attention he wants id love to see what happens next year when youre up to your eyeballs in textbooks and lack of sleep and she wants you to hang out are you going to put off studying to hang out i didnt think so frankly you dont deserve her youre too selfish yta i am failing to see what is so wrong with him putting the ring in his mouth its really not a big deal nta its a perfectly normal question to ask your friend is hiding something let me guess they met online and are long distance and he never actually met her just passing on what i saw the cd was in ops name effectively making it,AuthorB
the legal property of op grandma verbally told op to give that one cd to nephew op emailed nephew nephew took a year to answer and then asked for gold op told nephew whyd it take you so long but ok ill send the check but the original cd was cashed and spent in expenses so the is coming from me personally nephew responds give me my money it shouldnt take this long oh and send it to my dad ops lawyer advised since the cd was never in nephews name nor was the cd or nephew mentioned in grandmas will op legally doesnt have to give nephew any money i think i heard costa rica mentioned but idk where i got that from so its not very helpful and theres nothing on the costa rica reditt either so im starting to think there isnt another one i saw a retired military somebody on fox dont slam me they carried the shoot down live who said biden wanted to shoot it down on wed,AuthorB
and the military talked him out of it this guy made a point of saying biden needs to have a little sit down with those guys and explain the chain of command so i think theres more to this whole incident than we know yes i keep trying to find one news source about that balloon i cant find anything other than a blip that said us military was aware of one very strange this is what youre unhappy about he doesnt tell you youre cute or pretty every day he doesnt call you by your nickname he doesnt ask you how youre doing he hasnt asked you on a date since fall he says hes not good at planning you have not once said what it is that you do for him that you should be appreciated for im sorry but you seem a bit insecure are you not confident in the fact that your bf likes your looks and wants to spend time with you that might be why youre going through,AuthorB
rough patches you expect him to act and be a certain way without thinking that maybe thats just not him its easy to be so enamored in the beginning and then it tapers off thats not to say he should never give you compliments or plan something but you want him to do all the work why cant you plan a date so see youre doing fine youre covering all scenarios and logically thinking things through just pay close attention over the next say 6 months if hes serious about you there is no reason you cannot start meeting his kids slowly at first and gradually to where you all can spend weekend time together thats a big tell to me about his intentions ooh his wife asked for the divorce ill throw this out just cause i want you to think about things you wouldnt think of some men just cannot be alone his wife ending things regardless of how he felt about you may have prematurely moved this relationship forward and im,AuthorB
not saying he wants back with her im sure there were signs his marriage was in trouble im not saying this is true but roll that little nugget around a bit ok so i think it may have been much easier for you coming out of a marriage that you and your ex had already realized was over to go all in with the new guy as opposed to him who im gonna guess sort of blindsided his wife with the divorce to an extent so hes dealing with guilt of hurting the ex guilt about the kids while also trying to move on with you its been a year so hes probably getting closer to the point of no guilt and ready to move on and maybe knowing this trip was always going to be coming up which really was a stupid thing to do the parents havent been together for a year why make this trip why not just one of the parents take the kids why this charadehas hampered his moving,AuthorB
on but the trip will be done he has no more reason to not wrap up his divorce and be all in also realize that his kids will always always cone first you will not have what you did in your marriage where its just the two of you and you can make plans on the fly and just go and be plans will be ruined if theres an issue with the kids and you have to be ok with that its the kiss of death if a relationship if you cannot handle all that if after this trip he is not willing to have you meet the kids then id reassess his true intentions but for the next few days while hes gone do something for yourself to occupy your time it might be better if you two dont talk so much a check in is enough you dont want to get jealous and he doesnt want to temper what he says to you and another excellent point to make this thread is,AuthorB
so fascinating with all the ins and outs something about this whole scenario just isnt sitting right with me info please hes separated yes as in living apart but not with you from his soon to be ex wife seeing his kids whenever the custody is they agree on oh and there was no cheating by either of you then i can weigh in better id agree with that if china had relayed that info before this balloon was spotted so they have a few weather balloon malfunctions possible if theyre trying something new and perfectly reasonable but just come out and say that before it enters into another countrys airspace if they want to be believed they have to be transparent about it even then we know the conspiracy theorists would be out in full force but until it comes down or gets forced down we wont know what it actually is and even then we might not ever be told the full extent of its capabilities as i originally said i would,AuthorB
have believed it was a weather balloon that went off course except that once it veered off and was clearly going to be entering close to or into another countrys airspace any country china should have said just that instead they said nothing now its possible they tried to play that story with either the us or canadian govt before it was spotted by whoever spotted it first but neither govt has said that was the case being that they didnt just leads me to believe that it wasnt just a wayward science balloon not to mention that theres another one and this one just traversed the country and is now over the carolinas where i believe we have large military bases could be wrong theres no doubt that most govts dont trust china but them being transparent about it would have gone a very long way to minimize the evil china theories ill believe the us and canada before i believe anything china says and thats just based in history not just anti,AuthorB

keeping your door open the first week or so is a good way i guess the more extroverted ppl pop their head in to say hi idk then you join a club or a team or volunteer to do something and you meet others that way eventually you find the few that you really click with and they become your closer friends you should have been leary of a guy who seeks you out and professes to have a crush when hes never even met you that screams scam to me you dont say how long youve been together but i would delay moving in yes we all did but youve been with him for 2 years that alone should be enough to be able to say that you trust him if you do not then why on earth would you have moved in with him you have to decide if you trust him or not because he is not going to put up with your constant insecurity forever thats not how a relationship,AuthorB

apology from me ever for anything she is a horrible mom you need a little chat with dad about what she said nta im not sure where she lives when shes not at yours so she can either remain there every day shes not spending time with her bf or she gives it up and moves in with her partner and pays her share of expenses its one thing to spend time with a so its another when shes there for days at a time theres no reason she should be freeloading off you three you need a roommate meeting and she either moves in or is only there when bf is there and if shes visiting she doesnt get to crank the ac eat whatever she wants or treat it like its her home not that she can hang around all day while hes at work someone correct me if im wrong please and ill delete this i think the point is that piers got fired from what i think was a pretty,AuthorB
big morning news show when he dared to say probably amongst other things that he didnt believe what m claims so the fact that he was in a sense markled lost his livelihood and now hes back because he has an interview with the pm which is a big deal a couple of things off the top of my head if you can wait until after labor day a lot more states schools are back in session which might cut down the number of kids idk how big the ship you mentioned is but i would avoid any mega ship if your wife doesnt like crowds id stay with somewhere around 3000 people or less there may be less gimmicky things like rock walls or go carts or whatever riyal has we just returned from a carnival cruise out of miami and there were a bunch of lgbt couples and groups i dont know if it was the ship celebration very big or the port or that ccl has lgbt meet ups on all,AuthorB
their ships which is attractive to the demographic but i didnt see or hear anything disparaging i realize im one person so that doesnt mean much this might cone off the wrong way but i dont know how else to put it so please forgive if it offends its absolutely not my intention idk if royal had a dedicated meet up but it might help to meet people like you and your wife see this part i didnt know how to phrase who you can be comfortable hanging out with and sort of have your own gang of friends who are accepting i know people hate carnival but ive been on them and ncl and really enjoy both lines carnival has really fun deck parties id go back anyway i cant possibly have another accident right yup im going with that we have 3 more booked for later this year but yeah it seems they arent gonna bill me which works for me saves me from dealing with the insurance company seriously needing evac,AuthorB
is my absolute worst fear being so badly hurt that they want me off the ship is terrifying yeah had to do the report also they even took pics of my sneakers which i sort of understand in a weird way i would like to think its so they can see if theres a pattern to where and how accidents happen idk thats what i was thinking since it happened on the ship sounds like me hurt on day 2 it def put a damper on the vacation im sorry your dad went thru that its scary when youre away from home and dealing with medical issues thats what i expected to happen its just really odd that they havent charged me yet i have allianz also so its good to know that it wont be a nightmare if i do have to claim oh yeah i def misunderstood your comment sorry ill just wait and see what happens that is my worst fear and the reason for the outside travel insurance it covers,AuthorB
the usual trip cxl and delay lost baggage etc but i got it mainly for medical and evacuation i tripped and fell on stairs and broke my ankle so really not their fault not my fault just a misstep i wasnt tipsy and was wearing sneakers it was just a freak thing they did tell me upfront that they dont take insurance which i knew and what all the charges would be for the doc and xrays after that i didnt really care what the charge was for the cast just do what needs to be done i did have to speak to security for an accident report maybe that has some bearing also idk i figured theyd put it on my ship acct because they didnt ask for my cc i guess ill just keep waiting to see if maybe they direct charge my cc at some point its been 6 days since i went to medical but only 2 days since debark thanks yeah my bill will def be higher than that,AuthorB
so it cant be a threshold thing i was expecting a charge to show up on my acct but it never did weird nailed it in one perfect im a bit confused what exactly is he doing that is making you feel bad the only clue i got was you feel uncomfortable and or unwanted by him is this a result of the pregnancy is it a weight issue or what no way in hell would i ever see any doctor that sil has seen or is her babies primary doctor that will only give her more ammunition you have no idea if what shes telling you is really what her dr had said her baby is small she has to find something to brag about both these babies are under a year old do i believe her baby is some super specimen of muscles idk i guess its possible will he continue on that same path who knows dont engage her at all if she makes any kind of off comment ask her,AuthorB
straight up what shes trying to say put her on the spot,AuthorB

can actually do is not be a distraction or support for your parents minimize your own engagement with your brother dont pick fights or take sides shrug and tell your parents if they dont like it change it let them suffer with the results of their own choices that is the only thing that might someday motivate them to change those choices you want a family that includes children and she doesnt stop trying to fix her or cure her or save her and just admit this relationship doesnt meet your needs its very sad but its not very complicated i love him on a deeper level than who he is now and who he has been and can be then you love a fantasy youve concocted for yourself about him not the person and youre going to do yourself harm trying to enforce that fantasy onto a real person its normal after just a few weeks to be grieving and to still be holding on to all sorts of fantasies and illusions but,AuthorC
its time to start doing the work of letting go because letting go isnt something that just magically happens it actually takes a bit of thoughtful effort and selfcare to do if you dont do the work you stagnant and get bitter dont keep such an open mind that brain falls right out this man was never really offering you a secure and healthy connection dont hold on so tightly to a dream that you lose sight of your own reality the reality is the romantic relationship is over and should be this is not transparency and you know it this is abuse this was immediately invasive and controlling abusive this is not just projection and not just intense this is just straightup abuse you have already correctly understood that nothing will satisfy him he doesnt just want full access he wants free rein to abuse you calling your contacts abuse complaining about the bathroom door abuse youre not wrong youre not concerned enough you cannot let this man continue to access you or,AuthorC
your children change all your password lock him out of everything you can and then break up with him no history of cheating but history of forgetting to let my dog out or leaving him home too long when he has been drinking caught him doing this once thanks to cameras so hes right you want to be able to see him you want the cameras in your shared home to check up on a 55yearold mans inability to care for your pet as agreed to the cameras are to some extent so you can check up on him and he doesnt like that because he already has shown he wont meet expectations when it comes to the dog come on youre 35 what are you doing with a 55yearold man who cannot be trusted to let a dog out without the risk of being caught or facing consequences either date someone who isnt a shithead or drop the cameras and just hire a dog walker no you either move forward from the infidelity,AuthorC
or you dont a hall pass will never be the equivalent and will only introduce more shame anger and resentment for one or both of you if you want to discuss opening up your relationship generally thats a whole different thing but a hall pass after infidelity is nothing but a toxic shitstorm if youre not going to leave then youre not leaving a monogamous relationship which means youre also not fucking anyone else she gets to have her reasons and any reason is good enough to leave a relationship she doesnt want to be in a relationship isnt a hostage situation it doesnt mean you did anything wrong or that you need to change if that is what she believed about you then its best you two not be dating no sir i feel quite uninclined to be kidnapped by an utter stranger today and likely have my entire financial and social future ruined in the process in fact even this conversation could materially damage the only currency i have to ensure my,AuthorC
basic survival so i must say good morrow to you if your gf is responsible for the childcare of your children at any time you need to clearly communicate those times to her and gain her agreement to that labour you cannot make her responsible for your basic health that is still your job and you cannot just sit and resent her for living her life as if she is not a parent shes not not unless that is your agreement togeather and shes offering child care support if shes living with you and the children and not offering any consistent supervisory support then you need to ask yourself if this partnership actually works for your life and your children but shes still not required to be your coparent her responsibilities if she has any for supervising the children without you needed to be hammered out before you moved in together or they can be discussed now but you cannot force your gf to be mommy or to be a free baby sister unless,AuthorC
she wants to be youre not being too sensitive but your expectation have been misplaced this is a problem youre going to need to solve probably with outside supports you can think shes a bad person or you can break up with her but you cannot make her babysit your kids youre wrong for continuing to imagine this person is your friend they are very clearly not this sounds like a bad habit not a relationship break the habit before it does you real harm do you want have kids because this man is telling you straight up that every single unpleasant part of parenting will be your job he will not be changing diapers let alone his plans he might show up for the big game but he will not be part of the weekly practice carpool he doesnt put himself out for others at all not even those he claims to love the most the people who love him do the work to keep the relationship operating and he basically ignores that,AuthorC
labour entirely its one thing to know your own boundaries and limitations its another to be an asshole you know which this is i wouldnt date a person this immature and self centred at all but if you want children you need to run screaming from a 32 year old who is less considerate and empathetic than most 12 year olds youre 36 i dont believe youre actually this clueless you have not been subtle at all you know damn well this woman is working hard to establish distance and keep the conversation professional sometimes there is no chance to kill its just not happening accept it and move on at this point marriage is kind of a strange place to draw the line whats with the sudden attack of sensible concerns where was this hesitation fours years ago obama said people have the right to be skeptical of the dumb shit when minority candidates say it too attacked obama didnt even bother saying the numbnuts name he just didnt want to date you,AuthorC
there is nothing you can do to change that sooner you accept that the sooner you can start to heal this guy is closed off and noncommunicative thats not on you you couldnt fix that for him frankly sounds like he tried for blame you for emotional issues that were of his own making you fucked her sister youre not that dumb kiddo youre just playing at it to dodge responsibility for your actions and their predicable reasonable impact seems like a pattern you should apologize for laughing your friends were insulting and bullying her and you joined in you should have found something kind to say to her also you fucked her sister yeah thats the kind of thing that is gonna keep coming up kinda a big deal dont play dumb no one is that dumb has she actually told you she would like an apology or is she just vagueposting because you are well within your rights to completely ignore vagueposting if she has asked for an apology this is one,AuthorC
of those few situations where im sorry you felt that waysorry you had a bad time apology would be valid and maybe worthwhile you didnt do anything wrong but you can still acknowledge that she was uncomfortable and that being uncomfortable sucked for her you can acknowledge it sucks to feel ditched even while you disagree that is what took place wanting to be heard and have her feelings acknowledged may be reasonable anything more than that is not if she needs more than being heard out then this isnt a person to hang out with during these sorts of events and thats good for you to know in the future this man just accused you of being manipulative even emotionally abusive because he didnt want to take any accountability for his own choices or his own frustrations you knew he was doing you a big favour you said so more than once you went out of your way to explain what the situation would look like and then he weaponized the situation you,AuthorC
had perfectly explained to him if he were saying man i did not enjoy that dont think id offer to do that again that would be perfectly fine and completely valid ive definitely done a few favors for partners and then said ok i know i agreed to that and was happy to help this time but not again but that isnt what hes saying dont build a life with someone who cannot handle their own choices or normal human frustrations like bad traffic without making it your fault without twisting it into a bad thing that you or someone else did to them the first time a person blames me for traffic or weather or their own regrets or their own ability to say no to something is the last time life is full of little disappointments and bad calls and unexpected hiccups of all levels of seriousness adults who pout and blame and accuse only make the situation 100x worse and are impossible to live happily with if this is true and,AuthorC
youre really back asking this again then you need therapy stop asking for advice and speak to a therapist about your habit of fixating and unhealthy desperation to snag man hes asserting control and trying to establish a norm hes saying my passing humour is more important than your discomfort its probably not that he wants to sabotage the marriage its that he wants to make sure she is accepting of this sort of lowkey abuse before the marriage so he can continue to escalate afterwards thats the kind of marriage he wants to build stay away from kay and keep getting support for your alcoholism kay probably has some rather valid anger with you at this point start drinking in moderation would have been the point at which i would be totally done with your shit the fact she disclosed more than she should while standing in the er concerned you might die is not necessarily malicious but poor judgment that is a moment where people make poor judgements like that and speaking,AuthorC
with a 19 year olds parents about them being in danger is also not necessarily malicious but it doesnt matter if youre not happy with how kay speaks of you stop sharing information with kay otherwise you cannot really control her experiences or behaviours and this seems rather obviously not your biggest fish to fry at the moment kay doesnt like your choices you dont like hers let it go and do the work you need too good luck you cant control what other people think dont bother trying but people would have to be rather stupid to think there is a problem with this you share no blood you were not raised as family members youre adults who met one another as adults through other family members youre only real risk here is the occasional awkward large family dinner this guy is your controlling cheating ex hes not a friend you dont owe him any explanations block him everywhere never speak to him again problem solved it is possible to use grooming in,AuthorC
any relationship friends coworkers other family members the word isnt actually restricted to minorsagerelated power imbalances it refers to a technique or group of tactics not to children however i do agree this seems to be op trying to minimize his wifes role in this situation id tell my bf he aint subtle and to grow the hell up its rude and embarrassing to be out with a man who gawks if any of my male friends did this on the regular id tell them they look like idiot 13 year olds and to get a grip we all glance we all notice it had nothing to do with you or your appearance stop taking it personally and just call this ogling what it is rude and childish like picking your nose in public draw his attention to it just like you would if he was picking his nose tell him its gross and to break the bad habit this man is just an asshole he understands just fine this isnt a situation where,AuthorC
you havent communicated clearly he knows this isnt loving your misery is the point youre regularly reviewing straights mens dating profiles eh i dont spend a lot of time looking at straight womans profiles but obviously that behaviour about height would make her an asshat really not complicated also totally not necessary on apps where filtering by height is available but hey ill take your word for it kiddo im sorry im not hating on teenage women enough for ya but i am confident youll find plenty of corners of the internet which fuel that fire for ya i know this a repost but i still wanna see this asshat thread an overlocker my gaming computer requires way less regular maintenance or technical knowhow than my sewing machines men are policed for their behaviour not their preferences you can choose not to match with larger women on a dating site but if you put no fatties youre an ass if you are 40 and chasing 19 year olds its your behaviour thats the problem,AuthorC
i dont expect you to understand the difference but there is a drastic one between preferences and behaviour towards other human beings according to this guy hes basically required to be it cannot be some woman have personal values interests or concerns about the world that extend beyond an individual mans needs because as much as they whine about respecting fathers and the necessity of two parent households they only really mean that women shouldnt be allowed to leave they never actually mean that individual men should be responsible parents i dont think its the end of the world if someones wants to be an older father yes there are increased risks and sure youre probably not gonna be around for highschool grad i think that sucks but it falls under you do you what really bugs me in the men who will both argue for the importance of present fathers in a childs life and still applaud these sorts of choices while i think your concerns are totally valid we also know perfectly,AuthorC
well that many many people can engage daily with all sorts of immersive fantasies games movies books and still not be confused about what is real and what is content consumption i think the real question you need to ask yourself is if you are compatible with and comfortable in a relationship with someone who engages with porn this much is he pressuring you to perform or not respecting your nos when it comes to sex acts you dont need to judge his character negatively or make calls about his motivations to decide hes just not for you this is really up to you is this the behaviour you want to have in a friendship because ill be honest not me this kind of intensity of communication is reserved for romantic partners andor very close friends at times of crisis since youre asking this question youre probably realizing that your energy and time are not lining up with the reality of this connection your behaviour is not consistent with what you say is happening,AuthorC
here between the two of you it wouldnt be wrong it wouldnt be a violation of your agreement but it would probably be unwise at this point if youre serious about exploring the connection with him he has told you that for him he tends not to explore his options by this point youre not exclusive but he has told you that is the path he would like to be on ive been similar to him in the past by the time i reach date number six or so im probably not actively dating anyone else even if we are not exclusive yet frankly if youre at date six and youre still motivated to explore your options with other people then you may want to respectfully end it with someone who is looking for a serious commitment you may just not be aligned youre only the bad guy if youd not clear with her when you know what the score is shes allowed to be upset shes allowed to not want to be your,AuthorC
friend it may suck but its not wrong you dont really explain its not a math puzzle you can logically describe for her you just own it to be kind you have to be clear youre a cool person but im not feeling it on a romance level id like to stay friends if that would work for you its okay for her to feel bad rejection sucks shes allowed to be upset what is important is that you own it as your own experience and reality and you dont leave any false hope you desperately need to find yourself a woman mentor who can help you set expectations for the review process youre spinning out write romance novels on your own time in the real world your boss is offlimits and youre running a real risk of making a fool of yourself on a personal level with him and with others these fantasies and obsessive thoughts need to be dropped the only actual workplace problem here is you learning what is normal during,AuthorC
the pitchfeedbackrevision process and how to emotionally navigate it let go of the rest of this shit its a new sleeping situation for you both youll both probably adapt or buy a bigger bed the only spin here to help her feel better is that she is now free of someone who clearly was unable or unwilling to treat her with any consideration or real friendship youre reading too much into this because reading into is a waste of time and energy its over you may want to consider what boundaries you need as her friend when it comes to constantly hearing about this drama how can you not understand her being perfectly allowed to just talk about work with you it is sad but it also sounds like her husband may have had valid concerns about your ability to manage an appropriate workplace friendship with a married woman you do not appear to handling this change in boundaries very well i dont think we need to attribute to malice what is adequately explained,AuthorC
by stupidity i doubt he was consciously running game or trying to manipulate you probably just wasnt thinking very much at all and was doing what felt good to him in the moment with no actual regard for you as another person no self awareness no consideration just hey this feels good to me in this moment so ill do x definitely not someone who is worth carrying in with way too dumb to be any fun i would have blocked him too after that shit but also probably not someone who was deliberately trying to mess with you also too dumb its not her fault youre terrible at confrontation if you cannot handle telling the woman whose done your hair for six years that you werent happy with the latest job then you will just need to find another demanding a refund at this point seems excessive when you werent able to communicate with her its strange that after six years youre allowing so much accusation and anger to fester you dont you,AuthorC

is the rational reaction to your behaviour your wife is behaving in a totally logical way you fucked her teenage sister youre done if you try to continue to attempt to entrap very young women they are going to keep on growing up and getting what they are entitled to from you i cant stand watching people walk all over her then stop watching because you cannot change her choices you can only change yours and you are not reflecting much trust of respect for her choices here which means this is a bad relationship for you both this relationship isnt working for you your insistence on remaining in a bad situation is going to result in you behaving in toxic and controlling ways tell him hes 30 dont coddle him tell him i am worried youre going to keep making it my job to reassure you of your value comments like youll get swooped up or i have a lot of competition are really insulting to me since i have chosen to date,AuthorC
you i have already decided that you won sp i need these sorts of comments to stop not just to apologize when you do it but to work on not doing it i need you to know that your insecurities are primarily your responsibility i can help you out a bit with it but you need to do the real work to stop thinking this way about yourself and stop putting it on me that you feel these negative ways about yourself its fair to keep putting on me and making it my job to address youre not a superhero youre not a martry youre not her parent or her keeper or her therapist or her doctor youre her teenage boyfriend and shes it sounds like shes been telling you to stop condescending to her youre not in charge of her and its not your job to figure things out for her she is allowed to make choices for her own life even if she has a mental illness she can and is choosing,AuthorC
not to be in the kind of relationship you want to be in you are allowed to leave a relationship that doesnt work for you you cannot earn the relationship you want with someone they have to be offering it shes not offering you the kind of relationship you want to be in support your dad in this moment let your mom make her own decisions the only mistake here you made here was every agreeing to attend with you mother it always made sense to prioritize your father on this day it was understandable for her to feel awkward attending alone but that wasnt a problem you can solve youd already made plans with your dad besides that you really need to tell all of these very selfish adults to handle their own shit if your father isnt happy with how his mother maintains boundaries with his exwife that is something for him to discuss with his mother not you if he doesnt want your mother to join in events besides the funeral,AuthorC
itself that is for him to discuss with her or with other people who may choose to invite her like his own mother and not you if your mother sends a nasty text that is none of your business tell both of them not to speak to you about it you shouldnt even have to know about that both of your parents sound petty and mean and are putting way too much of their bullshit on you its been a decade its not your problem to solve these two people are choosing misery and pettiness at this point and you cannot make them happy they have both chosen to some degree unhappiness youre an adult but youre still the child when it comes to the two of them do not do anyones dirty work for them these adults are still responsible for managing their own relationships with one another do not try to save your dad from your mom or your mom from your dad tell them to talk to one another if they,AuthorC
have a problem with one another and leave you the hell out of it youve made your decision to attend with dad your mom can feel how she feels about that and do what she feels is right if shes not comfortable attending tell her you understand and youll talk again soon beyond that its between them dont get involved your mother cannot force you to get a medical implant or go on birth control if you tell the doctor you do not want it they will do put it in you you only have to say so your mother can create serious consequences for you that might stop you from sleeping over at your bfs house but she cannot force you to use hormonal contraception but come on you know this relying only on condoms is a little bit stupid when other options are available the smart thing to do would be to figure out if hormonal birth control is something you can comfortably use youre digging in your heels because youre pissed,AuthorC
with your mom she can be wrong about a whole lot of shit and also be right that its time to explore contraception options in your life go talk to a doctor about it its feminine im only half kidding my little brother called it feminine anger shrill irrational and intensely emotional is what he thinks a womans anger should be preformed as which is strange because he comes from a family full of women who are quite mellow but have ice cold rage when triggered there were no shrill voices growing up and my house and ive seen that he comprehends it just fine this woman needs better friends although she probably cant keep em with that attitude ive never met the woman who behaves the way shes describing like i havent even had to work very hard to avoid her theoretical evil woman i have had to avoid women like this content creator who scream bloody murder about the evil women they imagine exist and are treating men so badly does dressing,AuthorC
modestly mean trying your damnedest to look like an airbrushed 12 year old now the first thing you do is accept that you dont have sole control over how peaceful it is if he chooses to react very poorly thats going to happen no amount of perfect behaviour on your part can stop him and hes probably going to react badly because hes already told you he feels entitled to verbally abuse you he doesnt think its wrong hes gonna do it your job is to minimize his opportunities to leave in the shortterm you need someplace safe for you and your daughter to stay since he is abusive you should make a plan that keeps you safe that means your daughter needs to not be in the house or accessible to him in anyway when you tell him you also want to remove anything highly personal or sensitive before you have this conversation passports medical records sentimental jewelry or banking information leave it with friends or family do not leave it behind in,AuthorC
a space where he can access it you can absolutely have this conversation over the phone you do not owe a facetoface conversation to someone who is abusive towards you safety first then you probably need some legal advice regarding leases or entitlements but the first step is physical safety and basic core documents and possessions do you think this is because she actually has an issue with old problems that again she have not been brought up in years or because she is deflecting back to her its almost certainly both to some degree or another even without knowing what they are both probably both she is actually still having these issues and the feelings remain real and are impacting her even if you think the issue itself is resolved and also shes deflecting and feeling defensive and unhappy with you just take these conversations to a therapist who can help you both handle them better in other words because misogyny many men do not believe it is possible for me as a,AuthorC
bisexual woman to experience a connection with another woman that is as meaningful as the connection that is possible with them a man which is extremely invalidating it is extremely insulting and demeaning on a personal level to be treated that way by someone who is close to you who you speak openly to about yourself and your life it means they are not listening or believing me when i speak about my own experiences romantic and sexual history or orientation i dont want a partner who invalidates my lived experience because their ego and sexist assumptions cannot accept that two women have real sex or real romance oh well if he started it that changes nothing grow the fuck up you dont need to date anyone you do not want to but you need to check yourself you hadnt even met her yet you hadnt gone on a single date you wanted her to be committed to you and just you before ever meeting there was no betrayal she was single she behaved,AuthorC
like a single person you made assumptions about her life and her choices in the weeks before you even met if this was something that was really important to you before entering a relationship then you need to ask dont ask dont tell is perfectly acceptable during the nonexclusive talking phase of getting to know someone if her past behaviour on apps or with casual sex were important to you it was on you to ask directly about these things the only thing that actually happened here is she had a different attitudes towards hooking up and casual sex than you assumed she had and its okay if that is a dealbreaker for you but its not a thing she did to you would have killed you to buy an enclosed frame or box seriously this sounds made up if its not grow up youre in rez there are usually pretty strictbizarre rules about what you can keep dont want to deal with rez rules and rez roommates then dont be in rez an,AuthorC
escalating war of snitching with a vaguely homophobic tinge to it sounds like a miserable way to spend the next few months thats about as likely to get you expelled as him but hey you do you illegal for the landlord to ask not to offer not for the realtor to recommend they offer it is happening more and more the realtor may be giving good advice in this case on how to secure it in other words you dont think its real sex or a real threat if there isnt a penis involved this is not a good look if you want to date queer women who has any selfrespect hah this is always a shittest i inadvertently use when im dating men do they realize that sex involving two women is still real sex or are they only threatened by other penishavers if they get nervous about men in my life but never about the women then they are invalidating both my ability to maintain boundaries with my friends but also my,AuthorC
bisexuality hard pass it sounds like your ex was uncomfortable with the upcoming period of longdistance its very very rarely just one silly thing its better if you can accept that imo the only way to fix this situation is to go scorched earth and do everything possible to take all custody from this toxic woman shes doing drugs and shes a neglectful abusive parent this should be a given totally agree but also totally out of ops control op can recommend the scored earth policy you describe here but then brother has to run with it and probably wont at least not yet op cannot enforce it or lead this charge it wont work if they do all op can really do right now is start to create consequences for mother and brother for not having strict boundaries with ashley the consequence that is within their power is you see us and your other grandkids far less because youre not creating safe situations for us as family when you include ashley nah let,AuthorC
him laugh youre helping your manager out by making your own boundaries clear first its important for you to tell the manager you asked him clearly politely to stop its important for the manager to know he laughed in your face makes it easier for them to do their job and to know they have too this man cheated on you and then tried to break up with you thats not just nre you created that narrative to protect yourself and he latched on cause it fit his needs in the moment you need to be seriously asking yourself if this man actually wants to be in an polyopen relationship if he is emotionally or cognitively equipped for it and willing to do the work to make it function and if you can even trust him to be able to tell you the truth on those first two points can this man even know what he wants and what work he is willing to do could he communicate that to you if he did,AuthorC
know you can never know the truth of another persons mind but every bit of evidence you have here says no no you cannot trust this man to be an emotionally responsible partner as a general rule you should really not try to reason someone out of breaking up with you you should have broken up and you should have forced yourself to find healthier ways to resolve your own confusion and grief the ones you picked were bandaids it could be the longterm agreement others comes to op cannot completely control that but the period right now is transitional with no legal agreements in place people are feeling their way through the separation so is a period where those agreements are going to be thought about and slowly come together which is why the best thing op can do within their power is decline to be in ashleys presence so that brother and mother have that information and that reality when making future plans and agreements this and then when he says its,AuthorC
just a joke you say i dont understand whats funny about accusing me to cheat can you explain the joke part of it to me followed finally by well whatever you intend i find it hurtfulinsulting please stop hurtinginsulting me you cant control other people you can only stop responding to the instigation every time you respond you make it a fight between two badly behaved people instead of one person being a bully ask him directly to stop once clearly in front of other people in the workplace tell him its unkind and unwelcome and you want him to stop doing that this is making you uncomfortable and its not okay to expose customers too when he doesnt speak to your manager about the behaviour shes not just the exwife shes not even that yet shes the coparent the mother of the grandchildren if you dont want to go to events where she is present dont that is the right response and it puts the ball back in your mother and brothers court,AuthorC
to properly manage their energy and time and invites during this transitional period and it is a transitional period with the divorce not yet being processed and no custody or separation agreement in place it makes sense for your brother not to antagonize her further the custody agreement is where they can spell out that when they are in his custody they will be spending time with his family members and she cannot enforce a blacklist in the meantime block her on socials there is no reason to expose yourself in any way to that this im baffled why he thinks the father would have signed over the land in a way that didnt prioritize and protect his daughter the only error here was not talking about what would happen to the home in the case of a divorce when deciding to build there someone should have brought that up but that group of someones includes op op should have asked both his fil and wife and his own lawyer op accepted a financialhousing,AuthorC
situation he didnt think through and now regrets it sucks its perhaps unkind but its not a conspiracy and its not the only reason this marriage is in serious trouble while i understand being upset with your wife this is also quite obviously what would take place you were 35 not 15 no one took you for a ride you built a structure on land that doesnt belong to you but to her father inheritance is usually exempt from shared property calculations this is rather basic shit im sorry it didnt occur to you but this isnt particularly underhanded did you think hed make some sortof cash gift to you after the marriage ended to buy you out of the land you didnt own would you have done that for your daughters ex given him a big old gift right after the marriage ended probably not if youre going to remain married its clear you have some big conversations and changes you need to make about your budget and legal situation but if you,AuthorC
want to get divorced this is clearly not the only reason behind that and you need to speak to a lawyer about the value you put into the house that you may have some entitlement too but thats a legal question not a relationship one its this to liberals this doesnt sound like humour just like condescending lying to conservatives its both humorous and the truth liberals tend to like jokes with irony and misdirection and ambiguity all things that take cognitive effort to decode thats fun that funny for them conservatives prefer jokes based on exaggeration and the grotesque tucker says exactly what he means up right away and then he intensifies it this requires no context or cognitive effort to understand but its experienced as funny as humour even while the exaggeration are often also accepted as literal truth i think jordan miss this sometimes with alex too the people who are listening to him would argue both that hes obviously joking and that hes telling the truth that makes a sort,AuthorC
of fundamental sense to them because that is what comedy is to them irony and misdirection are mean and take work and the comedian seems to be admitting its not really true so dont always resolve tidily or feel like attacks exaggeration is validating easy to listen to you therefor funny and also true this is not what an enjoyable friendship looks like for me it doesnt feel kind or funny youre totally allowed to have boundaries in your friendships this is lazy humour if they really need friendships where they are free to behave this way then they have those with someone else if they value your friendship on terms that make you both happy theyll cut it out im younger than you and queer and none of my male friends would behave this way on the regular a few of my gay guy friends may have when we younger but a general hey thats not my vibe addressed it just fine with no real hurt feelings you need to start saying no,AuthorC
without giving reasons or excuses anything you say about why you cant will just be the beginning of a debate or manipulation instead tell her the truth you wont youre not going too whether you can or not is not a necessary conversation because youre done lending money you may try to say consider the past money a gift but i will not lend money any more that might soften it and make you feel better since that is reality the reality anyways but accept that if she chooses to respond badly than she just will respond badly nothing you can do about that your job right now is to make yourself feel secure and comfortable saying no and sticking to it you cant really control how she chooses to react youre being ridiculous you shouldnt go to the wedding because youre fucking ridiculous and the happy couple really shouldnt have to deal with your bullshit you need to get over yourself if you really cant manage that on your own seek therapy its,AuthorC
been over a decade you were children this should be vaguely awkward and kind of funny it should not be anything more than that pretending that you were destined or that you had any rights to her or that you have any ability to not let this happen is all completely absurd im dead serious if you are actually this distressed about the situation please talk to a therapist this is not a healthy or rational response youve agreed the cats are hers the cats are hers the care of the cat is no longer your responsibility and also not something youre entitled to if she believes a contact with you of any kind will help the cat adjust she can i ask for your help with that however its probably far better for the cat to push through this adjustment period then to have intermittent and unreliable contact with you you just need to grieve this relationship that includes grieving the relationship with the cats if you believe your girlfriend is cognitively incapable,AuthorC
of empathy and has no regard for right or wrong dont date her drugs may be contributing but they are not the sole cause your bf is abusive its not your job to protect him from the neighbours knowing hes an abuser its his job to not be abusive go to the wedding alone and then make a plan to keep yourself safe and away from this man ask your family for help hes gonna hit you soon or worse he is abusing you and hes justifying his escalating abuse the only thing that stopped him was the embarrassment of the neighbours finding out he didnt stop because he didnt want to hurt you he stopped because he didnt want to get caught youre in very real danger gather up your important documents and have a friend keep them or mail them to your parents you were right to run keep running dont take your coworkers so seriously they probably arent seeing much they are more likely bored and using you two for entertainment,AuthorC
which is another thing you need to put a stop too by not giving it any more fuel stop spinning out on this like you said in the end you just have to step back there is nothing else you can do that is appropriate given the place your own head is at you need to start just saying no and keeping your distance one of two things is happening here 1 she is truly obliviously and genuinely trying to build a friendship with you and is open to opportunities outside of the workplace to do that so you need to end it and say no to those opportunities clearly because youre not happy or comfortable with her version of friendship and thats okay as with anything you can admit that a friendship connection isnt working for you and step back from it 2 shes looking to cheat with you so you need to end it because youre entering into a situation that can only possibly harm you with someone who is untrustworthy youre,AuthorC
reading an awful lot in to passing comments made in the workplace youre quite clearly overinvested yourself in the fantasy of her wanting you but the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle shes unhappy and not fully aware of what she is doing or thinking through what she is saying odds are good you are taking this far more seriously than she ever has the end result is the same tho stay away just be the bigger person and say im sorry to have hurt you our relationship was important to me but ive accepted it is over given how you feel about my choices to move on and date again i think its best we not continue to try to be friends good luck then block her she has no business berating you and you know it maybe she isnt trying to manipulate you but it doesnt really matter this isnt going to work as a friendship if that how she feels or how she behaves if she is going to be,AuthorC
this upset by the reality then youre not friends and you can end contact if you do not want to be in a relationship with someone who uses drugs frequently and to excess then hes not your person what is capable of is lying to you he is capable of lying in repeated obvious and predictable ways he is displaying the behaviour of being an addict and being in denial about that the odds of this getting better are slim the odds of it getting better before it gets much worse are basically nil if you go back in two weeks you will be in this exact same position again quite soon with an addict who broke their word again when it came to substance abuse this is entirely up to her if she doesnt wish to be in a relationship right now that choice is hers and needs to be respected depressed or mentally ill people are still entitled to end relationships breaking up isnt a choice you make together its a choice,AuthorC
one person makes and then its made it doesnt require your belief or your agreement if she wants this to be over then its over for any reason even reasons you dont like or agree with its nice that you believe you can be a source of support but in any relationship if one person chooses to end it its over youre her bf right now not her therapist or social worker or any other adult participating in her care or treatment you dont work together on serious mental health challenges you offer the support you can as a teenage bf and she can accept or reject any of those offers tell her you dont want to have any contact or conversation with someone she thinks might kill her if she wants to make up crazy stories act accordingly dont apologize tell her to stop putting you in danger too no i dont want to talk to your brother you told me he might tell your dad to kill you dont send photos of,AuthorC
me to potential murderers are you trying to get me killed as well you cannot fight that kind of crazy narrative so lean into it next she calls him tell her youre gonna talk a way and dont tell the people who want you dead that i live here please dont diagnose dont recommend a treatment plan you havent got those skills or information there is a level of whiteness that is within normal and the bacteria that causes bad breath isnt removed by scrapping the colour change is more likely caused by whatever is causing the smell instead of the cause itself of the smell or the smell might just have you noticing something that was always within normal for him he really shouldnt just start scrapping his tongue raw it may do nothing or he might make things even worse for his health instead tell him the fact that you do know his breath is bad and its getting worse ask him to please to speak to a doctor best option likely,AuthorC
a dentist about how to address it you cannot stop him from investing his portion tell him plainly this is not what you want for your future if he rather not buy right now that is a totally valid discussion but it needs to be a discussion with you his actual partner if he will not do that and it seems he has already decided not too you have learned that you need to financially plan for yourself and yourself alone he is not your partner when it comes to money he is not working with you you need to decide if the relationship can move forward or even survive with that limitation its okay to be mad but dont delude yourself into thinking you can fix it if you had a screenshot of that conversation that would be far more relevant to share with her than his more recent attempt at contact the choice is yours personally i dont police other people being shitty in their relationships i only stick my own neck,AuthorC
out if they are being dangerous and i have clear evidence of them being dangerous to date what you have here is bullshit not dangerous too many of the people who date casual shady assholes and liars just turn on the people who try to warn them no reason in my mind to open myself up to harassment or drama just because your bf is an asshole just block him the core problem here is that you dont want to speak to him hes not your friend you want him out of your life so get him out and dont insert yourself into the drama and court more contact and conversation with him or with his gf that is always a risk a risk of not being believed or even of being harassed in response and that is the opposite of what you actually want im all for taking that risk and telling a partner when there is some physical danger or harassment like cheating or blackmail or threats but here there is nothing,AuthorC
but bullshit lowkey opentointerpretation bullshit its just not yours to carry its not on you to do the work or take the risk to inform her of this sort of shit just be done with him your bf thinks youre trash and he feels entitled to treat you that way you were not stupid you just assumed that your bf didnt still think you were trash he does he always has he has always believed this about you and he will always believe he can treat you as if you were trash whenever it works for him the problem here is not about seeing your friend the problem here is your bf and its not getting better its not going to get better he feels entitled to weaponize this against you whenever he wants to lash out at you he will use this he will always shame you over this he believes he deserves to treat you this way as long as he continues to behave this way this is not a safe relationship,AuthorC
for you nice to hear a happy story with a partner who listened and stepped up thank you for sharing you need to change the password on your amazon account or disconnect your card or use a prepaid card you also need to seriously reconsider this relationship and the agreement youve come to with your wannabe trophy wife you cannot afford a trophy wife getting a joint account with this woman would be insane not caring if she contribute financially to the cost of your life together isnt laudable if you have negative funds in your account its just kinda stupid in other words you left really important details out of the op but they dont really change my advice hes bad people okay still her choice who is in her life and who isnt and not yours still something you need to speak up about respectfully and decide not to date her if you cant deal with her choice still an overreaction to i dont know youre responding as if she said definitely,AuthorC
yes were having coffee tomorrow and if my current bf told me it made him sick to think about me having sex with my ex id tell him to get the fuck over himself and stop fixating unfairly thats immature and unkind you keep arguing with her about her own experiences its fine to disagree but this condescending towards her like this isnt going to help her deal with her own past its fine to let her know how youre feeling but dear god rein those feelings in and bring more respect to the conversation stop making her past all about yourself yeah but he also has to do the work to not make it personal that is literally the bare minimum he needs to be doing here out of basic human respect you can and should expect better from him than the behavior youre describing anxiety makes controlling yourself more difficult at times but it doesnt mean hes not still expected to meet the minimum of respect and kindness hes not meeting that,AuthorC
i have a rather severe anxiety disorder and id never dream it would be acceptable to treat my partner the way he is treating you while you drive youre overreacting i dont know needs to be a valid and safe response to that question its fine to tell her that you rather she didnt its fine to be uncomfortable its not okay to loose your everloving mind over this its good for her to remember that you can forgive someone and not be mad at them without inviting them back in your life its vital you remember that she is entitled to choose her own friends and should be trusted to maintain appropriate boundaries with all the people she chooses as friends if you cannot trust her to do that dont date her boundaries yelling watch out for anything short of immediate risk of death is not acceptable behaviour for a passenger likewise boundaries against accusations are valid and important here he can be saying things like this feels fast or im uncomfortable with,AuthorC
the speed he should not be saying youre speeding his feelings are what he needs to communicate not his anxious assumptions or accusations about your behaviour he needs to recognize and use his words to reflect the fact his judgments in this situation are flawed and unreliable he is not that authority compromises you need to accept that time in a car is not together time instead of framing it as a chauffeur id recommend you think of driving the two of you places as a chore like doing the dishes or vacuuming one that is difficult or impractical to share but necessary to keep life going on your chore is driving his chore is managing his own shit while you drive so at that moment youre not together you both have taken on separate necessary tasks to get to a place both my partner and i have anxiety around carsdriving these are very similar to the boundaries we have in place when one of us is the passenger no spoken warnings unless they,AuthorC

right away either he actually believes these horrible things about you in which case you cannot date him or hes using these accusations as a way to manipulate and shame you in fear forcing you to be constantly proving yourself and validating and comforting him and that is abusive in which case you cannot date him he has told you he will not trust you he will not treat you with respect its been just a few weeks and hes telling you straight up how he intends to treat you get rid of him immediately you deserve someone who can treat you with basic human respect and trust this will get worse if you stay itll get worse fast you just say nah lets just say goodnight talk tomorrow and go live your life it is annoying and inconsiderate youre right to be upset but its also human and suggests that youre on the phone together way too much calls shouldnt go on forever they need to have natural ends adults have lives and,AuthorC
this is a problem you may be able to solve yourself by having a life and saying goodnight stop waiting or expecting youve noticed the pattern talk about it tell her if she really needs to go youre gonna consider the call done for the night and thats just fine stop making assumptions about his motivation based on second hang gossip until he crosses the line with your bf there is not enough to report the common friend needs to stop carrying water and courting drama tell this common friend to either keep this shit to himself or bring it to hr its not your problem to solve its just gossip and hes just stressing you out if you have questions that arent being answered or topics that are not being covered in your training document what you are missing and express your concerns to your trainer in a coherent way this shouldnt be he doesnt tell me how im doing cause its his job to train you not make you feel good about,AuthorC
yourself it sound look more like i am not confident with x and y tasks and when i have asked for more timefocus on these i have not received any if he doesnt respond to these concerns go above his head with them you are horrible people a is a monster youre no better both of you are disgustingly dramaseeking and selfish and your fucking around with ss feelings i hope s has the sense to never speak to either of you ever again she was managing her own shit privately nothing you say s actually did was disrespectful to anyone but you going on flirting with her and texting her behind as back sure as shit is disrespectful of them both you and your gf tricked her for your own dramatic bullshit reasons you entrapped her for no reason except your own validation and entertainment and youre still texting her now for your own selfish reasons youre shit people be less shit no one is required to stay in a relationship with you,AuthorC
shes not required to talk to you about it or try to work with you once she wanted out for any reasons she was perfectly entitled to leave and most sane people wouldnt want to talk to you when you clearly felt 100 entitled to cheat as long as you were drunk enough and seem to feel no remorse or regret over any of your choices and are only really upset your ex was stubborn many consensual cues exist prior to any approach youve described some of those contextual and situational declines to consent yourself a few times now this is not as hard as youre pretending it is and you might want to ask yourself why you feel the need to keep digging this particular hole we make assumptions and typically that assumption is pleasantries are perfectly fine and make a judgment call after that yes and those assumptions would fall under situational and contextual cues of consent you keep on describing your personal ability to read those kinds of clues just fine,AuthorC
im not sure what youre confused about do you think i cant read the clues you can do you think consent has to be a verbal declaration or a written agreement for every human interaction you say you dont want to be argumentative but you seem to be taking a deliberately obtuse position when we do not actually disagree very much at all about how individuals should judge whether or not a person is consenting to conversationinteraction its never unfair to ask for something that is important to you youre not allowing or disallowing him youre not gonna tie him up and drag him in so tell him no youre not telling him to do anything he doesnt get to put that on you and make it your job or responsibility to tell him what to do youre not his mommy or his prison warden youre his partner and youre telling him this is important to you youre asking him to prioritize your desire to have him join you at the event you both,AuthorC
agreed to attend its on him to communicate to you if this is a compromise he is capable of making and if it isnt he needs to say so clearly and have to respect it its okay to be disappointed in him if he chooses not to attend its not your job to be permanently cheerful just because he has a mental health struggle you still get to have feels and its not okay to take on the role of making this choice for him that is not a fair position for him to put you in and a role you must always reject he is responsible for his needs and his choices i totally 100 get cultural norms of certain places i am much less likely to speak to a stranger say in a gym or a hospital waiting room than walmart or a park then you are actually placing a value on the other persons consent to speak with you what about a person in the candy aisle looking at your favorite,AuthorC
stuff or i was at a bar and someone was looking over the menu and i mentioned what i thought was good some cultures will find this more or less appropriate based on a lot of different factors but in the end if they ignore you or give you nothing but a quick nod you shut up right if so congratulations youve just shown you value consent and will stop engaging another person when you dont receive any signals of it do i now assume consent because shes working so now its ok because shes paid yes you do you know thats how that works that is contextually implied consent or situational consent and if she said sorry im on break you would 100 immediately understand she meant she was declining to continue the conversation right consent there are lots of assholes out there but i disagree that they dont know or are bad at it most of them do know and as a species were actually pretty good at it the vast vast,AuthorC
majority of people can successfully read the cues and most abide by them youre gonna remember the 10 who didnt and not the 10000 who did human beings as a social species wouldnt exist or be nearly as dominant if we couldnt largely read these cues successfully that is why neurodivergent is well divergent most neurotypical people perform this shit on the regular most who dont are acting entitled for some reason but are not confused i live my life aiming to have received implied or contextual cues of consent from literally every person i interact with for more than a split second because why would i want to force other people to speak to me or accept my approach if they dont want too what benefit do i receive from that the level of consent required for 2 minute chat about the weather isnt the same as the level required for say having anal sex but consent is still in the mix are you a prison guard because besides having a job with,AuthorC
prisoners or infants i cannot imagine saying i dont need consent from each and every human being i ever approach and speak to i want that consent if i dont receive it willingly im going to stop approachingspeaking immediately yeah just like they would do naturally in literally every situation involving an individual who wasnt a woman they were expressing interest in in literally every other context you can watch the vast vast majority of men judge the vibe just fine im really sorry youre in this place op but you will be okay in the end you really will youre in the peak stage of grief right now losing your home and your relationship at once and in a particularly shitty way grief is a helluva a drug no way through it except to go through it relationships carry this risk youll probably want to take the risk again someday with someone else but maybe you wont and thats okay too itll still get better either way eh happens to the best of,AuthorC
us just turn off reply notifications and give yourself a break this too will pass there are very reasonable situations in which you should be able to talk to anyone without them being pissed at you i think the thing many men fail to understand and often are choosing not to understand is that even in those totally reasonable situations to approach someone a woman may get spooked or seem put off for a moment that doesnt mean you did anything wrong or that shes frightened or angry it probably just means that being approached in public is a generally negative experience for her and she has her guard up its not a personal attack she doesnt owe it to you to fall all over herself with gratitude or friendliness its okay that she has a life experience that has taught her to be careful of men who approach her in public if she was a person you were close to youd probably want her to careful of strange men trying to get her,AuthorC
attention in public so dont be such a damn snowflake cause a stranger you spoke to looked at you in a way that made you feel like anything less than prince charming if you know you did a reasonable thing then its not about you let it be not about you like youd have no problem doing if you handed a man back something he dropped and was a bit curt or something seesh absolutely the person replying to you knows 100 knows that the examples they are giving are not what you are talking about whatsoever they are just being a little shit they know you know it sane people reading what you both wrote know it do not engage its a transparent attempt at baiting you into a totally different totally stupid debate youre never gonna reach people who feel this entitled to a strangers time they act like they dont understand but they do people make choices all the time to leave others alone when there are zero signals of wanting,AuthorC
to engage watch men sitting side by side at a sports bar watch a game or male coworkers sitting down in a break room they sus out in seconds who wants to speak and who doesnt they arent as stupid as they want us to believe they all know its okay to return something someone dropped or ask the time these ones just dont want to do the tiny bit of work they do happily every single day with the human beings they see as equals men when they feel entitled to womens attention and niceness no amount of logic can reach them s invited you youre invited dont insert yourself into the situation between the two of them by speaking with u or doublechecking about u s invited you youre invited dont go seeking drama if youre not able to attend because of the costtimingwhatever tell s youre sorry not to be able to join him on his big day and send them both a nice congratulatory card change the framing a bit,AuthorC
and let him know that you are unhappy and that you have realized a breakup will happen eventually if he doesnt change his behaviour and choices maybe not tomorrow maybe not next week but it is going to happen you cannot continue on as things are do not use the threat of a breakup as a manipulation tactic or a threat just let it be a reality about how you are feeling and what your concerns are youre not a bad person for having these thoughts but you need to manage them hes 16 teenagers are by their very nature selfish fuck ups its normal and can even be a totally healthy developmental stage that doesnt make what he did okay but it does mean he should be carrying these labels from your narcissistic ex 16yearolds are not diagnosed with npd or sociopathy by responsible doctors for that very reason get yourself some professional help whatever your son situation even if you dont like the adult he becomes youll want to know you were,AuthorC
the best parent possible and right now that means getting yourself some support for your own trauma and your patterns no obviously not its already running into trouble look you and he are entitled to take any risks you both choose to take personally and professionally but youre asking if this is a good idea and you already have some evidence less than a month in that it is probably not a great idea more context is definitely important in the end you need to be able to trust and respect your partners choice of friends that doesnt mean agreeing or also being friends with them yourself but it means respecting the choice is belongs solely to your partner its not your call they get to pick who is their life your call is whether or not youre going to be one of those people yourself if your bf is making choices for himself that you cannot tolerate or respect then dont date him if youre asking this question probably not the problem here,AuthorC
isnt just the sex its the communication he hasnt told you what he values about intimacy or about you he doesnt appear to have considered speaking to a doctor although any reasonable human being could tell youre not happy he hasnt considered change or making any conscious communicated effort with you hes locked you out on this subject even though he is aware its hurting you thats just not just the sex its not just that aspect that is a carelessness and lack of compassion not just in the sexual intimacy but in the communication about it why do you care that this friend keeps telling you hes not sexually interested in the way you dress why have you not told him youre not trying to please him and other heterosexual men males when you dress each morning for your job and that his opinion is as unwelcome as it is unkind you address this by telling him if he cannot say anything kind he shouldnt say anything at all the lesson most of,AuthorC
us first get taught in kindergarten you further address this by no longer letting him stick his wiener in someone he doesnt treat with respect and compassion hes nearly 40 years old if he needs more than one single clear reminder not to insult the woman hes orgasming with get the fuck rid of him because you thought youre showing her the paper plan was a good one if henry cavill did that to me and my workplace id still be uncomfortable with it that is shockingly poor judgment and raises skepticism about everything else youve reported here but also because it sounds like youre a prospective student which means you have fundamentally misunderstood the situation shes a sales professional a financial person at a university who meets with prospective students is performing a sales role youre considering buying a product from her workplace of course shes nice to you just like a woman who sells shoes or coffee would be nice to you you should not do this this is a bad idea,AuthorC
but since we all know youre going to anyways do not lie no one enjoys that and it risks appearing creepy and invasive dont show her the paper simply leave her a sealed note addressed to her like a fricking normal person dropping off a damn note it is better if you are not physically present when she is reading the note that is less pestering and coercive standing in front of her with that message is 100 not okay and its concerning you felt it was also dont do this nothing about this question suggests you have excellent judgment and have correctly understood the situation you reframe it as a break up because that is what hes offering its not secure its not practical its not kind your soon to be ex is treating you like a character a secondary character in his story he is expressing to you that youre not filling the role hes assigned as happy and vibrant supporting female cast member one he is declining to consider you as,AuthorC
a full human being or even one who might have her own adventures when hes off on his the fact this is unequal is the point of it for him hes not framing this as an agreement between equals but as a story where he is the main character and whatever moves his narrative forward is the right thing if you agree you will be in a slow motion break up for months until you finally admit the intolerable thing is intolerable even if you made it through he would come back to even more convinced of youre not people he is the main character and you are the girlfriend in a few episode arch he will continue to treat you as disposable like any bad writers room would let it be a break up consider how much contact if any you want with him when he is your ex at seventeen i would apologize and agree to honour her mothers boundaries for another year or two moms get to be wrong teenagers know,AuthorC
this right now the biggest danger to your relationship with your niece is actually your sister cutting you off your niece will understand just fine if the next time it comes up you say look your mother has asked me not to speak so openly with you and for the next few years im going to honour that boundary unless youre in danger or afraid are you nope then do you have any older girlfriends you can ask nothing about this conversation suggests your niece was in danger or at risk instead of teaching your niece about sex teach her about being practical and making short term compromises to keep the peace youre misunderstanding im not saying you should always respond when anyone knocks im saying you should provide as much positive reinforcement as possible when trying to build the desirable behaviour of knocking in someone who is resisting the boundary most people wont change if from their experience of it honouring the boundary catches them just as much shit as not honouring it,AuthorC
and it doesnt matter if that experience is accurate or not sister isnt likely to think i shouldnt have opened the door because she already doesnt think that shes way more likely to think i knocked twice and it was still a fight so why bothering knocking its a big spectrum mostly purple pill people seem to imagine they are moderates or neutral when it comes to the red pill blue pill debate a lot of the same jargon pseudoscience and genderessentialism youll find on red pill forums but with less overt hatred of women mostly ive found it to be good old fashion sexism with a lot of boya will be boys because of evolution and all women are like that because attentionseeking there is definitely a lot of normal well everyone has challenges and modern life sucks in a lot of ways but its all done in a way that basically accepts the red pill fundamental framing redpillers would say purple pilled men know the truth but lack the courage to act,AuthorC
on it the rest of us normies would probably say purple pillers are being very weird to associate themselves at all with the redblue pill narratives and jargon to embrace the shit science of the red pill or to argue that people like tate have a few good points in other words he knows how to control himself with others where there would be consequences for his shitty behaviour but feels entitled to treat you poorly and doesnt think there should be consequences when he does so like a person who has anger issues with their partner but manages to hold down a job without every verbally abusing their boss or coworkers that person absolutely can help it they just want to abuse their partner at least for a little while i think giving her frequent positive reinforcement when she does knock is going to help you establish the boundary and offer her more clarity and fewer excuses when she violates it i understand it is what it is right now but man this,AuthorC
really sucks for her too definitely focus on ending this living situation it just doesnt lend itself to a good dynamic between you two and while she was in the wrong in this case you have to recognize that good behaviour can be harder for everyone to maintain in bad situations and this is a bad situation for everyone everything about this set up suggests there is a hierarchy where you and your husband are more important and get more privileges than she does it really sucks that shes acting out but hell a lot of people would have to express their unhappiness and hurt over this in some way i dont disagree with you its just that by not responding in that moment op undermined her own boundary and missed an opportunity to reinforce the correct behaviour with a civil response to her sister she wasnt napping or in the middle of something that shouldnt be interrupted according to her she just didnt wanna and she would have been wise to make the,AuthorC
effort to reward the behavior she wanted to see even though she didnt wanna talk at that moment when it comes to managing family members being effective and giving positive reinforcement for the behaviour you want to see is almost always better in the longterm than being right sure sister was still in the wrong but op undermined her own boundary by not taking the opportunity to reinforce the correct behaviour the knocking with a civil response when it comes to managing family members being smart and effective is almost always better than being technically in the right your boundaries are reasonable but youre kinda glossing over the fact you and your husband walk through her room every time you need to get to yours and that the ac is in your room that is so inequitable might not be a great situation for anyone but your sister got the shit end of the stick in this living arrangement im not surprised she feels put on by being asked to abide by your boundaries,AuthorC
around a door when it doesnt sound like she has a door and is basically living in the hallway you and your husband use i have a bit more sympathy for someone who is acting like a child when the living situation provides them with the level of privacy wed give a toddler also if you ask people to knock you need to not ignore them when they do so you need to provide some positive reinforcement and make it a common practice to reply positively when someone engages in the behaviour you want them too your exboyfriend is not required to speak with you its not an excuse for anything he doesnt want to talk to you he shouldnt want to talk to you he is probably hoping to never see you again youre terrible it was only two weeks and you were totally unhinged and terrible to him most people dont want to speak to people who throw things at them and are verbally abusive you dont get second chances youre not,AuthorC
entitled to them you dont even deserve a chance to apologize you just have to be less shitty in the future and accept the consequences for the shitty you were this time we have much stronger evidence of andrew tates misogyny besides his preferences when it comes to human trafficking victim selection its one thing to want downtime its another completely to attempt to banish your partner from a shared home tell him no there are problems to resolve but this isnt a solution this is a toxic and controlling approach youll make plans with friends for a dinner or a movie so he can have some interrupted time with other but you will be sleeping in your own home the home you share if he needs to sleep separately he can go see his family not kick you out young men are being irreparably harmed by patriarchal power structures and compulsory service and thats a good thing because they get rewarded with access to women who will tolerate their ptsd and alcoholism if,AuthorC
they dont die young did i understand that correctly this is the promen position a return to let the powerful old men crush your spirit and body to build their own wealth but hey maybe youll get laid i would tell my father ive been seeing someone for x length of time and that it is a serious and important relationship for me id tell him that this relationship is my choice and that will need to be respected but that i love him and value his opinions id ask him his thoughts and if he has any questions id be clear im not really asking for his permission or blessing but i am asking him to be an important part of my actual life not just the life hed rather imagine that i have if he is disappointed or angry those responses arent going to go away the longer you wait they are going to fester and become more engrained and extreme the sooner you act like a young adult making a valid,AuthorC
young adult choice the sooner he will be able to accept that reality i didnt say difficult i said untenable that means intolerable unbearable not able to be maintained you dont just need to empathize with that empathy is not a sufficient addressing of the real issue here you need to respect that reality and realize you are approaching what may be a dealbreaker if you cannot change on a timeline he finds tolerable youre being extremely naive to believe your father will not experience your current behaviour as dishonesty the longer you avoid this and you are absolutely avoiding this not managing it the more anxiety and distrust you are generating all around most people in your fathers position will be less inclined to trust and respect your judgment if they feel they have been misled iced out or otherwise played for the fool i understand why you made the call you did at 6 am but the situation is becoming untenable for your bf and that is reasonable you need to speak,AuthorC
with your father this isnt going to get easier the longer you leave it its only going to further damage your relationships with everyone involved youre not respecting anyones traditions by lying the balance you have right now is not the right balance you need legal advice at this point this isnt a relationship question anymore its a question of when you can legally require him to vacate and what steps you need to take to enforce the agreement that you are keeping the house and he is leaving it thats not just a lack of emotional support that is a lack of basic consideration for another human being thats not just not showing up as a partner hes not even showing up as a friend my workfriends show me more compassion than your partner shows you this is not likely to be solved by suggestions and boundaries hes doing what works for him this isnt an accident this is the relationship he wants to be in and how he wants it to work,AuthorC
which means the solution is leaving him not being in the relationship he wants with him regardless of what you choose get some therapy and support to work on your trauma and peoplepleasing ways so you dont get trapped in one of these dynamics in the future this will not be as simple as coming up with one or two boundaries itll be a longterm challenge and youll need some ongoing advice and support i am partially to be credited for the fact that he will soon be in line for a promotion to a leadership role i want nothing but good things for him then youre not really working as equals are you you need to nip this in the bud you shouldnt be entertaining his inappropriate behavior or your own irrational fantasies you do nothing you take a step back from a man who is not romantically or emotionally stable is currently in a relationship is terribly oversharing in the workplace who is a pretty direct danger to your promotion and paycheque,AuthorC
and who you have an inappropriate level of authority and influence over in the workplace im sorry but really give your head a shake and quit this fantasy life and justificationseeking this is a tremendous risk youre workshopping inside your brain for someone who is objectively a huge risk to you personally and professionally even though he still currently has a girlfriend you need to take a huge step back youve crossed lines inside your own head that shouldnt be crossed certainly not at this point get a hobby or a tinder profile and leave this dramafest alone you managed your anger here very poorly dont matter if it was valid anger you handled it poorly p may also be a racist shithead your bf also should have communicated with you about the planned visit you probably should be broken up but despite your neutral language your own poor choices still come through clearly texting p directly was shitstirring and dramaseeking behaviour the problem was with your bfs communication with you not with her,AuthorC
texting her wasnt going to resolve it texting her as a guest of your bf behind his back was obviously counterproductive and just about as disrespectful of him as him not telling you she was coming if you dont want a relationship with her for the love of god dont text her passiveaggressive boundaries you know are only going to cause more drama and throwing things in anger is never acceptable behaviour ever full stop that doesnt mean your reasons for the breakup werent valid but it does mean you need to do better than this with someone better youre right it would be absolutely horrible to go through this a random nonsense comment from your seven year child who either misunderstood or is looking to get a rise out of you is not the basis for a paternity test you said youd walk so walk youre making this way more complicated than you need too stop enjoying the drama and sleuthing its just letting yourself be dragged down you know the outcome so,AuthorC
go face the outcome with as much dignity and decency as you can boundaries require personal reflection and context we cannot give you a list of what you personally need to feel secure and happy in this relationship besides the big one obvious ones from kindergarten like dont punch people you just have to do that work if there are particular areas you need specific advice ask for that you dont make him see you tell him he is expected to behave with respect and that his negativity towards a pet is deeply concerning behaviour you will not be tolerating a persons jealousy of a pet is a major red flag you should be seriously questioning if this man helped you with boundaries with your friends or family or if he simply isolated you from people who actually care for you so he could control you more efficiently in regards to the cat as others have said a rotation of toys would probably be a good thing to try youll spend a bit less,AuthorC
and you may learn a bit more about what she really likes the most if you dont keep the newness factor dialled up to 100 all the time its easy for things to start feeling like attacks when they dont need to be but be wary of someone who decides to treat everything like an attack because they want that excuse to ignore you its not unreasonable to ask a grown man to mind his ps and qs you know the answer please consider this one more internet random telling you what you already know perfectly well this man is not reliable and will cheat on you if he hasnt already id like you to say hello please and thank you to service staff when were out together its making me uncomfortable and embarrassed to be near you when you treat them so impolitely this isnt a conversation about how you two were raised this is a conversation about what you need in a relationship to feel happy and secure and respected he should,AuthorC
be sorry to embarrass you and make you and the staff uncomfortable the correct response to that childishness bullshit whinging is thank you im glad you care about my feelings here is the easy fix and the expectation moving forward nope thats the assumption youre making about his motivation he didnt say he didnt bring it up because it wasnt important or he didnt even think of it he claimed he lied to her to protect her he wants a maid and a chef and porn star who can never choose to service anyone but him but not one he has to pay he wants all that service in exchange for his lovely company i guess because of course he wouldnt date a lazy women who doesnt work the pattern here is his resentment yes not dating her would have been a valid choice for him continuing to attack her for years about this whenever he gets pissed off aboth something else is absolutely not a valid choice something being kinda difficult doesnt justify,AuthorC
whatever other behaviour someone engages in this guy is not behaving in a way op is required to find acceptable she does not need to go on choosing him and if she is going too she can absolutely be clear about what treatment she is willing to accept moving forward you mean another situation where he found an excuse to wield those insecurities like weapons and we know he will continue to do so each time hes pissed with her about something else for years thats a hard pass from me ops bf shouldnt continue to date her if he couldnt moderate his emotions better than this and op shouldnt date him if he doesnt commit to and begin to moderate his emotions better than this sex five years ago isnt the least bit important to me having it withheld from me when the past partner is currently in both of our lives because my partner thought i have the emotional skills of a jealous 12 year old would be very important this woman,AuthorC
is currently in both of their lives and the connection has been growing it shouldnt have been omitted that is not an exhaustive reckoning that is relevant today and i dont know where youre getting he didnt disparage her cause he clearly did more than just once including the part where he decided for her that basic truths would just be too distressing for her to handle if someone is still currently an important and valuable friend in your life you should be willing to provide your partner with the basic context for that including a past sexual relationship thats not an entire dossier thats just not purposefully leaving your partner in the dark about current realities and relationships lies of omission are lies and while op may be unhappy now she didnt tell him years ago please never tell me if youve had sex with your friends i dont want to know without that explicit rule in place he absolutely should have done so that is how a reasonable respectful person behaves her,AuthorC
feelings of discomfort now dont validate his past treatment of her he treated her like a child who couldnt handle it and worse he made that treatment public he cast her as an immature fool who cannot handle basic reality in front of his close friends and created the risk of even greater confusion and embarrassment for her this should have been discussed and addressed a long time ago with respect and transparency he didnt do that it should have been a nonissue a thing you talk about and move past easily he made it an issue when it didnt have to be by treating op this way he done fucked up and now its worse than it needed to be youre not if youre willing to look past this behavior you need to be clear with him it is not acceptable for him to try to protect you or manage you by lying to you youre not a child who needs to be protected from pg13 content youre an adult worthy of respect,AuthorC
and honesty and youre his partner not his child if something upsets you that is valid and it is something you and he may need to address if he continues to lie to you because he thinks youre too sensitive this relationship will not and should not survive do not date someone who trying to manage you by lying to you or withholding information you both know damn well youd prefer to have this scenario comes up sporadically when hes mad at me so hes still punishing you for something you didnt do wrong two years ago and now hes inventing new things to punish you for from your miami trip that you also didnt do yuck the way you addressed only one very specific part of what i said to you leaves me suspecting you have an ongoing issue of not addressing your partners bids for connection and quality time with any real empathy you know you were right to stand up for your needs here and shes allowed to be disappointed or,AuthorC
annoyed but how you describe communicating here leaves a lot of room for improvement and empathy from you both your gf experienced this as a personal rejection and nothing you did to express yourself softened that blow it was right to stick up for your needs thats not unreasonable but if the tone of this question is the tone you used to express those needs to your gf im not surprised communication went downhill this tone is very harsh and unkind do you regularly end up in these sorts of conflicts did you consider another way to spend some focused time together in the shortterm not just kicking it back one or two weeks your gf made a bid for connection and attention and while your desires for down time it totally reasonable your headed down a bad path here with how you express yourself so much this i feel like this is one of those spots where you can tell this show is being made through a lens of a lot of hetero,AuthorC
producers for a largely straight audience from that perspective vanessa is the hot commodity the kind of exciting extroverted fem pansexual that many straight men idolize but in queer circles the vanessas are relatively common and people like natasha and xander are the oneinamillion catch of a lifetime choosing a tactic is showing intent aussie has shown some very very clear tactics she might not be fully conscious or willfully doing harm it might not be malicious but it absolutely tactical these are tactics of emotional abuse and control that aussie has used to get her way i get not wanting to label the person but we can label the actions just fine the actions are abuse this is some petty ass shit stop stewing she doesnt have to be your bestie its okay if she doesnt like you much that is for your ex to address if it ever needs addressing but there is nothing here that suggests it does as long as your childrens needs are met when they are with their,AuthorC
father let it go you know you know he used access to a former clients personal information at his workplace to drop by her private home you know thats an offence that should probably get a person fired hes not a poor little confused child he is a damn adult and he knows he knows that you know he knows thats not nice you know its not nice hes not a nice guy hes lying to you youll never know the full truth but the truth you do know means at least this his judgement is terrible he cannot be trusted as a safe partner this isnt a person you can built a life with the best case scenario here is that he is so stupid thats he cannot be relied on to stay employed thats the best case there are definitely more than 102 signs this mildred is imperfect and has some work to do but i take her tendency to interrupt and confront over passive aggression and weaponizing triggers any day we,AuthorC
saw two totally different approaches to managing aussie and i think neither of them worked but mildreds not worked faster thats a win in my book this is abusive feederism fetishes frequently are this is one of those fetishes that many people do not engage with ethically this is abuse im amazingly frighteningly kinkpositive to a degree that would make most people squirm but id avoid someone who embraced active and frequent feederism in real life the chances of them engaging with it in respectful consensual and safe ways are just kinda slim feederism is rarely about bodypositivity almost always about exerting control limiting the larger persons ability to move and act independently its about phsyical dependence and societal rejection you want to move better and feel better in your own body that is probably in direct opposition to what he finds sexually exciting he most likely wants you to be restricted and limited by your size he has told you and shown you that he really will not tolerate any movement towards body,AuthorC
independence and that is abusive he may also have trauma but this is not trauma this is him seeking an abusive degree of control over you and calling it kink he is not behaving ethically you do not need to protect his feelings you need to tell him hes entirely out of line and if he cannot cope with that he needs to get his ass to a therapist to relearn some of the basics about respect and consent shes still enmeshed with her abuser two to three times a week is excessive she knows it he knows it you know it shes not emotionally available for a new relationship at this point do with that what you will you dont have to be friends with anyone you dont want to be friends with stop trying to read her mind or invent reasons for her actions youll never really know just be honest if it situation isnt working and if youd like to end it you dont need to assumptions about her motivations what,AuthorC
you know about her actions is plenty enough to inform a decision its a large gap it would be extremely naive to assume it wouldnt cause issues thats not about socially acceptable and it has nothing to do with your appearance it has to do with practical matters of life stages relative power to make choices and take important life steps and compatible short and longterm goals you dont need to take everyones opinion to heart but you do need to realize they are not being insane people who care for you are going to be concerned for you at a glance there are some valid concerns here you might feel you just fell into this relationship naturally but i assure you that people who are 40 dont accidentally date people 12 years younger than them women who are over 40 know this about men over 40 and not cause they are bitter its just cause they were 20somethings once too and they have eyes attached to brains which can notice patterns older people,AuthorC
who accept or seek out age gaps like this have made a choice and there are often not always but very often problematic motivations for that choice you say no you just say no that isnt healthy for me im sorry it makes you sad but i cannot compromise on this this is my health and i need to take it seriously i need you to respect that she has a wish you have a physical health need a need trumps a wish that is how healthy compromises are supposed to work between people who care for one another book one or two meals a week that are together and offer to cook for you both at those times but be clear she is choosing her feelings over your health and you cannot agree to that you cannot keep yourself physically sick to make her feel happier every day thats fucked up you need her to manage her feelings so you are free to manage your diet you need that in a partner right,AuthorC
now and that is valid if she cannot manage that for you then shes not being a very good partner right now and frankly she should speak to a counsellor about how to manage those feelings herself they are not rational fair or kind id be seriously concerned if i were you that your partner is trying to sabotage your health plans yeah its best not to listen too closely to someones reasons for not being interested most people dont really know what they want they are most often bullshit they are just saying to protect their own ego or avoid responsibilityaccountability please recognize you might have saved yourself a bit of suffering if youd had that tough conversation a few weeks earlier before the hookups became a bad habit thats understandable youve got some work to unpack that bullshit you and this particular guy may not be compatible its been a few months and most people arent but if that turns out to be the case its probably not because of his education,AuthorC
level you need to stop giving in to your familys bad habit of attributing everything about a person to the letters behind their name dont frame it that way thnk about behaviours and choices and your own actual feelings about your relationship hell to be entirely honest i now avoid dating phds unless they can take the shit outta themselves and the whole academic pyramid scheme i have some great friends who are tenured but know far more professors id never want to have to share a meal with dont try to make friends on dating apps the risk of exactly this sort of confusion is high after a few months of dating one or both people will decide it isnt really working that is totally normal most people you ever date will fizzle out in about that timeframe thats dating thats life he just wasnt that interested it was rather immature of him to try to make it your fault but its okay for him to not be interested if he was interested,AuthorC
he would have done the work to communicate and alter the way he saw the connection he didnt because he wasnt you didnt do anything terribly wrong you were honest he probably was largely honest as well but also a bit cowardly and immature about it and unwilling to just speak to his own wishesneeds without finding a way to try to turn it around you its unlikely he actively set out to use you just set out to do what felt good for him its three months in and youre already worried that youre currently bored by him quite honestly you sound a bit immature and hopefully youll grow and realize that being an academic or having an advanced degree doesnt make you a good conversationalist or even a particularly smart person those are utterly separate skill sets from what makes a successful academic some real numbskulls can plow through a phd defence and they do being an academic means being a highlyfocused and specialized learner on a very narrow subject its an,AuthorC
amazing and laudable skill that is necessary to advance human society but it often makes for shitty condescending conversationalists who think being really informed about one subject means they have any brains at all when it comes to others this right now is a question of compatibility and respect its three months in and you lack some important respect and you are questioning your compatibility those are concerns worth listening to about this specific individual even if your generalizations about academia and advanced degrees are off the mark if this is a core belief for you youd be wise to build your life around it move to a highly religious area throw your time and effort and energy into that religious community or church frankly it sounds like you have set yourself up for isolation and disappointment and will reject any advice that might move you out of that sort of space but the only reasonable advice to give you is to tell you that even if you choose to never have sex and,AuthorC
you are absolutely choosing that its not been forced on you in any way you do need community and purpose youd be wise to go find that community in a highly religious environment that respects your choices regarding interactions with men it doesnt sound like youre safe at home with your husband right now this would be a situation where id take the baby and ask if my parents would take us in give him some very clear instructions about when and how he is able to visit ie in a few days for a few hours only while sober decline to speak to him privately until you feel prepared to do so do not let him rush you or pressure you stay where you feel safe your priority right now is the physical safety of you and your newborn you are not physically safe with someone who is treating you that way be very careful get some physical distance be clear with your husband the standards of behaviour that are expected and dont,AuthorC
budge dont accept less than what that child deserves and that child deserve a mother who is safe and respected as well id dump you for that that is a massive violation your gf heard you out and listened to your opinion and she told you shed reinforce boundaries the next time they were crossed she told you directly not to get involved and then you did anyways that was a breach of he trust and it was also degrading and demeaning and embarrassing her friend friends probably by now not just him now all know that she has a controlling and suspicious boyfriend who doesnt trust her and goes behind her back to treat her like a badly behaving sixyearold id be so offended and ashamed if my partner did that i dont think id continue with them the first thing you do is admit you were 100 in the wrong here its fine to be concerned and ask questions of her but it was 100 wrong to contact him behind her back,AuthorC
and against her wishes you apologize for not respecting her trusting her and for doing precisely what she clearly told you not to do if you really dont trust her dont date her but never pull this shit again youd be wise to speak to a therapist or counsellor especially one with a family practice and consider what kind of role you want to have in the childrens lives that is going to depend a lot on their ages as well as their individual personalities and it also needs to include what kind of contact with your ex is possible and healthy for you i think maintaining some longterm committed cool uncle status would be admirable and probably bring some stability to the kids lives continuing to be dad in any real way would be more likely to be confusing or even dishonest the relationship needs to be downgraded but id hope youd be willing not to end it completely if the children value occasional but predictable and reliable contact with you say no,AuthorC
he cannot afford it you cannot afford it together the answer is no if you say yes you will be married by mortgage this is way more serious than walking down the aisle so if youre not ready to do that you absolutely should not be doing this this is a stupid risk you are not supporting him in this for the same reason you wouldnt support him if he wanted to go hang gliding on a frame made of silly putty keeping an open mind doesnt mean letting your brain fall right out he can either find a way to buybuilt equity with his 240k or he can wait until you both are prepared for this step tell her that you are concerned about remaining in a relationship where your gf calls you a liar and refuses to trust you or respect you when you tell her something important about how you feel its okay to ask for reassurance at times we all need that from our partners but the way she is,AuthorC
seeking reassurance from you is not respectful or kind she needs to find other ways to ask for whatever it is she needs and she has to respect your answers when you give them youre not being unreasonable do not stay in a relationship with someone who is constantly accusing you of lying to them we both knew that was the outcome no matter what i did but it is pretty funny isnt it x200b she says over the last few decades more and more women have found that partnering with men is not a good deal for them and costs them more in effort money or overall happiness than remaining single the data backs it up and it is a much more clear and longerterm trend than mgtow or the rise of the manosphere he says prove it she says i have judged this not to be worth that additional labour from me but good luck in your research here are a few pointers the data is out there and i am confident,AuthorC
in my understanding of it he says i just knew she was full of shit i dont believe you if id have believed you were sincere i would have cited my sources but i actively choose not to do that labor based on how you decided to respond to those who did an honest bit of googling is your friend if you are sincere about looking into the comparative happiness health or wealth of single and partnered people woman and men the apps dont love to give current data on the decreasing number of woman users because it undermines their marketing case to men but it can be found especially if you search for impacts of the overturn of roe vs wade on these apps if you are sincere about putting forth that effort i wish you luck but i have a job that pays me to do this sort of work and im disinclined to do it right now here for free youre repeating propaganda not data women have been increasingly leaving the,AuthorC
dating pool for decades especially women who are divorced widowed or have children whereas men in those situations are more likely to be highly motivated to find a new partner dating apps are imperfect places for information but even they are quietly reporting women quiet quitting dating in droves and the women to men ratio on the apps are getting worse and worse and the normal ratio was already pretty bad being partnered is still by in large a better deal for a straight man than a straight women generally speaking men gain support wealth health and happiness and generally speaking women loose those things are there men who are giving up on dating sure are in comparable numbers to women no that isnt what decades of data tells us the men who are quitting are just far louder about it and louder about what they feel is wrong about the world that they cannot access sex and service from women because partnership is so much less likely to enrich womens lives sufficiently for,AuthorC
them to pay the price men risk dating a bad individual women risk that plus the risk that dating even one of the good ones will still leave them more worn out and more poor than they were before you and your mother need to manage your anxieties and curiosities coming up with half baked theories online is not a good way to do that if you want to express support actual support and not just morbid curiosity then do that but your sister ended contact and its strange and a bit suspicious you just ignore any reasons for that that needs to be respected im glad youre getting support dont stay in this relationship if its not supporting your health and happiness you need a therapist not a boyfriend youve struggled to draw your own personal boundaries with this guy and his questions that was largely behaviour you should have been able to shut down yourself without needing anything but more passive support from your bf and while we all may experience some,AuthorC
anxiety when a partners friends doesnt seem to like us the extreme youve found yourself in is not healthy for anyone it doesnt seem like this relationship is working for you in some other key ways as well stop martyring yourself and get some treatment for your anxiety so you can handle things better with someone better keep working with your therapist dont connect with your ex at all youre really not being rational about this i understand its hurtful but your best path towards healing doesnt including confronting her or challenging her narrative thats literally the worst thing you can do both for your own sanity and for the risk of escalating bad behaviour i understand this is really upsetting but you need to realize this was the best possible outcome she overplayed her hand with people who knew you well enough to know she was lying nothing was going to stop her from doing this it was actually pretty predictable if youre totally honest with yourself and neither you or your friends,AuthorC
had the power to shut her up shitty people do shitty things and most of those things are totally legal but she didnt receive positive reinforcement for her behaviour thats the best thing that could have happened to discourage her from continuing that game make it boring dont let this game of lies provide any drama or validation or supply there is no other strategy for you give your friends some more grace while they may have made mistakes they were probably sincerely trying to protect you from information you couldnt handle in a healthy way and they werent wrong even now youre struggling to manage this information practically keep up with the therapy and if you need boundaries with your friends when it comes to your ex ask for those boundaries clearly im concerned what you think putting yourself out there entails that it will inevitably lead to accusations of criminal behaviour this is not about looking human beings notice other human beings bodies that is not what hes up too your bf,AuthorC
is taking steps to cheat on you thats not a guy thing thats a cheater thing hes trying to coerce you into accepting him having sexual contact or just straight up sex with others get rid of him shopping for sex workers has nothing to do with checking out attractive people at the beach or gym that like arguing that everyone snores in their sleep and you have to learn to put up with it and then punching you a few times while youre asleep and saying its totally the same thing and you should just put up with it its not the same thing i am sorry i misunderstood that being a conversation in front of him but seriously you still have to start with an apology drop it doesnt mean go have a deep heartfelt discussion with my dad which includes the private conversations taking place in our marriage where we both know you think im wrong you can disagree with your wife privately but you cannot talk about her behind her,AuthorC
back especially not with a parent and expect her to feel okay about it no matter how wrong she is that choice from you is going to damage your marriage the first thing you do is stop taking sides stop scolding her and stop telling her what she owes her wonderful father she currently does not wish to revisit the topic it would be sensible and respectful for everyone to accept that for the next 48 hours she asked you to stay out of it and you immediately turned around and told her father exactly what you had said to her that was absolutely an act of sidetaking and then you come back in and in front of her father insulted her that made you an unsafe person for your wife to come to with vulnerable or fraught feelings after the visit begin with an apology you did poorly then you can discuss how you were surprised by the amount of pain and anger she was carrying towards her father not because shes wrong,AuthorC
but because you were ignorant of it and unaware she had those feelings towards him and suggest she deserves and would benefit from unpacking those feelings with a pro if she doesnt want too than she doesnt and you let these other adults sort it out your assumptions about how she should feel or behave are not going to be helpful unless your opinion is asked for what needs to be addressed here its weirder to me that youre fixating on this as if its a problem then it would be even if your perception was accurate shes not vague posting or putting anyone on blast i eat more take out when my partner and i fight if he ever tried to address that id tell him to get bent and order a pizza if you cannot handle this date someone your own age andor someone with a fundamentally different relationship with social media it didnt read callous to me wrong to do it front of the cameras sure but we wouldnt have reality,AuthorC
tv at all without that error in judgment my dad would give me that kind of straight talk and i love him for it he calls me on my shit and as i grow up i call him on his the layers to her is that she isnt actually a very smart or clever manipulator shes tossing wet noddles at the wall to see what sticks shell grovel one day and be back to fuck off the next there is only what she wants in the moment we assume people like vanessa are brilliant and machiavellian and making dastardly moves looking ten steps ahead shes not she reactive and performative shes willful not intelligent i can empathize with her when she is hurt but it doesnt change the fact that everyone on this show or watching this show has been given plenty of reasons to just not engage with her sometimes when you treat an entire group of people as poorly as vanessa has treated so many of the people in this group you,AuthorC
dont get to come back from it youre not entitled to a second chance sometimes youre just out if it werent for the show everyone except maybe xander would cut her out for good and thatd be valid imo this this is my only read i feel like im in the twilight zone reading the op xander screams baby gay to me shes immature because yes lots of people who come out later in life are missing some core relationships skills and go through a second adolescence but xander is inexperienced not malicious vanessa is terrifying and its not the fucking edit its 9 sentences out of 10 that come from her mouth scream abuser internalized misogyny is a beast some women being shitty to other women means women are human not that shitty men are correct about all women your friend is deeply emotionally immature this kind of toxic dynamic was always a risk and you cannot fix him tell him whatever the fuck youd like about your concerns but dont lie to,AuthorC
yourself your friend is nearly 40 and hes picking this hes that kinda guy the only thing you can really speak to is the boundaries you want in the shared space steve is gonna need to figure this out on his own men know other men are dangerous most men think other men should be dangerous or are incapable of not being dangerous and then blame woman for acting on this knowledge and choosing any strategy for safety that doesnt include having sex with him like even if this was remotely true wouldnt the obvious issue be that wealthy and affluent man are hoarding 70 of young woman and yet you want to return to a strict patriarchy where wealthy and affluent men would have the full power of the state backing them up as they hoard access to women if you want women to be a commodity an object or a slave you whiners end up not being able to afford one either that or youre a commie it seems there are much,AuthorC
more serious problems here if you think this is how you need to be compensated for sticking by him and are feeling this insecure about how much he values you i think you should both talk more openly about other expenses and savings goals and if youre going into this marriage with a now you owe me attitude that is something to resolve with a counsellor first that is gonna suck for you both want what you want have your preferences it is your reasons here that are concerning even if he wants to keep this friendship its the boys who need to be doing the damn work at this point i dont know why op is so set on managing them as if they are kindergarteners in her classroom youve asked this before and the response remains the same you cant fix it its not yours to fix this is who this best friend is its your bfs job to address it at this point declining invitations is one way to address it,AuthorC
and as long as your bf keeps this person in his life this is a pattern that is likely to repeat from time to time stop taking so much on yourself youve apologized youre open to being around them thats all the fixing you can do you cannot control other people the 1987 survey of youth in custody found that 70 did not grow up with both parents internationally there is no question that children raised in single parent homes are more likely to offend but so are children raised with stepparents or with exposure to violent neighbourhood crime this is just scapegoating women who parent and the fact he takes aim at the more educated ones is particularly absurd like you said this is about poverty not the bad woman who decided poverty was better than partnership or had the misfortune of having a child with a man who choose to walk away he gets so close to realizing poverty is the problem and that toxic masculinity is behind a hell of a,AuthorC
lot of these single mothers so close its right there ready to bite him but he cannot manage it must be the womens fault the educated ones who actively choose separation whose usually equally affluent partners are actually most likely to remain present coparents to some degree the ones whose children are least likely to experience poverty and the risks associated with lower socioeconomic status its their fault not the men who walked away from women who who were much less well equipped to survive not the men who made poverty look that much better than marriage never the men i have not yet met the woman who confuses herself with a small number of bird species so he uses irrational emotional outbursts to silence your legitimate concerns and uses one long ago mistake you made to justify his ongoing poor treatment of you yeah op youre being emotionally abused the three things you describe there are the very positive characteristics of my brother he is 17 this isnt entitlement to money this is,AuthorC
entitlement to respect and transparency respect would have been a transparent conversation early on at the very beginning offering clarity that this was a shared plan not a gift and that the expectation was they would split expenses respect is not one person especially not the much higher earner declaring that all things shall be 5050 henceforth after the plans are already set in motion he didnt request financial equity he tried to enforce it over 100 so he can feel justified when he enforces it next time on 10000 again without any transparent and respectful conversation he tried to coerce her into an agreement he could lean on in the future as an absolute he tried to bully her into proving she was a not a golddigger but we all know hes probably going to keep treating her as if she is one even if she pays up not okay or at least ask his partners budget before picking a hotel for a trip he suggested exactly this this guy is treating op,AuthorC
like a golddigger and choosing to test her over 100 op has 100 understood the situation correctly and should simply decline to go further with someone who is functioning on the assumption shes using him for his money nothing she does will ever prove otherwise to the sort of man who would test like this instead of talking about at the very beginning of the planning like an actual adult its not about the money or even the income its about someone declaring the only fair way to split costs is 5050 no discussion no invitation no question of the budget prior to the plans going forward just the presentation of a bill two months in this is unacceptable this is not best behaviour i prefer to split things 5050 generally speaking but i will not date a person who declares it the only possible way to operate especially not if there is a large discrepancy in resources i have been in situations before with higherearner partners who pressured me to keep up with,AuthorC
spending because it was only fair i have also been the higher earner so i have always been extremely clear with what is a gift and what is an expectation at the very beginning of any plans otherwise its not fair it is not kind its not a respectful way to discuss expenses and i dont want to be in a relationship that involves this sort of nickelanddiming ive been there it sucks it is a small bill today because it is a test its a test to see if he can pressure her into paying without a transparent and respectful conversation about budget or expectations hes trying to create an agreement that 5050 is the only way to go so he can enforce that in the future its not an okay way in my book to approach this conversation even if splitting this particular expense makes total sense hes testing op is a really shitty way and op should feel free to fail and look for someone who communicates transparently and respectfully this,AuthorC
guy has communicated that he will probably always view her as a golddigger no matter how she behaves get rid of him i wouldnt date someone who made 5x what i did and felt that 5050 was the only fair way to handle costs that is going to lead to complete financial ruin for the lowerearner partner you know hes testing you you know hes the one who just failed dont get into a debate with him just let him know youve decided against continuing with him block him when he doesnt exhibit grace and respect you walk away shes been very clear you need to respect it you learn to manage your own emotions and stop trying to take ownershipsave her from hers minimize your contact with herthe group until you are able to behave with respect someone has sent me a video of you during a party and now im really concerned about your safety with the people you hang out with i need to ask you some questions so i can,AuthorC
know youre safe now id say that id have to it seems very obvious to me that whoever sent you this video intended to shame your bf and bully him further the first thing you need to do is be clear it did not work your concern needs to be for his safety and your clear communication needs to be that nothing he does no matter how drunk he gets validates or excuses people treating him this way do not be the tool of his bullies be clear that his safety from abusers is your only concern if he says he is stays the fuck away from those people tell him youre glad and youre proud of him ask if he wants to talk about it any further dont demand the only answer you need is that he is currently safe from danger and abuse if its selfimposed then its not a ruleagreement with your partner its a personal choice you would make for yourself with any partner but to be entirely honest as,AuthorC
a bisexual woman id still probably avoid getting too deeply involved even if you swore up and down it was entirely personal and your partner didnt even care because it just reflects that common attitude that sex between women isnt real sex youre entitled to a personal choice other people can have personal feelings about that choice consigned as a bisexual woman this implies to me that any sex and connection im having with the woman is lesser than purely on the basis of my gendergenitals a personal choice is fine and all i have lived much of my adult life with only one penis but it was never a policy it was just who was in the mix at the time and we cannot pretend these sorts of attitudes towards sex that doesnt involve a penis exist in a magic little bubble they exist in a context that id rather not operate in no the mother would likely need to be extremely illmalnourished to begin with in order to end a pregnancy this,AuthorC
way with any reliability two weeks of deprivation would be totally insufficient for most reasonably healthy adult women young wolves become way more vocal yipping and growling in ways that dont appear to be very communicative when the rest of the pack is ostracizing them for poor social graces or bullying behaviours but human beings arent wolves either okay that explains the problem more clearly but you still need to stop trying to solve it for him tell him the actual problem for you hes shown you a plan but that plan is not happening you are paying for him but he is not being honest or accountable to you hes loosing your trust and your respect stop trying to tell him how to solve it and trying to fix it for him put it back on him hes damaging the relationship being dishonest with you and being dependant on you financially its not acceptable its going to end the relationship maybe not tomorrow but eventually you will be happier and healthier without him,AuthorC

you were given the best truth as she had it to give you as she realized what she wanted more clearly she told you the fact you are trying to round up an incompatibility her own needs in a more serious relationship and her very open and direct communication with you into a lie and a betrayal is a huge part of why youre not emotionally mature enough to be dating older women this is how healthy older people date its fun for a bit if youre basically compatible but it will likely end quickly once they decide its not longterm so you meet a grownass woman who is totally clear with you shes not ready for anything serious you date for a few months and she decides its not gonna work for her longterm then she tells you so plainly and directly and you still accuse her of using you or gameplaying she just told you what she wanted and you werent it thats sad but not a betrayal that was successful communication,AuthorC

clearly just take the damn hint that hes not looking for what youre looking for and stop trying to get what you want outta him the awkwardness is a thing you can choose to ignore for yourself then you earned every downvote everyone who thought your question was insincere or combative or condescending or not worth engaging with was just objectively correct edit the fact that this got downvoted is both hilarious and pathetic that response really just supports the decisions of others to not engage with you if you want a sincere conversation in the future start by indicating youre willing to put in the effort to understand other people read through the thread ask for specific clarifications or identify common themes or things that seem contradictory to you reword what youve understood and ask if youve got it right these are skills were taught in grade school for engaging other people with ideas sincerely and respectfully and showing we are interested in comprehending new ideas dont just vaguely demand someone else spell,AuthorC
it out for you especially in the context of this sub demanding someone else just spell it out for you is going sound combative and condescending and leave the impression of a very large risk that you are the sort who jumps into this sub feeling entitled to the emotional and intellectual labour of women who you intend to shit on regardless that is why i choose to ignore you the risk outweighed any possible benefit to me and still does im very likely going to regret this if thats not who you are then dont approach it like this does it matter if youre not compatible then youre not compatible it doesnt matter very much if that is personal or cultural if youre comfortable with this level of prudishness and insecurities sure i wouldnt be comfortable with this id remind her that i also kissed my ex while wearing pretty much every single shirt in my wardrobe and she had unzipped every pair of jeans i own and maybe have used every towel,AuthorC
in the house while naked she also pet my dog even kissed his little nose can he stay if she wants to be absurd lets be equal opportunity absurd i wouldnt spend thousands of dollars to appease the irrational insecurities of someone im just dating especially not if they were phrasing it as a demand and not a request for support and understanding even though its a bit silly no this is a terrible idea shes either looking to wound herself with this information or shes gathering ammunition to wound you with this question is inherently combative and controlling it can only damage your relationship tell her she needs to trust you to maintain appropriate boundaries with people you find attractive as you always have before and that if this conversation is going to be a productive one its time to get the counsellor involved and examine what she is trying to achieve with this line of questioning i didnt say there werent many good things but look at what this bad thing is,AuthorC
cause its a fricking huge one 1 he felt unsafe speaking with you about his unhappiness and concerns 2 you two disagreed about boundaries and you appear to be seeking to isolate him from external emotional support you say you dont want too but in addition to number 1 that is the toxic dynamic that is developing and deepening 3 you are now experiencing too much anxiety to join him in his regular activities or interact with people who are really important in his life its fine to decide the good outweighs the bad but the bad youve described here is massive and youre still firmly in the honeymoon phase you can decide to work this out and it might even work out but recognise that one of the important things about dating isnt just learning to work things out most of us will try to work out plenty more than we really should this sub is full of people trying to work out obvious incompatibles cheating and even outright abuse its really learning,AuthorC
what is not tolerable for you so you waste less time with basically good people who are not the right people for you its normal to maintain keepsakes especially in a private place the fact you see this as a possible confrontation is a major issue this was not thrown in your face this was privately tucked away and your stumbling sounds a hell of a lot like snooping its understandable that it upset you but the issues here are obviously whatever insecurities youve got going on he didnt do anything to you he didnt do anything wrong youre doing all this misery to yourself you should be talking to him about those and maybe seeking support and treatment for them this book should be a nonissue the fact you think sentimental objects are disrespectful is absolutely not a universal opinion and frankly its a rather immature one one id expect from someone closer to 18 than 30 its been four months these sorts of issues so early on can and should be dealbreakers,AuthorC
in another situation id tell you that you cannot obsess about your side and that your partner needs to have people in their life they can confide in about their struggles and concerns while there can and should be some boundaries relationships cannot be emotional prisons you shouldnt want to isolate your partner from their support network you must trust and respect those people understand they are only hearing one perspective most people do understand that but in this situation why are you trying so hard to make it work when it so clearly isnt dont worry about this guy hes not the issue this is not about apologizing are you getting medical support for your mental health right now youre in a really bad way and making really bad choices for yourself you just need to end all contact with this guy and get yourself some serious support and medical intervention this sequence of events was not about him it was about the bpd you need serious focused invention and treatment for your,AuthorC
bpd no id say maybe big maybe if your true intention was simply to apologize for wrong doing but it isnt this is condescending youre talking about her like she was a secondary character in your life existing only to assist in your growth underneath this all is the assumption she requires your apologyinput in order to move on with her own life you know thats not right you havent spoken in years you know nothing you have nothing to offer except a sincere apology and what youve written here it not that sincere apology what youve written here is an inwardlooking bit of journaling about what a great person youve become this is selfcentring and personal validation not an apology its great if its all true for you but that has no value to her nearly every time i hear a longtime ex reach out to apologize i end up rolling my eyes its almost always just selfishness and guilt and they are using the other person to make themselves feel better demanding,AuthorC
attention to an apology that is not really an apology but is about making themselves feel better is just not a good look dont do it the most important thing is to relax and keep on living your life youre just talking its been good but its just talking hes moving its reasonable to believe hes probably not dodging you moving is highly timeconsuming and brainspaceconsuming right now you are penpals trying to move things forward right away wouldnt be sensible or kind id suggest you not fight that and just accept it hoping that its temporary but not overinvesting youre going to stay penpals until at least a week after the move so think about how much time you want to give to a penpal and offer this connection only that much time once hes moved give him 23 days and then suggest a few days youre free and even a suggestion of a placeevent especially if he doesnt know his new area well if he doesnt confirm within the first week or,AuthorC
so of moving cut him loose you cannot force this you cannot speed it up what you can do is decide how much of your energy youre gonna give this connection between now and when hes moved absolutely they have issues the one in my area is very closely moderated often to the frustration of new members but even still however there are also guys from online dating who are posted several times a month for cheating stalking stealthing and all sorts of acts from really rude to greedy to outright violent i absolutely suggest my friends on online dating be in that group to know who the repeat offenders in the city are but if you look at all the posts not just the juicy ones most get nothing but a good luck or even i worked with him he seemed cool this is totally old school analogue behaviour the whisper network in a digital space the criticism i hear from women is all like yours be critical of what you read check,AuthorC
for the big risks not the whining but too many men are just terrified someone will say something mean about them as if they have never trash talked as ex or a hook up to their buddies and dont realize these networks exist because of a longterm systemic lack of safety for women a woman who writes the above just really really hates other women and still thinks perfect judgment can protect her from a skilled manipulator and abuser you might want to read some relationship books written more recently or by someone under 40 that sounds a bit regressive even for the 80s we are socialized in gendered ways sure but this kind of bullshit does more harm than good when two individuals are trying to understand one another this man isnt going to save you he doesnt see you as a serious longterm partner and he isnt willing to take the kind of risks or make the kinds of investments an adult often would with a serious longterm partner on top of,AuthorC
all of that you dont trust him he lies this man isnt your safety whats worse he made just be a distraction and an obstacle keeping you from making other plans for yourself ugh im so sorry im glad it sounds like you were able to keep yourself safe in the end it happened last summer in ohio her rapist was arrested and she was able to get the medical care she needed in indiana her mother was advised the abortion wouldnt be legal in ohio under their heartbeat law women are also the default care givers for small children so many women needs the legal structure of a divorce to protectcare for any dependants i love these she dumped me for no reason stories one ex said i dumped him for getting a tattoo she didnt like he got that tattoo while wastedhigh at a festival trip after promising me to stay sober and not make me play mommy instead i spent the second day to checking every medical tent and then the,AuthorC
local er i eventually found him outta his mind in another er on iv fluids without his passport or our train tickets home but sure it was the ugly tattoo not the 48 hours of terror and trauma followed by the cost of the hotel room and flight while i helped him sort his shit out with the embassy and hoped he wouldnt get arrested i think theres a lot of complex intersectionality going on here and we cant really tell you much about the patterns in your neighborhoods or the ones you walk through their behaviour towards you could reflect biases in policing in the area or their jobfamily businesses or a dozen other things about the communities make up i walk through sort of three distinct neighbourhoods to get to my office each day and each of them presents unique risks and people respond differently to me based on how im dressed in one of them dressing more affluently will make me invisible in another it makes me a target in one,AuthorC
wearing my more artsy queer coded clothes makes me everybodys friend in another really dirty looks and sometimes comments i think most street harassment comes down to punishment for being conspicuous for taking up space a reminder from men they own the space and youre just moving through it taking up space is it gonna look different in different neighbourhoods and at different times even if it was true how is she should suffer with me because im suffering a good outcome for anyone if this were true then the women in this situation are doing a beneficial bit of emotional and practical labour for them both by ending it oh fuck yes graduation and entering the workforce is one of the biggest transitions of your life so far dont underestimate the freefloating anxiety totally reasonable uncertainty that kind of moment brings thats stressful for the normies please do consider putting a few of the avoidable battles back on the shelf for the time being live to fight another day i promise you itll,AuthorC
pay off in the long run to be strategic about this personal development notice how a shitty relationship where you or your partner is miserable much of the time seems to still be a rather good deal for men its as if there is a great deal they benefit from in a partnership besides being happy and for women there is very little to be gained by being partnered if you are unhappy the idea that women are more likely to leave a bad relationship is not an insult against womens character it just says something very sad about what men consider good enough and workable for themselves especially when they are not the ones doing the work she failed his test the test to see how much shed accept from him that is what triggered his explosion when she said maybe i dont want to accept this much i agree op was also testing used passive aggression and needs to asset herself better but thats because then she wouldnt waste three months with,AuthorC
a man who wants to to play bullshit games not because she caused his verbal abuse and transparent attempts to manipulate her exactly this he wasnt confused he was tactical these are strategies that work for him op has plenty of flaws that make her an appealing target for this sort of man and a partner in his toxic dance but that doesnt absolve him ops response was imperfect shes a great target for his style of bullshit but like i said he knew exactly what manipulation he was engaging in at that moment there was no reason to tell her about the text or his response except to test and trigger her he didnt ask her because he cared he asked her as part of the test he was training her not to protest his behaviour and learning how to best manipulate her and when she failed the test by beginning to question and stand up for her own needs and boundaries he went on an overblown attack to threaten and coerce her,AuthorC
into silence classic all my exes are crazy behaviour from this man only thing to do is block him and move on any further contact will continue to bring out the worst in op fellow panic disorder here and i completely relate to if i didnt challenge this id do nothing i had to manage panic around things like picking up the phone learning to drive and getting on planes but if nonmonogamy regularly triggered full blown panic i wouldnt do it one of the most valuable tools i have is pick your battles no that is too many battles put some back pick like two battles when i first started to really address my anxiety i thought i had to fight and defeat all my demons i put myself in a lot of unnecessarily triggering situations that actually made it harder to reach equilibrium and practice the skills because i was constantly pressuring myself to perform under intense anxiety when i stated to focus on the battles that were personally worth it to,AuthorC
me things really started to click driving was 100 worth it getting on a boat absolutely not worth it i can live a very full and rich life without boats maybe this is a battle you want to pick but please give yourself some grace and make sure youre really picking it because its a worthwhile one for you and if it is consider putting some of the other battles on the back burner for a while dont try to everything all at once manage your energy and give yourself real recovery time time to recover and reflect is where you really firm up your tools and tactics otherwise you risk just burning yourself out major toxic fights in the first three months are a huge red flag he doesnt want to be a boyfriend he wants to appear single at least to his guy friends he doesnt care how that makes you feel hes 34 not 21 hes not confused he knows exactly how he was manipulating you and leaving you feeling insecure,AuthorC
and begging for his commitment and transparency stay the fuck away from him block him grieve it out and move on with your life its actually rather cool its a real thing but the stupidest thing about this comment is that it was found largely to be fetal cells like from their sons so yes they checked it was that some studies have shown that up to 60 of women who have given birth to a son retain some of his cells it is naturally assumed they also retain their daughters cells but i havent seen studies for that in my admittedly shallowish reading they have also found some cells of older siblings in the younger ones and obviously twins and blood transfusions its just really not that big of a deal this seems to be a myth that came up in 2017 based on a study of women with male children outta seattle in 2012 but they decided to conflate the findings of male dna in the brain with the idea that the,AuthorC
women were promiscuous and the dna was from multiple sex partners instead of what they actually were women who had sons thats worse all of that is worse he treated you at least as badly as her but she had the sense to make the boundaries she needed for herself and cut him loose it also sounds like he used you to try to emotionally manipulate her while he was lying to you this is so much worse her im trying to access a very basic prescription and also maybe not be maliciously imprisoned or murdered by the state any advice him shouts irrational insulting assumptions about her body and sexual pleasure into the void hes not confused hes tactical you were convenient hes not capable of being alone hell make plenty of excuses for himself and most of them will be lies dont gaslight yourself they are what they do not what they say and what he did was making himself available to his ex for your entire relationship not just the first,AuthorC
few months 9 months outta 10 that just means he hasnt hit her up super recently he never stopped id walk this is his shit to overcome and he didnt probably wont but im his age and hes dating a woman over a decade younger then him because he assumes he can get away with this shit during her benefit of the doubt era he might last until you hit your knows her worth era a man who is 35 and behaved like he did is not capable of being mentally health alone which means hes not capable of being with anyone else either 4 year olds when they are called kiddo 24 year olds when they are called kiddo me when my friend since kindergarten calls me sis me when my catty sil does its almost like context and intent matter in human communication this guy youre the real racist for not conforming to my sexist and racist stereotypes about you i would consider the friendship done his behaviour was horrible and your,AuthorC
response was not productive but it doesnt really matter generally speaking i wouldnt keep a friend around who is clearly expressing a sense of entitlement to my sexualromantic interest and there is really no other rational interpretation here he wasnt defending white men in general they are doing just fine and dating plenty of women are asian decent generally speaking he was attacking you for not being a specifically available option to him and that is someone you need to stay the hell away from regardless of the racism angle it would encourage women to buy toys and cohabitate with one another so as not to become a indentured servant there would be less children but possible a rush in sperm donors because youre making having children via sex even riskier that it already is let spare a moment of shame for the guy who keeps trying to get him on mic best case senecio this random guy is going through some shit put the camera down and walk the fuck away stop encouraging,AuthorC
this performance its normal for people to grow apart especially at this stage of young adulthood theres no going back there is not much chance of fixing it if youre this confused about what it even is after this much silence and blocking drama allow it to end grieve it out and move on your daughter is currently being abused your ex is trying to estrange her from you with lies about her own criminal violent potentially fatal actions that us lying likely some gaslighting and its generally emotional abuse designed to isolate your daughter from you your daughter is currently the victim of emotional abuse do not forget that or gloss over it that is what is happening here while you do not have the legal power to stop it at this time that is what is taking place your ex is actively abusing her just keep persuing the parental ordercustody agreement speak to a lawyer about your choice not to pursue criminal charges you should not have made that call without legal,AuthorC
advice about how it would impact the custody situation if you dont already have one a lawyer will probably recommend a evaluation where a mental health professional will issue an opinion on whether or not you had a mental breakdown andor false memory document all acts of estrangement tell your ex youre only going to discuss parenting right now over email follow up with any inperson conversations with an email that says as we discussed in person today let her reply in writing that she didnt intend to say she asked you to lie and say you stabbed yourself youre not going to be able to repair your relationship with your daughter much further at this time she is not going to be able to read and comprehend the police reports medical reports or protection orders for many years your daughter is 11 years old and all her basic survival needs are met by her mother shes gonna side with her mother its just a basic human thing that is where her safety and,AuthorC
her food comes from youre gonna be coasting for a few years you need to seriously reconsider your legal options in regards to the stabbing youre not protecting your daughter if you are making it more difficult for her in the future to discern the truth about what happened youre also not protecting your daughter or anyone else around your ex from further acts of violence you dont youve already explained plenty he had actively chosen not to understand and ignore your boundaries you thought maybe you could be friends but his further treatment of you proved that you could not he wasnt friendly he continued to be boundarybusting and manipulative youre not a therapist or a rehab centre for sad boys expect him to continue to overreact and be ready to reenforce the boundaries that youre happy enough to hang out with him in a group but you asked for the texts to stop when they didnt you stopped them leave him blocked youve communicated clearly you can divorce someone for any reason,AuthorC
youd like but i do think you need to calm down if this is a hard boundary for you discuss it with him ask for his agreement to stop express to him you are willing to consider divorce if he will not but for my own sake i find this behaviour immature not a betrayal its just kinda ugly like a grown man having swimsuit illustrated posters on his bedroom wall it is strange to me because pumpkin spice is a mix that humans have loved since the late 18th century when we finally became globally connected enough to concoct it there is even a bit of evidence of this spice mix as far as 3500 years ago good things taste good most of us loved this before it was branded psl in hand not pinned to the back of your head like 90s barrette your boyfriend suggested something if it will make you feel less insecure you need to work on your insecurities in therapy what he said was careless not an insult,AuthorC
he fell into your baggage you need to pick some of this shit up off the floor its a tripping hazard and dont bleach your vulva its unhealthy you cannot fix the situation but saying i know this sucks and its a thing you need to get through that sucks will probably be validating shitty things be shitty sometimes the best help you can give someone when they are really in the dark part of it is is just agree this is shitty you feel shitty because it is shitty tell me how i can help you get through the shitty part first ask her what support she wantsneeds second recognize she is having a totally valid emotional reaction to something that is 100 true the arts field is deeply unfair that is hard to get a job and almost nothing pays well there is a whole bunch of earning your shot and being a team player and paying your dues that you can basically only afford to do if you come from money,AuthorC
and she was burnt out and dissatisfied in her last job she feels lost because she is that is a totally reasonable place for a person to be at 27 shes not broken shes 100 normal i know a hundred people who continued to work in the arts after this sort of period in their lives and i know a hundred who left both choices are valid but the choice will need to be made in time some shortterm depression is not a completely unreadable response to the situation shes experiencing especially when you stick a damn pandemic on top of it do not say she knew what she signed up for of course she did she doesnt need you treating her like a child with that kind of comment but she didnt know how it would feel she didnt know what the limits or stressors would be longterm she didnt know she wouldnt like it and it wouldnt be worth it she felt reasonably at one point in her life that she was,AuthorC
making the best choices for herself it is possible you could have found yourself having the same crisis of faith about your choices in it so dont be a condensing shit about it just because art was her previous choice it wasnt a bad one it just isnt working out keep encouraging therapy because she deserves the support dont encourage professional networking until she has a more concrete purposegoal in mind to be able to hurt her back for no damn reason while her legs cramp and fall asleep and wear mocha fraps in her hair all while dreaming of doing battle with a poorly photoshopped northamerican kaiju also i am deeply disappointed that they just greyscaled the image of a rooter instead of at least picking a photo of a black one like they come in black roosters come in black google black rooster dammit lazy shitposters from the little window we have here it does seem like he is incapable of offering her anything but negativity and harsh judgement she may have,AuthorC
told the group in an effort to pressure him to perform as if he was supportive and happy for her for at least a damn second oh to have the ego of a mediocre man who doesnt even think the posting rules apply to him what i could have achieved in life with this oblivious and inflated sense of selfworth i think she is in the wrong objectively but youre not coming at this objectively youre coming at this emotionally and trying to use a money agreement in the relationship to solve your unhappiness and money issues with a situation she is not in control of your employment i can understand why she would be upset when you frame this as financially punishing her because you hate your job that it isnt what it is but its sure what you make it sound like you need to stop making assumptions about her savings and you need to stop attacking this emotionally objectively if that space is her office especially if she intends to get,AuthorC
personal tax benefits or write offs for it then its not part of your shared home thats not about your budget or your job that is her being honest with herself with you and the irs about what her business costs to run and what resources it requires it requires a room just like it requires certain software or licenses its a business expense not a relationship one it belongs to business not to you or to her personally the business needs to be renting that room the business owner needs to pay that isnt about the boyfriendgirlfriend agreement thats about the business owing money its not paying and you need to be seriously looking for other work she may be unfair and maybe you should break up but generally speaking its also not fair to be constantly at your partner because youre miserable and not doing anything to fix that for yourself i wouldnt want to be married to either of you yelling is unacceptable to me however so are constant accusations especially,AuthorC
public drunken ones what you are doing isnt being insecure were all a bit insecure you sound like you have long ago crossed the line into emotionally abusing your husband most people will not accept emotional abuse forever without snapping snapping might look like yelling but it can also look like withdrawing running away or sobbing hysterically people break under that kind of treatment longterm they just do its called reactive abuse if he we were here asking for him id be telling him he probably needs to leave you before you bring out the worst in him and his behaviour gets worse because you are unlikely to seriously change yours stick with the therapy and discuss this incident there in the context of your behavior towards him if you need to discuss how costs are split in you relationship you have to do that before you agree to go and pay for the ticket youre not wrong but you made a mistake not discussing the impact of this wedding trip on your budget,AuthorC
before you agreed to go if you do speak to him about this start there i made a mistake i should have told you before we booked that this was more than i could comfortably spend i wish i hadnt bothered tho this guys posting history is a nightmare before it was complaining his wife wasnt communicative enough with only the most weakass arguments shed done anything at all wrong and right here were seeing exactly why his wife has learned not to speak to him even when the information is totally banal he takes the opportunity to shit on her instead of supporting her so he doesnt believe in being accountable to other human beings and honest about his commitments youre 25 and pregnant you need to wake the hell up youre trying to make it complicated because you dont like the simple truth everyone else gets it just fine he definitely gets it youre the one who doesnt want too hes doing exactly what he wants if he wanted to be at,AuthorC
those appointments he would be if he wanted to be dating you he would be he doesnt and he probably never will stop trying to fix it and start learning to live with him as a coparent agreeing not to fuck other people is not the same as being a partner same answer hes not your partner its not stable with him hes not offering you that he is doing exactly what he wants and he doesnt want to be your support in this the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being im sorry youre not ready for that reality sooner you get there the better off youll be i just dont want to break up with him its a situationship by definition you are not together we have a rocky relationship but we want to do better for our daughter great you need,AuthorC
to realize the best you can do probably doesnt include dating one another i wanna start by finding a way to have him go to the baby appts mkre you cannot turn him into either a good partner or a good parent hes gonna be who he wants to be and you need to make your peace with that dude you were absolutely implying that she was incompetent and that you didnt trust her researchjudgment call despite the fact this was an ongoing issue for her and you knew shed taken previous steps you may really think you didnt intend it but intention actually isnt everything what you atually did was shitty and her emotional response to being treated that way was predictable and reasonable it is a damn small thing and you were a selfabsorded ass about it got to be honest with you if i was opening the garage by hand for a single week my partner would have declared that unacceptable and built a plan to correct that situation before i,AuthorC
even got around to it you should apologize and do better treat her like the competent adult she is and dont expect her to struggle with a daily task for months just because it doesnt impact you and then throw shade when she says its time to resolve the issue sesh youre 35 this is rather basic courtesy and empathy it is not rocketscience i think you feel like a single mom because you are one stop the situationship just be coparents hes not your partner hes not the partner you want hes just your coparent and you cant force him to be a good parent you can only give him opportunities to be one the longer you imagine you can turn him into either a good partner or a good parent the harder it will be for you to move forward with your life as a mother and as a human being let it go and focus on being coparents she doesnt sound all that more toxic than you to be perfectly honest,AuthorC
go be better with someone else and find some grace when it comes to the woman who is the mother of your child your animosity over her sex life is pointless and counterproductive you may not be able to create a home with her and your son but you can create a coparenting relationship where you butt the hell out of exes sex life and focus on just being a parent and not fixating on your role as jilted or resentful ex you probably want to begin by trying to connect with an individual therapist not a couples therapist to get you a place to talk through the particulars and make some thoughtful choices you want to leave the house and in the short term that is probably a good idea but you may want to speak to a lawyer if youre concerned about how that impacts your legal standing staying close by would definitely be wise and maintaining regular contact and support for the children if it doesnt matter where you live then,AuthorC
you live near were your children are right now that is the default i dont know where you are living but you should recognize it takes way more than a night in jail to stop you from seeing your children the child have a right to know you and have access to you and no court is throwing that right of the children away over a verbal fight catastrophizing isnt going to help you here what is going to help you is focusing on being a present and available parent that should be the foundation of your decisions but get some distance in the shortterm and some support from an individual therapist and a lawyer he definitely wants to fix it if this has been your whole relationship and hes never spoken to a therapist or sought a sliding scale or a free support group or read a damn selfhelp book from the library then he doesnt really want to fix it he wants to seem like he wants to fix it so youll,AuthorC
continue to tolerate it youre both benefiting in some way from this unhealthy dynamic and you both need to admit it to yourself and eachother he needs to realize this has to be fixed if he wants a healthy relationship with anyone ever and certainly if he wants to marry you he may hate this about himself but as long as he tolerates it about himself it has the impact of guilting and silencing his partner you cant remedy this for him he has to do it for himself and for you this was my ex too i tried desperately to point out that hed reply with no as the first word out of his mouth even when i was 99 correct or if had just used a wordterm he deemed less accurate then the one in his head he expected me to make all the effort to make myself understood but not to have to put himself out for a second to try and understand i wouldnt i would text him after i,AuthorC
post it conversation can evolve from there or not make sure you know the policy at your company but if there is no risk of a direct reporting issue this is just a question of mutual interest id start by asking if shes changed her mind about porn the deception is a major problem but struggling with a change of opinion on a loaded topic like porn can be very different than a hypocrisy or betrayal unless youre in a race toward divorce your best path forward is an open conversation about porn and frame it as an upsetting and confusing but valid change in her choices and opinions and not a personal attack you saw what you saw youre confused and more than a little hurt try to put aside your assumptions about what she thinks or how she feels or even how often shes engaging with try to approach the conversation as an opportunity to reset the understanding about porn and just porn its possible she might still think its wrong and,AuthorC
be disgusted with herself which would also account for her physical withdrawal from you if she struggles to be forthcoming recommend couples counselling urgently to help moderate this important conversation dont spend too much time banging your own head against the wall and fixating on the betrayal go back to therapy and figure out what kind of relationship if any youd like to have with your mother and what steps you need to get there that could absolutely include cutting her off or minimizing contact its totally valid to feel like you do and its really mature and wise of you to be able to recognize that your mother has changed and is making efforts you dont have to feel bad youre clearly trying to be fair to her and the person she is today but that doesnt mean your feelings are totally valid be fair to yourself too and get some more support for this stage tbh i often forget this is criminal in the places where most redditors live a few times,AuthorC

financial support of the new gf he lied to you made the first right decision the second right decision is removing this person from your life but she thinks your lusting after your sister however wonderful you think you ex is that is what she thinks of you she thinks at best you lack boundaries and at worst that you are incestuously obsessed with your sister that really should be insulting and offensive enough to help you get past this your ex has shown you who she really is shes possessive and jealous and willing to make up extremely offensive insults in the attempt to isolate you from your sister and her kids you cannot fix crazy your problem is that youre trying to fix crazy and why would you want to date someone ignorant and stubborn really your exgf has decided to believe something absurd and offensive about you youre never going to reason her out of it you shouldnt be trying to work through it you should be removing someone who thinks,AuthorC
such irrational and hateful things about you from your life you need to stop seek therapy it is extremely unlikely this man was going to pick you if youd just agreed to go home with him after the first date thats not realistic its a fantasy story youre telling yourself just to beat up on yourself you keep shifting the details but the core of it remains true he met someone else it is a good idea to be upfront up walking to book a second date with someone youre into but that probably wouldnt have change the outcome here he connected more with someone else its just a rejection its a normal part of dating the way you are behaving here on reddit suggests you are not ready to be dating and handling normal rejection as part of that process stop fixating speak to a therapist stop supporting and start laying down some expectations if hes not a jealous person then the way he is treating you and n is irrational and unkind,AuthorC
that drunken attack was not acceptable he doesnt need to be coddled he needs to be told this isnt an acceptable way to deal with whatever hes feeling you have been nothing but open to working with him on this but he continues to make it your problem to live with his shitty attitude and random accusations followed by gaslightingeseque denials its not kind to you its not respectful of you he needs to do better because this is a shitty way to treat your partner who is very very willing to adapt this friendship to address your feelings stop trying to be his therapist and tell him to get his damn ass to an actual one if hes experiencing intense feelings he cannot speak with you honestly about youre incompatible and she basically said she feels she needs too and is entitled too financially punish you in order to stop you from becoming lazy why does she want to marry you if she thinks that you need to be threatened with higher costs,AuthorC
in order to perform and set goals yuck but honestly the even bigger longterm issue here is disagreements about parenting like the importance of private schooling if the rest of this doesnt scare you that should terrify you that disagreement is going to harm the children shes told you she is going to be constantly chasing status and making comparisons between your family you and everyone elses family if dont share that keeping up with the jones mentality and want to spend big to keep up public appearances then youre signing up for misery also shes way too old to be this much of a brat dont do this use the letter to sort out your thoughts but then if you really need to express these thoughts to him and have decided to take the risk do it facetoface whatever the outcome youll feel far far more confident and at peace with it if you do it face to face i promise its scarry to do things the right way to get a clear,AuthorC
answer but thats the better path and believe it or not if youre gonna get rejected itll hurt less that way if you cannot face this risk in person then you shouldnt be taking the risk at all hes not a faithful man he never has been can you be secure and healthy with someone you cannot reasonably expect to be faithful to you you are being naive these are not challenges this is him making choices major changes in character and in core choices are rare and they have to be internally motivated unless he has explained clearly why he has changed his choices moving forward for himself and the life he wants for himself and not just to appease you there is no reason to believe he will not choose what he feels perfectly entitled to choose which is to engage with sex workers and lie to you about it youre 23 you got a hell of a lot more life left i wouldnt recommend wasting any more of it on this,AuthorC
one nothing about that ran out as rhetorical to me if it was an attempt to persuade op of anything else except that you believed her to be held culpable for being emotionally abused and manipulated for years it was not well stated yet here you are claimed it was a joke to brush it off as if not trying to get him mad at you for lying to you thats pretty wild and makes no sense it makes perfect sense for someone in an eightyear partnership who is used to being silenced lied to and made deliberately distressed you stop responding reasonably to the manipulation and abuse because reasonable responses to it never stopped the behaviour in the past you get confused direct communication feels impossible that is the goal of this kind of abuse to make it feel impossible and pointless to respond in the reasonable ways with legitimate anger or clear boundaries that you assume op should it doesnt happen overnight its not all ops fault they cannot fix him by,AuthorC
being better their responses to being abused are flawed but very human this is the kind of flaws that ongoing abuse will bring out in most of us this isnt enabling this is the misfiring of survival instincts and toxic coping techiniques after years married to an emotional abuser it doesnt get better for op until op gets out youre supposed to leave the man who is either so conflict adverse he is unwilling to admit when he hasnt done something or so maliciously and gaslighting abusive that he takes pleasure in manipulating you and making you suffer this is a big deal hes acting more like an unhinged prison guard than a partner at some point it stops mattering if he does this because he is weak and fearful and cannot admit when he has failed to do something or if he does this because he takes pleasure in abusing you the end result is the same hes a gameplaying numbnut divorcee who wants to be chased even as hes telling you that,AuthorC
he is not available to be caught he wants to feel desired by you and others without actually having to offer anything of himself or do any of the hard work of being more than just nice just end contact there is nothing here for you but drama so all these people like each other more than they like you which sucks for you but isnt a fight you can win there is not letting these adults make their own choices there is only you deciding what relationships you still want to be in its not your flat youre not on the lease these other people the subletter and your girlfriend were invited by the person who does lease the flat you didnt do them an act of kindness it wasnt yours to give to them the core issue here is that your gf doesnt want to move in with you when you return shes not prioritizing living with you thats plenty of reason to decide the relationship cannot or should not continue but,AuthorC
this narrative you have about other people taking advantage of you or victimizing you is nonsense they disappointed you is all you had a room in someone elses house and that someone else has invited others instead if you dont want to continue with your gf dont but drop the rest of this bullshit id consider it a rather serious red flag if a man used the word emasculating at me in anger because i had achieved personal success or experienced personal stress both of these are human things hes telling you he thinks his achievements and his stress and carry more meaning than yours because hes a guy and youre a girl this is a serious issue you need to stop building him up about his career and instead tell him plainly that he is not entitled to rip you down because of his own twisted ideas about women and men or his own negative feelings he needs to manage his feelings without explosions of anger or gendered insults those behaviors should be,AuthorC
dealbreakers emasculating is not a word he should be using or even thinking when it comes to your career path or achievements yeah i dont get it my parents are rather happily married for 40 years they are both basically good people but they described their vows as sincere workable wishes which is the best way i think you can look at it and something i practice with my partner now its not a prison sentence its a promise to work hard and work first at this shared wish and also to stop working and go on wishing the best for one another if we find no amount of effort means we can stay in the partnership without being miserable yeah so friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves that is how you deal with a serious concern about a friends choice in partner respectfully and ill happily agree for the second time they may be toxic and we cant know i dont think youre being the critical thinker you,AuthorC
imagine you are but you do seem to be reflecting a common bias where a body you find undesirable is immediately associated with behaviour or personality you assume is undesirable as well there is nothing here that suggests op is an unreliable narrator while that is certainly possible there usually are tells i dont see any and you havent pointed any out your interpretation took way more assumptions than mine did all mine hinged on was the fiance not speaking up for his own choice to be with op clearly to his friends thats a pretty defensible take whether we completely accept ops reasoning or not fianc should still be standing up for his own choices even if those choices are mistakes you really should consider why your story the one where op must be toxic and the friends nobbling defending him from her is the one you felt compelled to tell and doubled down on because it didnt require critical thinking or skepticism it required a rather fallaciousseeming leap the devil has plenty,AuthorC
of advocates already and playing one doesnt actually make you seem interesting or insightful it just makes you sound like a motivated reasoner why do you want to imprison this man with a wife who resents him and doesnt want to be with him its not like thats a great deal for him either if op isnt able to willing to change the shared goals and expectations she has then he deserves to be free of her just as much as she deserves to be free of him and do you think people didnt walk away from their partners constantly in the previous centuries due to poverty or illness cause they did in droves sometimes with a bit of social shaming but far less than you might imagine men more than women which is not a comment so much on mens general character as it is their power and agency to leave a undesirable situations and seek greater comfort and convenience elsewhere its so funny how individualism went awry just the time as when,AuthorC
women achieved the most basic human rights and the ability to leave situations they found intolerable no we dont get to dictate how others deal with objects or memories from experiences that were traumatic or abusive op can absolutely bring his feelings and needs forward but she doesnt have to do this because the ex was abusive if anything the fact he was abusive may contribute to her connection to objects that represent the positive aspects of the relationships because all abusers have some positive traits at times that is how they entrap it does to me but also these are very stupid and desperate criminals unlike the magic power to declassify documents by looking at them he retained that until the very last second and then some yes id recommend these things get put away in a drawer and from there you suck it up not because your feelings are irrational but because grief especially grief and processing after long term abuse are super fucking complicated you can ask her to do this,AuthorC
work for you and your comfort that fair if its a thing you really need and boundaries you need to revisit but id recommend you not force the issue shes very likely to let go of more in time but two years after seven of abuse is not full processing time for most people shes probably not holding onto him shes preserving the story of her own life you shouldnt stay in a relationship you dont want to be in your husband needs to stop gettingseekingstaying at jobs where he is either not able to succeed or his work ethic doesnt line up with expectations becoming successful is not a reasonable expectation if that is what you need its probably time to walk away go date someone who already is becoming stable reliable and less miserable should be the shared goal and expectation of him if youre going to stay that may include a major change of industry andor changes in expectations about how he will contribute laugh and then hopefully wake up from,AuthorC
the strange dream where my partner and my father are not both rational and civil men who can resolve disagreements and do not order me around like a dog we always just have ops pov they are frequently manipulating the internet for validating responses do you jump in on every thread to remind us of that fact or just the ones where you suspect the fatcard look if you think its not very probable that a group of people have deemed someone unworthy primarily due to their weight i do not know what universe youre living in cause it aint the one i inhabit ive happily agreed they may be toxic and we cant know but you seem to need more than that you should ask yourself why friends speak once and then hold their peace or remove themselves they dont speak about another persons body or level of perceived hotness as being a huge mistake while its possible these two are poorly matched or toxic there is nothing here to suggest it and,AuthorC
fianc should still be standing up for his own choices even if those choices are mistakes does it matter most of the time he kept talking about his friendsfamilycoworkers and exes and only asked about 3 questions about me the entire time and i was like no i dont kiss on the first date and we kept talking about it untill he leaned in and kissed me this man is a boundarybusting selfabsorbed asshat who is not relationship material unless youre just looking to get laid move on frankly even if you are probably want to be moving on a man that selfabsorbed and indirect in his communication is a coin flip odds are not great hes a fun lay anyways a guy who asks you nothing about yourself is rather unlikely to get you off dont so be desperate to be picked by somebody that you chase after selfish little shits who basically ignore you as a person realize you get to do the picking too and then put this one back on,AuthorC
the pile unless the earring is worth a small fortune let it go along with this guy i think the real issue here is your fiance is refusing to stand up for himself with the people he calls friends which is sad for him and it limits your life together basically he needs better friends or to tell these friends they are expected to be better or to gtfo no you probably shouldnt you should be speaking to a therapist about how to best move forward in your own life you still havent sorted out the difference between her doing something wrong and her doing something that disappointed you youre not expressing all that much love for her as a person but for the role you have cast her in and are frustrated she is no longer consenting to perform youre not owed a certain number of chances and your family as you previously envisioned it doesnt need to be back together that is your preference not a fact of the universe she doesnt,AuthorC
have to agree she doesnt agree these attitudes all make it extremely unlikely that youve done the work you need to be an independent and reliable adult and even if you had done that work she might still not want to reconcile because youre not owed a certain number of chances she can just choose not to be in a marriage she doesnt want to be in and she has take these thoughts and feelings to a therapist they do need to be addressed but not by your exwife your mother is dating an asshole and what is worse she knows it and she appears to have quietly approved of his behaviour she warned you when she should have said if you are verbally abusive to my son in yourhis workplace i will dump your childish ass dont talk to him hes not relevant to you and if youre in a union situation you should seriously consider reporting him for threatening your workdayincome because hes pissed off you didnt buy him a meal tell,AuthorC
